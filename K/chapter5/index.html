<h2>1.  The press Council of Ireland and the press ombudsman</h2>

<h3>History and background</h3>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Irish Press Council and Ombudsman system was set up in 2007 as a direct response to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the threat of legislation from the Irish Government. The Chair of the Press Council, Daith&#237;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">O&#8217;Ceallaigh, described the agreement eventually reached between the Government and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry as:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;a win-win solution&#8230;.[where] at least some of the changes in defamation law sought</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by the industry would be incorporated in a new Act and, in return, the industry would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sponsor an independent Press Council and Press Ombudsman along lines broadly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">acceptable to government.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the mid 1990s the Irish Government set up a Commission on the newspaper industry; in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1996, that body recommended the establishment of a Press Ombudsman, but no action was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> Then in 2002, the Minister for Justice, Michael McDowell, set up an expert advisory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">group which reported in 2003 with a recommendation for a statutory system of regulation for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> The industry set up a steering committee to consider its response; this committee</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">included representatives of all the major newspaper groups in Ireland, including some of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those based in the UK, namely News International and Trinity Mirror.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> This group ultimately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">developed a model for the Press Council, which was to be independent of Government and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in its operations, independent of the industry; this was the model that was adopted for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">new Council and Ombudsman in the summer of 2007.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ProfessorJohn Horgan,theIrishPressOmbudsman,explainedtotheInquiryhisunderstanding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the Press Council had been established with the<span style="font-style:italic"> quid</span><span style="font-style:italic"> pro</span><span style="font-style:italic"> quo</span> that that Government</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would withdraw its proposals for the statutory regulation of the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> At the same time,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Government agreed to use the legislative opportunity provided by the Defamation Bill in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2009 to offer some statutory underpinning for the new Council.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Professor Horgan made it clear that the industry considered there to be a very real threat</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the Government would legislate for press regulation in the absence of an adequate self-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory solution:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: But behind it all, do I gather from what you were saying</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">somewhat earlier, was the threat of statutory regulation?</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Absolutely.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: So in other words, it behoved the press interests to come up</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with a solution that was less than the club that was being held over them?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. That is absolutely the case. And in fact my membership, or our membership of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Alliance of Independent Press Councils of Europe indicates that in quite a few countries</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this threat has been the engine which has generated or promoted the successful</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">establishment of press councils of the same kind in many European countries.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So even though before this threat was made, there had been moves towards the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">establishment of something like this, the 1996 report of the commission, which wasn't</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">under such a threat, recommended the establishment of an ombudsman. As I said, it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was the real and present danger of that that created the situation in which we found</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">ourselves.&#8221;</span>

<h3>Legal recognition</h3>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">InpracticetheDefamationAct2009setoutsomefairlydetailedrequirementsforthestructure,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">coverage and operation of a Press Council before it could be recognised under the legislation;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this meant that, whilst the detail of both the code of practice and the complaints mechanism</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were left to the industry to set, the broad framework was dictated by the legislation if the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry wanted to take advantage of the protection offered by the Act. Professor Horgan</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">told the Inquiry:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;without the benefit of knowledge of what went on behind closed doors in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">four years leading up to the creation of the Press Council, it might be thought that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this legislation represents a framework imposed by the state on the private sector.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Whereas in fact &#8211; and Professor Thomas Mitchell has briefed me extensively on this &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by and large the provisions relating to the Press Council that found their place in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Defamation Act were those proposed by the Press Council itself to the government.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is scope within the Act for the industry collectively to decide not to create a Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council, and for any individual journal to decide not to participate. However, the Press Council</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Ireland, as currently constituted, was established before the Act came into force and all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significant publishers of newspapers in Ireland are members of the Council.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></span>
<h4>Benefits</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Act provides a defence of &#8216;fair and reasonable publication&#8217; to a defamation action.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the case of a statement published in a periodical by a person who at the time of publication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was a member of the Press Council, a court in considering whether publication was fair and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasonable may take into account the extent to which the person adhered to the code of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards of the Press Council and abided by determinations of both the Press Ombudsman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the Press Council.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> There was, as yet, no case law on this.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup> Professor Horgan clarified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this did not mean that the defence was only available to those who had signed up to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system. The defence was also available, in theory, to other publications if they could satisfy</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">the court that they operated to standards and procedures in no way inferior to those of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council. Similarly, this had not been tested in court and Professor Horgan said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;My honest view it that it would be quite difficult for publications that are not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">members of the Council to satisfy a court that they operate to such standards.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In order to enact these benefits, the Act makes provision for the Minister, by order, to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognise a body as &#8220;the Press Council&#8221; for the purposes of the Act. The requirements for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognition are specific and detailed and it is worth setting them out here to show the extent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to which the Defamation Act establishes the objectives and the structural independence of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Press Council, the approach to dealing with complaints and the overarching coverage of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the code of standards.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Only one Press Council may be recognised at any one time. Before the Press Council can</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be recognised the Minister must satisfy himself that it meets the specifications set out in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Schedule 2 to the Act. He can revoke the recognition at any time he considers that the Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council fails to meet the specifications in the Schedule.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup> So far this power has been used</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">once, in April 2010, to recognise the Press Council of Ireland as &#8216;the Press Council&#8217;.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Schedule 2 of the Act requires that the Press Council should have the principle objectives of:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>

<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;"><li>ensuring the protection of freedom of expression of the press,</li></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;"><li>protecting the public interest by ensuring ethical, accurate and truthful</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reporting by the press,</li></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;"><li>maintaining certain minimum ethical and professional standards among the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;"><li>ensuring that the privacy and dignity of the individual is protected.</li></span>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Interestingly, Professor Horgan told the Inquiry that the primary purpose of the Press Council</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">was:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;to maintain the rights of the press to freedom of expression, to maintain the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">independence of the press from the State and State control or regulation and to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decide on appeals against decisions or the Press Ombudsman on complaints.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the primary role of the Press Ombudsman being:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;to receive and adjudicate on complaints, to raise public awareness of the work</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of his Office and of the Council, and to encourage and promote the highest ethical</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">standards of journalism in Ireland.&#8221;</span>

 <h4>Appointments</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-16"><a href="#para1-16" name="para1-16">1.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Act requires the Press Council to comprise 13 members, of whom seven are independent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">members representing the public interest, five represent the interest of owners and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publishers and one represents the interest of journalists.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup> The public interest members are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appointed by an independent four-person Appointments Committee, on the basis of public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advertisement and interview.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup> The Chair of the Council is appointed from within the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest members, although in practice external applications have also been invited.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup> The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry and journalist members are nominated by the various organisations that took part in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the steering committee and the Appointments Committee ratifies the nominations. Professor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Horgan explained that there was not an automatic guarantee of appointment for those who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were nominated, but he could not readily foresee a situation in which such nominations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would not be ratified.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-17"><a href="#para1-17" name="para1-17">1.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first Appointments Committee was appointed by the Press Industry Steering Committee.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">SubsequentappointmentstotheCommitteearemadebythePressCouncil.Theappointments</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are for three years; that first Committee was subsequently re-appointed for a second three</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">year term by the Council in July 2010.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup> As of August 2010, the Chair of the Council was also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Chair of the Appointments Committee.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-18"><a href="#para1-18" name="para1-18">1.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The five industry members of the Press Council are current senior editorial executives,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although not usually editors. The only serving editor currently on the Council is the editor of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a regional publication; he fills the slot effectively reserved for regional newspaper editors.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Professor Horgan suggested that the absence of serving editors has worked well for the Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council, particularly because he thought that there was more change of personnel than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might be expected if editors were to hold the seats. The appointments are for a three year</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">term, and can be extended for a second term; however, some four and a half years into the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council&#8217;s existence, only one of the original industry representatives is still a member of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-19"><a href="#para1-19" name="para1-19">1.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Professor Horgan told the Inquiry that the public interest majority on the Council was essential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the public acceptance of the independence of the model.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup> He also regarded the presence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a journalist member on the Council alongside the industry members as essential.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup></span>
<h4>Structures and Funding</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-20"><a href="#para1-20" name="para1-20">1.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In line with the requirements of the Defamation Act, the Press Council is wholly funded by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press industry. The finances of both the Press Council and the Press Ombudsman are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provided by the Administrative Committee of the Press Council; the Committee is chaired</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by an independent member of the Council but otherwise consists of representatives of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different types of publications covered, together with the NUJ. Each title covered by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council pays a levy based on circulation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup></span>

<h4>The Code</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-22"><a href="#para1-22" name="para1-22">1.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The code was originally drawn up in 2007 by the Steering Committee. There is now a Code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Committee, which is chaired by an independent retired journalist and comprises nominees of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the industry bodies. Serving editors have the right to be on the Committee but, for the most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">part, they are represented by deputies or senior executives. The Ombudsman sits on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">committee in an ex-officio capacity.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup> Any changes to the Code are made in consultation with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Council. The Council can also suggest changes to the Code Committee. There have not,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in fact, been any significant changes since the code was originally drafted.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup> It may be worth</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">noting that the code would have been available to the Government to see when formulating</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the terms of the 2009 Defamation Act.</span>
<h4>Coverage</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-23"><a href="#para1-23" name="para1-23">1.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">All national newspapers, including all the UK papers that are published in Ireland, and over</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">90% of regional newspapers, are members of the Press Council. Around 60%, by number, of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">periodicals are members of the Council, but this would account for considerably more than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">60% of circulation as the larger magazines are members.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref38" href="#footnote38">38</a></sup> Since the creation of the Council no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">members have left, or threatened to leave, the system.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref39" href="#footnote39">39</a></sup> Recently a news website has applied</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for membership and the Council is considering the appropriate criteria for membership of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">web media.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup></span>
<h4>Public awareness and satisfaction</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-24"><a href="#para1-24" name="para1-24">1.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Professor Horgan told the Inquiry that public awareness of the Press Council and Ombudsman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was limited. A public awareness campaign had been launched in an attempt to make the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">services provided by the Ombudsman more widely known.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup></span>
<h4>Impact of statute on freedom of speech and the public interest</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-25"><a href="#para1-25" name="para1-25">1.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Professor Horgan did not think that the statutory recognition afforded to the Press Council</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the Defamation Act constituted a limitation on the freedom of expression because the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">limitations in the Act were, by and large, those proposed and endorsed by the industry itself</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a necessary balancing of the right to publish against the rights of individuals.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup> The belief</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Council in the importance of the freedom of the press is reasserted in the preamble to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Code.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-26"><a href="#para1-26" name="para1-26">1.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In this context it is worth noting that all UK titles that publish in Ireland are members of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council; they do not appear to allow any principled objections to statutory underpinning of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press self-regulation to get in the way of constructive and willing participation in this system.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to interpret it on a case by case basis. The code does set out a general principle:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;that the public interest is invoked in relation to a matter capable of affecting the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people at large so that they may legitimately be interested in receiving and the press</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">legitimately interested in providing information about it.&#8221;</span>
<h3>The Press Ombudsman</h3>

<p id="para-id-1-28"><a href="#para1-28" name="para1-28">1.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Press Ombudsman primarily receives and adjudicates on complaints. The Ombudsman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is appointed by the Press Council and reports to the Council on a monthly basis in respect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of administrative matters.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup> The Ombudsman is independent of the Council in the execution</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of his functions of investigation and adjudication, but his decisions can be appealed to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council by either the complainant or the newspaper if they are dissatisfied.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup> Professor Horgan</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stressed that his contract guarantees his independence from the Council and that the Council</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had recently agreed to amend its articles of association to give him greater independence. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular the Ombudsman now has discretion to make decisions on whether someone is a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">person directly affected, and to rule out vexatious and frivolous complaints.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup></span>
<h4>Complaints</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-29"><a href="#para1-29" name="para1-29">1.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Complaints can only be made in respect of publications that are members of the Press Council</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Ireland. A complaint can relate to any article that breaches the Code of Practice or to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behaviour of a journalist that breaches the Code.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-30"><a href="#para1-30" name="para1-30">1.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Complainants are expected to go in the first instance to the publisher concerned, and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ombudsman will only consider complaints if the complainant has not received a satisfactory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reply within two weeks.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref49" href="#footnote49">49</a></sup> Professor Horgan told the Inquiry that he had:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;got a very severe telling off, which I think in the circumstances was quite justified,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from the editor of the newspaper concerned&#8230;..&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when he had, on one occasion taken a compliant directly at the request of the complainant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who had been too fearful to confront the newspaper itself.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-31"><a href="#para1-31" name="para1-31">1.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Complainants are free to take their cases to court in advance of, alongside or after a case</span>

<p id="para-id-1-33"><a href="#para1-33" name="para1-33">1.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the four years of its operation the Irish Press Ombudsman has received on average between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">340-350 complaints per year. This is roughly analogous, in proportion to population, to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number received by the PCC. There is, however, one striking difference between the outcomes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the Irish Ombudsman and those from the PCC. The Irish Press Ombudsman has reached</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a decision on nearly 12% of the complaints brought to it over its four year lifetime, which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compares to substantially less then 1% of complaints to reach adjudication with the PCC.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref55" href="#footnote55">55</a></sup> In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010 and 2011 around two thirds of the decisions of the Press Ombudsman have included</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a finding that the code was breached, with sufficient remedial action already having been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken by the publisher in up to half of those cases.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref56" href="#footnote56">56</a></sup> Comparatively few cases are conciliated,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with only 19 (6% and 5.5% respectively) conciliated in each of 2010 and 2011.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref57" href="#footnote57">57</a></sup></span>
<h4>Appeals</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-34"><a href="#para1-34" name="para1-34">1.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Either party to a complaint can appeal the decision of the Press Ombudsman to the Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council. Professor Horgan told the Inquiry that there were a substantial number of appeals in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the early years but that only very few appeals were upheld by the Press Council.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref58" href="#footnote58">58</a></sup> The figures</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provided to the Inquiry show that 53% of the decisions taken by the Press Ombudsman have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been appealed to the Council over the four years. There was a substantial dip in the level of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appeals in 2009, but otherwise the proportion of decisions appealed has been over 50% in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">every year of the Press Ombudsman&#8217;s operation. It is not obvious from the figures whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those appeals were by publishers or claimants and Professor Horgan told the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Initially quite a substantial number of my decisions would have been appealed,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">either by newspapers or by complainants, on the grounds that, well, it was free and,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you know, why not have a second bite at the cherry?&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Very few of these appeals are upheld, however, with only three appeals having been upheld</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in four years (although some 12 appeals are described as being still outstanding).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup></span>

 <h4>Standards</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-35"><a href="#para1-35" name="para1-35">1.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Ombudsman deals with individual cases and has no remit to identify or respond to any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">systemic issues which might become apparent from cases that he considers. Professor Horgan</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">told us this would be a matter for the Press Council, on the basis of its own assessment of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues before the Ombudsman and the decisions being reached. However, the Press Council</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does not have the power to conduct own-initiative investigations, and has no specific remit to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">tackle serious or systemic problems. Some efforts have been made to address systemic issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by, for example, sponsoring seminars on relevant matters.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref61" href="#footnote61">61</a></sup></span>
<h4>Sanctions</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-36"><a href="#para1-36" name="para1-36">1.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The only sanction available to the Press Ombudsman is the requirement for the newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or magazine to publish a decision upholding a complaint.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref62" href="#footnote62">62</a></sup> Professor Horgan told the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that all the major newspapers have been the subject of critical adverse findings in one form</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or another.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref63" href="#footnote63">63</a></sup> Decisions of the Press Ombudsman also frequently include a correction of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inaccurate facts.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref64" href="#footnote64">64</a></sup> Detailed guidelines have been adopted by the Council in relation to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication of a decision by the Press Ombudsman. In relation to prominence of publication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these guidelines say:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref65" href="#footnote65">65</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;(3) Those sections of decisions of the Press Ombudsman upholding a complaint</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should be published: (a) in full; (b) promptly; (c) on the same page as the original</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">article, or further forward, subject to the exception at (6) below; (d) on the same day</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the week as the original publication, (e) with similar prominence; (f) unedited; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(g) without editorial commentary by way of a headline or otherwise. In addition, each</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should carry, above the headline, a strap-line indicating that it is a decision of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Press Ombudsman.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">[&#8230;.]</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(6) Where a complaint has been upheld in relation to an article published on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">front page of a publication, the decision should be published with due prominence on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">one of the first four editorial pages.&#8221;</span>
<h4>UK titles as members</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-37"><a href="#para1-37" name="para1-37">1.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Professor Horgan told the Inquiry that UK titles accounted for 30% of membership of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council, but were responsible for around 22% of the complaints. These figures have to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">viewed with caution, however, as they make no allowance for circulation figures or other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">differences between titles.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref66" href="#footnote66">66</a></sup> In respect of the types of complaint that were received about UK</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">titles and Irish titles, Professor Horgan said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref67" href="#footnote67">67</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There&#8217;s absolutely no discernable differentiation between the basis of the complaints</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">against indigenous publications and those against UK-based publications.&#8221;</span>

<h2>2. Other models of press regulation: Europe and beyond</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In this section I consider systems of press regulation operated in Europe and elsewhere;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether they are comparable to conditions in the UK and whether there are lessons that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might be learnt and applied. It is important to start by noting that, while there may be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">similarities between systems of press regulation, no two systems are the same and there are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important differences.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">While all of those countries in consideration here operate systems of self-regulation, they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">differ from the PCC in many ways. In some cases, notably Denmark, Sweden, Finland and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Germany, there is some form of involvement by government, either through statute or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because of financial support; in the case of France, the impact of legislation is very different</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the model in the UK and has real impacts upon the functioning of the press in that country.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Most of the comparative European countries operate a form of self-regulation through a Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council, but also in some cases a Press Ombudsman (notably in Sweden). Unsurprisingly, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">majority of the Press Councils operating in Europe and internationally, have been established</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">solely with the printed press in mind. The development of new media, such as online</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publications and micro-blogging sites, have created opportunities for Press Councils to review</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">existing frameworks, in order to consider options for incorporating new media platforms into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their regulatory structure. This has included consideration of how to encourage membership,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as well as how to meet the expectations for new media platforms and additional sources of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">funding for the system of regulation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref69" href="#footnote69">69</a></sup> By way of example, Denmark operates a &#8216;polluter pays&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">policy for online members who have joined the Press Council. However, this is regarded as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">temporary measure, as no official funding mechanism has yet been developed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref70" href="#footnote70">70</a></sup> Online and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the self-regulatory settlement with online publishers is considered as and where appropriate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in this section.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This section will also look at the composition of the Press Council Boards, as well as sources of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">funding for the industry; both are important variables. The German Press Council for example</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is co-funded by the German Government. This system has not led to statutory regulation;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">neither has it been suggested that the Government exerts a deleterious influence simply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because of the public funding. In her extremely well informed evidence to the Inquiry, Lara</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Fielden, a Visiting Fellow at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, has suggested</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, although many of the European Press Councils profess to focus on the embedding and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">maintenance of journalistic standards, in practice this role is limited and most Press Councils</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are reactive and complaints driven instead.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref71" href="#footnote71">71</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I will first consider the Scandinavian countries and thereafter Germany, France and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Netherlands. I will then pass on briefly to review the situation in both the United States and</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">China.</span>

 <h3>Denmark, Sweden and Finland</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The press in the Scandinavian countries has been described as a collective press which has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">historically prided itself on the publication of information to high standards of accuracy, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within the boundaries set by a clear journalistic code. In each of the Scandinavian countries,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the respective Press Council has powers to raise monetary contributions and, if an article</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is found to breach the code, to mandate the publication of the fact of a breach along with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an apology. Furthermore, in Denmark, the Press Council additionally has the ability (rarely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">used) to fine or imprison an editor-in-chief who fails to comply with a publication of a Council</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adjudication.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref72" href="#footnote72">72</a></sup> As to the relevance of rights of individuals, the Swedish Code of Standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">includes the clause that journalists should:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref73" href="#footnote73">73</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Refrain from publicity which could violate the privacy of individuals, unless the public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interest obviously demands public scrutiny&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Fielden explained that the tabloid press in the Scandinavian countries had become</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">increasingly comfortable with reporting on the private lives of politicians and others.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref74" href="#footnote74">74</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Significantly, there are no press laws in place, nor specific legislation relating to the regulation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the printed press, in Denmark, Sweden or Finland. However, contrary to assertions made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in evidence and in public over the course of this Inquiry, there are elements of governmental</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involvement that can be found in the systems of press self-regulation operated in these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Scandinaviancountries.Forexample,andmostnotably,theDanishPressCouncilisestablished</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in statute, pursuant to the Danish Media Liability Act 1998, albeit that other elements of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system are self-regulatory particularly in terms of handling adjudications, the composition of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Press Council Board and the exercise of Council responsibilities. Under the terms of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Act, all publications which are in printed circulation more than twice a year, as well as holders</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of broadcast licences, are subject to regulation by the Danish Press Council. The Council also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deals with complaints across all media platforms, including online media, provided (in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case of online publishers) that these organisations are registered with the Council.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the self-regulatory system in Denmark, Sweden and Finland. The procedure of registering an</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Any journalist, or individual who imparts news in some way, whether through printed media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or online, is protected under the Danish Press Council&#8217;s professional umbrella. The benefits</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of membership of the Council include access to privileges in law such as the protection of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the online presence of a broadcaster or a printed newspaper). However, purely online-only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">outlets are not expected to contribute. This is partly due to the non-existence of a funding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mechanism and is compensated by the Danish Press Council operating the &#8216;polluter pays&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">policy, which is applied if an online member breaches the Code.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref77" href="#footnote77">77</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is noteworthy that, in similar fashion to the PCC, the Danish Press Council does not accept</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">third party complaints and deals with only those individuals who have been directly affected</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by press misreporting.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One of the primary roles of the Danish Press Council is the duty to enforce a right of reply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(albeit limited to specific factual inaccuracy). This power is enacted in statute under the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Danish Media Liability Act 1998, and is procedurally different to the remedy obtainable from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the court,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref78" href="#footnote78">78</a></sup> and applies to both newspapers and broadcasters.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref79" href="#footnote79">79</a></sup> Save for this and for the penal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consequences visited on the editor-in-chief for failure to publish adjudications by the Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council, there are no other enforceable rights under the Act. Like the Press Councils in Sweden</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Finland, the Danish Press Council does not have the power to award compensation or to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impose financial penalties.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-12"><a href="#para2-12" name="para2-12">2.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although the Danish Press Council is set up in statute, it is still at a fundamental level self-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory and is regarded as such by its members. The eight members of the Council are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appointedfortheirindustryexpertise.Historically,amemberoftheDanishSupremeCourthas</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">always been appointed as the Chair of the Council and a lawyer has held the position of Vice-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chair. The remainder of the Council consists of industry members, who are either journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or editorial management, or independent public members; each is equally represented with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">two positions on the panel.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although the system operated in Denmark has its benefits, it has come under parliamentary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scrutiny, in particular for the placement of apologies and corrections.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref80" href="#footnote80">80</a></sup> According to Ms</span>

<h4>Sweden</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-14"><a href="#para2-14" name="para2-14">2.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In Sweden, the press and press freedom are specifically protected by two of Sweden&#8217;s four</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">constitutional laws. These function to protect the freedom of speech (Freedom of the Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Act 1991) and the freedom of the Swedish press (Freedom of the Press Act 1949). These</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">freedoms apply to any individual who has registered for authorisation to publish and can</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">include private individuals such as online bloggers. Both Acts guarantee a ban on censorship,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the protection for anonymous sources and the right of public access to documents held by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Swedish authorities.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref82" href="#footnote82">82</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press standards in Sweden are upheld through the Swedish Press Council. Membership is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voluntaryand notbackedbylegislation,unlikein Denmark.Newspapersand printpublications</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are authorised to publish as members of either the Swedish Newspaper Publishers&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Association, the Magazine Publishers&#8217; Association, the Swedish Union of Journalists, or the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">National Press Club. There are no restrictions on who can apply for a licence through the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Swedish Press Council. These organisations collectively finance the system of self-regulation,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and also set the Code of Ethics for the printed media (and broadcasting) in Sweden.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-16"><a href="#para2-16" name="para2-16">2.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In Sweden, the editor-in-chief of a print publication is legally responsible for all content</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">published by that title and is answerable to the Press Council Board. There are a total of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">18 members of the Press Council Board. In similar fashion to Denmark, the Chair and three</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Vice-Chairs are members of the Swedish Supreme Court. The remaining members are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">representatives from the four associations responsible for funding the Press Council, as well</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as three representatives of the general public who are without affiliation to the press. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">composition of the Board is seen as a way of underpinning the independence of the system</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of self-regulation in a country that has historically esteemed the freedom of the press and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sought to protect it in law.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref83" href="#footnote83">83</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-17"><a href="#para2-17" name="para2-17">2.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sweden also operates a Press Ombudsman whose role is to investigate complaints, provide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information and advice to the public and contribute to the development of press standards.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">BoththePressCouncilandtheOmbudsmandealwiththeonlineversionsofprintednewspapers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and magazines. The Press Ombudsman is the first point of contact for any complainant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who has a personal interest in press misreporting or who has been directly affected by it.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As such, third party complaints are not accepted by the Swedish Ombudsman. The Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ombudsman does not act as a mediator but rather makes decisions on whether a complaint</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can be accepted and passed to the Council for adjudication. If the Press Ombudsman decides</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a complaint does not warrant formal criticism of the title in question, the complainant can</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appeal directly to the Press Council. There are also no restrictions to prevent a complainant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from taking the grievance to court after it has been considered by the Press Ombudsman and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Press Council.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-18"><a href="#para2-18" name="para2-18">2.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Press Ombudsman is appointed by a special committee which consists of the Chief</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Chair of the Swedish Bar Association and the Chair of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">National Press Club. The length of time taken for an adjudication by the Press Council can be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a further six or seven months after the Ombudsman has considered a submitted complaint</span>

<p id="para-id-2-19"><a href="#para2-19" name="para2-19">2.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In contrast to the UK and Denmark, however, the Swedish Press Council operates a system</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whereby titles are expected to contribute towards costs after a breach of the code. Whereas</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only online operators in Denmark are ordered to pay a levy towards the funding of the Council</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if they are in breach of the code, in Sweden, anyone who breaches the code is required to pay</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a &#8216;penalty&#8217; towards the fund. It is estimated that this form of &#8216;polluter pays&#8217; policy contributes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approximately 20% of the Press Council&#8217;s funding.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref84" href="#footnote84">84</a></sup></span>
<h4>Finland</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-20"><a href="#para2-20" name="para2-20">2.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finland&#8217;s printed press is regulated by The Council for Mass Media (CMM), established by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publishers and journalists in 1968. It is the main body responsible for the self-regulation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Finland&#8217;s printed press and broadcasters. It is also the only self-regulatory system in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Scandinavian countries that encompasses all media platforms, including online journalism.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Under Finnish Law, the freedom of speech is protected through the Exercise of Freedom of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Expression in Mass Media Act 2003.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref85" href="#footnote85">85</a></sup> Through this Act, publications are obliged to provide a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public right of reply as well as the duty to correct factual inaccuracies. In similar requirements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Sweden, each publication must nominate an editor who holds the responsibility for all the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">published content of that publication.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-21"><a href="#para2-21" name="para2-21">2.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The CMM is responsible for issuing Guidelines for Journalists, which establishes professional</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conduct guidelines across cross-media platforms. Membership to the CMM is voluntary,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although it is perhaps noteworthy that journalists who have affiliated membership to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">CouncilcommitthemselvestoadvancingandupholdingtheprinciplessetoutintheGuidelines</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for Journalists. Dr Riitta Ollila, a member of the CMM has argued that the Council:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref86" href="#footnote86">86</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;does not act as a mediator between editors and audience but as a master of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">code making remarks on the press of their errors.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although the CMM has no legal jurisdiction over the regulation of the press, its position</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">overseeing journalistic standards is generally accepted. The CMM receives state funding from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Finnish Government equivalent to 30% of the Council&#8217;s budget.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-22"><a href="#para2-22" name="para2-22">2.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In contrast to Denmark, Sweden and indeed effective practice in the UK, the CMM is open</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to third party complainants. Complaints can be received from any member of public who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considers that there has been a breach of good practice or violation of the Guidelines for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Journalists. Any title or broadcaster found in breach of good practice is compelled by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">CMM to publish a notice issued by the Council within a certain timeframe. Similarly to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC, the CMM will not rule on an issue or consider a complaint where legal action is being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken concurrently. The Council can only rule on complaints brought to the Council&#8217;s attention</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within three months of publication.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-23"><a href="#para2-23" name="para2-23">2.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The CMM is comprised of eight representatives of the industry and (including the Chair)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">four public members. Up until 2007, only a current or serving media professional could be</span>

<p id="para-id-2-24"><a href="#para2-24" name="para2-24">2.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The membership of Press Councils in Scandinavia has historically been high; it appears that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this is largely due to the reputational benefits of membership and the accountability that is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perceived to be afforded by membership of the relevant Council. This is also shown through</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the increasingly high rate of membership by online media outlets, and the online platforms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of traditional media. In addition, it appears to be the case that, in the Scandinavian countries,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thereis acultureofcommitmentto(andindeedpridein)highjournalisticstandards.Therefore</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the question of membership, irrespective of the cost of that membership to an individual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication, is not an issue for consideration by media bodies in Scandinavia. As has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">noted, the only exception is Denmark, where any publication that meets the criteria defined</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the Media Liability Act, is subjected to compulsory regulation by the Danish Press Council.</span>

<h3>Germany</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-25"><a href="#para2-25" name="para2-25">2.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It has been argued by some commentators that the German Press Council operates the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">purest form of press self-regulation in Europe. In Germany, the press are regulated only by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press and are only subject to restrictions within the German Basic Law (<span style="font-style:italic"> Grundgesetz</span> ). The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press Council was established in 1956 and consists of members from industry organisations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the press trade unions. The Council has 28 industry members and the Chairmanship of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Council rotates between the representatives of the different industry organisations. Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behaviour and standards are set out in the German Press Code, first developed by the Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council in 1973, which provides guidelines under which journalists should operate. In 2009,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Press Council expanded their remit to include online newspapers. The Press Council relies</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on Government funding for its operations (although there is a stipulation that the funding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should not exceed 49% of the Press Council&#8217;s total revenue).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref88" href="#footnote88">88</a></sup> Other than providing monetary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">support to the Council, the Government has no powers or influence over the day-to-day</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operations of the Council.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-26"><a href="#para2-26" name="para2-26">2.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Any member of the general public may make a complaint directly to the Council. Complainants</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">do not have to waive their rights to initiate legal proceedings if they submit a complaint to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press Council. If the Press Council Board supports a public complaint, then the newspaper in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question is expected to publish the Press Council&#8217;s ruling. This public reprimand is a voluntary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undertaking by the title in breach, rather than an order dictated by law or mandated as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">condition of membership of the Council. Ms Fielden has noted that some 90% of German</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publishers have signed up to the voluntary undertaking, although one major publisher, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Bauer Media Group,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref89" href="#footnote89">89</a></sup> has not renewed its declaration.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref90" href="#footnote90">90</a></sup> Whilst the Press Council can request</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that these reprimands are published, as with the PCC, it cannot determine the prominence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given to the publication of the decision.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">ongoing and has led to delays in the publication of apologies. This has led to the reputation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the German Press Council being discredited and has damaged the public perception of its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">general credibility as a self-regulating body.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-28"><a href="#para2-28" name="para2-28">2.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The approach of the German press is perhaps more aggressive than that in Scandinavia,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although it may appear tame in comparison to standards in the UK. Its behaviour has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described best as a<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;balancing</span><span style="font-style:italic"> act&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref92" href="#footnote92">92</a></sup> Significantly, there is a culture in the German press</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">respect, Bildblog is an example of an online media watchdog, which was originally established</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to examine the coverage by the Bild newspaper.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref93" href="#footnote93">93</a></sup> Bild has also been criticised by its readers,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">notably for its coverage in 2010 of a number of deaths at a music festival in Duisburg.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref94" href="#footnote94">94</a></sup> The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">title was accused of exaggerating reports of the deaths and came under intense scrutiny from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public and industry members alike. The German Press Council received a large number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of complaints from readers, via traditional methods such as letters to the editor, as well as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">micro-blogging through channels such as Twitter. It has been argued that this event, and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resultant response, has led journalists to reflect on their standards of reporting for the future.</span>

<h3>France</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-29"><a href="#para2-29" name="para2-29">2.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The system of press regulation in France is different to the countries so far outlined. In place</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a Press Council, the press in France are regulated by the existing body of French law.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Trade unions and professional associations, such as the Syndicat National des Journalistes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the Association des Journalistes R&#233;publicains Francais, are responsible for maintaining</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards of journalism across the printed press. As a consequence, the development of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">code of standards applicable to the industry has been problematic. Instead, both the Unions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and professional associations have encouraged the appointment of ombudsmen at some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper titles. The first appeared in 1994 at Le Monde, although this has not been popular</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">across the majority of the printed press.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-30"><a href="#para2-30" name="para2-30">2.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Direction du D&#233;partment des M&#233;dias et des Industries Culturelles,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref95" href="#footnote95">95</a></sup> is responsible for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">development of Government policy in relation to the media and plurality. It is also responsible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for providing financial support to parts of the media, most of which is directed towards the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">printed press.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-31"><a href="#para2-31" name="para2-31">2.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Efforts at creating a Press Council in France have been unsuccessful. The most recent attempt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in 2006 led to the establishment of the Association de prefiguration d&#8217;un Conseil de press,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref96" href="#footnote96">96</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">led by a group of French journalists, although it is unclear how far their efforts have led.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref97" href="#footnote97">97</a></sup> It is</span>

 <p id="para-id-2-32"><a href="#para2-32" name="para2-32">2.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The corollary to the informal systems of self-regulation in France is the application of civil</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and criminal law. Although the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech are both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">constitutional principles, uniquely in Europe, privacy laws, in particular Article 9 of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Civil Code,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref98" href="#footnote98">98</a></sup> are also applicable to the press. Intrusions into privacy, including the taking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of photographs of individuals in a public place, are prohibited. Article 9 guarantees the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protection of the citizen&#8217;s private life, from which the right to one&#8217;s image emanates. The Civil</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Code, however, is fluid in definition in relation to individuals who have a public profile and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in particular, those who hold public office. Under the constitutional guarantees of freedom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of speech, French law allows for the publication of information on individuals in public office,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a consequence of their occupation or status. They are presumed to waive rights over the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication of their image, on condition that it is used to inform and not for commercial gain.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In French civil law, an individual who feels that their image has been misused can request court</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">action to prevent the attack (through detention, seizure of property, banning the publication,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or public denunciation) or seek damages in compensation. In criminal law, invasion of one&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privacy is punishable by a prison term of up to 12 months and a fine of up to &#8364;45,000.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-33"><a href="#para2-33" name="para2-33">2.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Historically, the French press has been reluctant to publish stories on the private lives of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals. Perhaps the most famous example of this phenomenon was the refusal of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the French press to publish stories about the extramarital affairs of the former President,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Fran&#231;ois Mitterrand. Suffice to say that nothing was printed about President Mitterrand&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">second family, and it was only shortly before his death that the press revealed the facts.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There has been a historical willingness to interpret privacy law broadly (and some may argue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">too broadly) and it has been argued that French privacy law is used to suppress information.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, increasingly French newspapers and, particularly, celebrity gossip magazines are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">challenging this traditional reluctance to publish content that may be regarded as private and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such stories are increasingly the norm in France. The recent publication of the photographs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Duchess of Cambridge may be part of this trend.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref99" href="#footnote99">99</a></sup></span>
<h3>Netherlands</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-34"><a href="#para2-34" name="para2-34">2.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Freedom of speech is set out in Article 7 of the Constitution of the Netherlands. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Constitution also states that the Government has a duty to enable the media to freely exercise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their profession without any form of undue influence or interference. This is realised through</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Dutch Media Act 2008. Although the Act regulates only public broadcasters and cable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operators in the Netherlands, it also ensures that newspapers and internet publications have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rights to operate independently and free from Government interference.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref100" href="#footnote100">100</a></sup><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref101" href="#footnote101">101</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Union of Journalists founded the prototype of a Dutch Press Council in 1948; this functioned</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">Netherlands Press Council (NPC), in 1960.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref102" href="#footnote102">102</a></sup> This Council describes journalism in the country</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a completely free profession, where any individual can be considered a journalist and is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not required to be professionally registered as such.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-36"><a href="#para2-36" name="para2-36">2.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The NPC does not accept third party complaints. Complaints are only accepted from those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who have a direct interest and are affected by the issue and must also be related to a specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breach of the Code. It must concern the journalistic practice of either a professional journalist</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or someone who, on a regular basis and for remuneration, collaborates on the editorial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">content of a mass medium. The Council can only pass judgment and is unable to impose</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sanctions on titles in breach of appropriate journalistic practice. In the Netherlands, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">much like the UK, a complainant&#8217;s route to seeking compensation is through civil litigation.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-37"><a href="#para2-37" name="para2-37">2.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The fundamental difference between the system of press self-regulation operated in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Netherlands through the NPC and the PCC lies in the prominence accorded to publication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of adjudications against titles in breach of the Netherlands guidelines for journalism. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adjudicationsummariespublishedbytheNPCnameandshamejournalistswhohavebreached</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terms on accuracy, or have been found to have crossed the limits of what it is acceptable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to publish. These adjudications are published in full on the Press Council&#8217;s website, as well</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as in the Dutch union of journalists&#8217; newspaper, which is widely read by people working in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the industry. The decisions are also widely circulated through national news agencies and to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other media organisations. This very public naming of titles in breach of the code is seen as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deterrent for poor journalistic behaviour.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-38"><a href="#para2-38" name="para2-38">2.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although the NPC cannot force a title to publish a correction, the majority of the media will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">respect such a request from the Council and will comply. Some titles have decided not to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publish the verdicts of complaints against them, such as De Telegraaf (the largest newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the country) and NOVA, a current affairs programme on television, who announced that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they would no longer cooperate with the NPC. Despite this, 80% of the NPC members have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indicated that they would publish adjudications involving their titles.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-39"><a href="#para2-39" name="para2-39">2.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Chair of the Dutch Press Council has historically been appointed from the Dutch Judiciary.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Chair is assisted by three Vice-Chairs, who are also drawn from the law. The remaining</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">members of the Council comprise 13 industry members (including journalists) and 13 lay</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">members.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref103" href="#footnote103">103</a></sup> In recent years, steps have been taken to improve the effectiveness of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council, including an internal review of systems and functions. Changes have included the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appointment of five &#8216;public members&#8217; drawn from the Dutch public at large.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref104" href="#footnote104">104</a></sup> In order to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">implement improvements, the NPC has applied for additional financial support from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dutch Government and has pushed for the adoption of a similar funding mechanism to that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">used in Germany. The review of systems and functions conducted by the NPC also considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other self regulatory models, including the PCC.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In some countries there are no systems of press regulation. The prime and only statutory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">structure of the United States print newspaper industry is the First Amendment to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">American Constitution, adopted in 1791.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref106" href="#footnote106">106</a></sup> The First Amendment to the Constitution reads:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref107" href="#footnote107">107</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">redress of grievances.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The First Amendment protects both the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although there remain certain statutory limitations relating to defamation and privacy,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref108" href="#footnote108">108</a></sup> as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">well as certain forms of state censorship, which exempt some areas of free speech from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protections of the First Amendment.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref109" href="#footnote109">109</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-42"><a href="#para2-42" name="para2-42">2.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By way of example, there are restrictions in both Federal and State law in relation to obscene</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">images (which may be defined to cover material which would not be considered to offend</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obscenity laws in the UK); there is no equivalent to Page 3. Many US states seek to build on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the existing Federal law and place restrictions on the possession, dissemination and sale of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obscene material in public places, in particular those where minors may be present such as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">schools and libraries.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">institution recognised by the Chinese Communist Party or the government.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref111" href="#footnote111">111</a></sup> The managing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">institution is responsible for the exercise of control over the publication and content published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by it. Specifically, the managing institution should limit any negative coverage of the Chinese</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government and the Chinese Communist Party. There are, by definition and in fact, no free</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or independent media outlets in China.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-46"><a href="#para2-46" name="para2-46">2.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The regulation of the Chinese media by the government is not limited only to the domestic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">market. Indeed, the Chinese Government seeks to control the content of Chinese language</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers published abroad. The Epoch Times is a Chinese newspaper founded in 2000</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operated from the UK; it provides an interesting perspective on the reach of Chinese press</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Communist Party extends to the Chinese language print media in the UK and that this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">influence is exercised through the Chinese Embassy. They have said that the Embassy seeks</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to influence media outlets targeted at the Chinese community and has sought to discourage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its circulation. The Director of the English edition, Sek Halu, has suggested that a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">retailers and supermarkets have refused to stock the Epoch Times because of its critical view</span>

 <h3>Australian Independent Media Inquiry: the Finkelstein Report</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Independent Media Inquiry was established by the Australian Government on 14</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">September 2011. A former Justice of the Federal Court of Australia, Mr Ray Finkelstein QC,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was appointed to conduct the Inquiry. The Independent Media Inquiry invited submissions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from any person with an interest in the issue and held public hearings in Melbourne, Sydney</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Perth during November and December 2011. In parallel to these hearings, the Chair</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Inquiry also invited selected individuals, organisations, trade associations and other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interested parties to make formal submissions. Responses were received from a range of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parties, including serving editors of Australia&#8217;s major media outlets, former editors with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">experience of the news media industry, the current Chair of the Australian Press Council (as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">well as former Chairs), and academics specialising in media and regulation.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The timing of the Independent Media Inquiry has overlapped with the establishment of this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry. Although the former was not set up in response to any allegations of wrongdoing at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News Limited (the Australian subsidiary of News Corp), or to investigate any press misconduct,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was nevertheless indirectly provoked by the allegations of phone hacking and corrupt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">payments at News International that led to this Inquiry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref114" href="#footnote114">114</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Terms of Reference for the Independent Media Inquiry focussed on the efficacy of existing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">codes of conduct governing media practice in Australia, particularly the likely impact on these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the growing convergence of print media and digital and online platforms. Mr Finkelstein</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was also required to investigate:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref115" href="#footnote115">115</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The impact of this technological change on the business model that has supported</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the investment by traditional media organisations in quality journalism and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">production of news, and how such activities can be supported, and diversity enhanced,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the changed media environment; ways of substantially strengthening the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">independence and effectiveness of the Australian Press Council, including in relation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to online publications, and with particular reference to the handling of complaints;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and any related issues pertaining to the ability of the media to operate according to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regulations and codes of practice, and in the public interest.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Independent Media Inquiry concluded its review and reported to the Australian</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government on 28 February 2012. Mr Finkelstein recommended that the current Australian</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press Council (APC) should be replaced by an independent body, the News Media Council</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(NMC).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref116" href="#footnote116">116</a></sup> The role of the NMC would be to ensure that Australian news media operated in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more accountable manner to those who were the subject of press reporting, as well as to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">general public at large. To enable the NMC to exercise this function, Mr Finkelstein argued</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the NMC should have strengthened remedial powers to deal with complaints about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press. These proposed powers would be significantly greater than those available to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">existing APC. Mr Finkelstein also proposed that the NMC should have powers to enforce a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">right of reply, the withdrawal of an article from further circulation, and the publication of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apologies and Council adjudications (including the ability to control the size and prominence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of these publications). These remedial powers are, according to Mr Finkelstein, necessary to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">preserve the integrity of the press.</span>

 <p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The NMC would also be responsible for setting journalistic standards, in consultation with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry, and to handle complaints across all media platforms (specifically print, online, radio</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and television). Mr Finkelstein proposed a greater level of funding from the Government for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the body which would replace the current levy system. He argued that this would remove a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">current burden on the print industry but would also address the issue of the independence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the NMC from the industry.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Perhaps more significantly, and indeed a change of greater significance, Mr Finkelstein also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposed that a legal requirement should be established to grant powers to the NMC to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">take legal action against any media outlet that refused to comply with the requirements set</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the NMC. By way of example, if a publication refused to publish an adjudication issued</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the NMC, the Council or the complainant would have the right to apply for a court order</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compelling compliance from the publication. Any failure by the publication to comply with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the court order would be subject to existing legal processes. It is this particular aspect of Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finkelstein&#8217;s proposals that has been the subject of considerable and heated media criticism.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his concluding remarks, Mr Finkelstein drew comparisons between his review and this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry. He acknowledged that, although the Independent Media Inquiry was not established</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in response to phone hacking in Australia, they shared the historical experience of a Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council that had limited powers as a self-regulatory body and was unable to fully bring the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press to account in the public eye. Mr Finkelstein has also speculated, in relation to this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry, that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref117" href="#footnote117">117</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Looking at the matter from afar, it would not be surprising if statutory regulation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were top of the list.&#8221;</span>
<h4>Public and Industry Response to the Finkelstein Report</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-10"><a href="#para3-10" name="para3-10">3.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It would be an understatement to observe that Mr Finkelstein&#8217;s recommendations have not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gone unchallenged by the Australian press. Rather, the Report has led to a wide-ranging and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at times, heated debate as to the nature of press freedom in Australia.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref118" href="#footnote118">118</a></sup> News Limited&#8217;s Chief</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Executive, Kim Williams, called the Independent Media Inquiry&#8217;s report &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> too</span><span style="font-style:italic"> draconian</span> &#8221; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argued that there was little value in replacing the existing Australian Press Council (APC) with</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;the most outrageous assault on our democracy in the history of the media.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-12"><a href="#para3-12" name="para3-12">3.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A different perspective was provided by the Chair of the current APC, Professor Julian Disney,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who has continued to argue for the improvement of resources available to the APC to ensure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it was able to fulfil its complaints-handling responsibilities. He stated that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref122" href="#footnote122">122</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;resources are hopelessly inadequate and they were even before our number of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">complaints doubled so it is really just to carry out the responsibilities that we are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">meant to have and that people expect us to do.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-13"><a href="#para3-13" name="para3-13">3.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In this respect, Professor Disney agreed with many of the central recommendations of Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finkelstein&#8217;s report which, he suggested, clearly identified the fundamental flaws in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">current system of complaints handling through the APC. However, Professor Disney has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strongly disagreed with the two particular elements of Mr Finkelstein&#8217;s proposals.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref123" href="#footnote123">123</a></sup> He also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">drew attention to the absence of any coverage by local newspapers of the APC&#8217;s opinions of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Finkelstein&#8217;s report.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref124" href="#footnote124">124</a></sup> He stated that no Sydney or Melbourne paper had reported the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">views of the APC, despite the body being the main focus of the report, or their response to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the proposals. He argued that this was a striking example of the lack of balanced coverage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that existed in the Australian press.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-14"><a href="#para3-14" name="para3-14">3.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Some commentators have chosen not to focus on the detail of the proposals but have instead</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered how the recommendations might be applied in practice, particularly as that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finkelstein concluded the NMC should not be established by statute. Echoing the views of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of Australian commentators, the former financial journalist Jim Parker, who currently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">writes for the respected Australian media blog, The Failed Estate,125 argued that, without a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statutory backdrop, the powers of the proposed NMC would be without effect.126</span>
<h3>Australian Convergence Review</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-15"><a href="#para3-15" name="para3-15">3.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Convergence Review was established in early 2011 by the Australian Government to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examine the current system of media regulation in the light of the challenges posed by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conversion of services and the proliferation of media platforms. Specifically, the Convergence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Review sought to establish whether a single model could be applied across the media.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-16"><a href="#para3-16" name="para3-16">3.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This review was led by the Convergence Review Committee, chaired by Glen Boreham, former</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">with looking at how the recommendations of Mr Finkelstein&#8217;s Independent Media Inquiry</span>

<p id="para-id-3-18"><a href="#para3-18" name="para3-18">3.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In this regard, the Convergence Review recommended that thresholds should be defined in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to the annual revenue of a concern, as well as the number of readers (or &#8216;hits&#8217;) any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media title attracts within the Australian market.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref131" href="#footnote131">131</a></sup> By setting these thresholds, Australia&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">15 largest media companies would be subject to regulation by the new body. Ms Fielden</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">noted in her evidence to the Inquiry that online operator, Google, would be exempt from this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">definition, despite the company&#8217;s reach within the Australian media market. This was due to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the stipulation that saw Google&#8217;s revenue understood in terms of professionally produced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material, rather than as a content service enterprise.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref132" href="#footnote132">132</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-19"><a href="#para3-19" name="para3-19">3.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Committee&#8217;s proposals did not, however, take forward the recommendation of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Independent Media Inquiry to establish the new News Media Council. Rather, it proposed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an industry-led body for maintaining news standards across all media and communications,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the stead of the Government-appointed regulator proposed by Mr Finkelstein. This was in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">addition to the recommendation for a statutory regulator to replace the ACMA.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-20"><a href="#para3-20" name="para3-20">3.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At the time of writing, the Australian Government was still considering the recommendations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of both Committees. However, whatever the eventual Government response, it will no doubt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">alter the regulatory landscape of Australia in relation to the convergence of print, broadcast</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and online media.</span>
<h4>Public and Industry Response to the Convergence Review</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-21"><a href="#para3-21" name="para3-21">3.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There has been a mixed response from the industry to the recommendations of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Convergence Review. Although these recommendations have not generated the same levels</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of controversy and debate as those put forward by Mr Finkelstein, a number of commentators</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">saw the proposals as part of a continued, and in some cases deliberate, erosion of the freedom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref133" href="#footnote133">133</a></sup> In her evidence, Ms Fielden drew the attention of the Inquiry to the response</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of some parts of the Australian press, which have argued that the Convergence Review was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">purposefully established in order to regulate the fifteen companies which would fall under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the definition of &#8216;content service enterprises&#8217;, and has been otherwise unconcerned with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other areas of media regulation that ought to have been considered more fully by the review.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Fielden disputed the validity of this assessment of the Convergence Review.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref134" href="#footnote134">134</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Fielden also told the Inquiry of the recent changes implemented to improve the function</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and practice of the Australian Press Council (APC), introduced in response both to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Convergence Review and the allegations of wrongdoing, in particular the allegations of phone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking that led to the establishment of this Inquiry. She said that the Council had actively</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responded to the calls for reform of press regulation, and had proactively sought to consult</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Australian public in order to determine how best to hold the press to account. This had led</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the APC consciously to shift its focus of activity to the maintenance and improvement of press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards, ensuring the fair balance of the Journalists&#8217; Code and the mediation of complaints.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The APC had appointed an advisory board tasked with monitoring the coverage by news</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media of issues which were likely to give rise to a substantial number of complaints.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref135" href="#footnote135">135</a></sup></span>

<h3>New Zealand Law Commission Review</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-23"><a href="#para3-23" name="para3-23">3.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The New Zealand Law Commission Review examined the legal and regulatory environment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in which the media operated in New Zealand and, specifically, the privileges that existed for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">print media and whether these should be extended to their online equivalents. Such privileges</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">included legal rights to the protection of sources and others relating to court proceedings.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Review tried to set a framework which defined who should benefit from these privileges</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and how. The Terms of Reference were to examine the following questions:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref136" href="#footnote136">136</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;how to define &#8216;news media&#8217; for the purposes of the law; whether, and to what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">extent, the jurisdiction of the Broadcasting Standards Authority and/or the Press</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Council should be extended to cover currently unregulated news media and, if so,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what legislative changes would be required to achieve this end, and; whether the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">existing criminal and civil remedies for wrongs such as defamation, harassment,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">breach of confidence and privacy are effective in the new media environment and, if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not, whether alternative remedies may be available.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-24"><a href="#para3-24" name="para3-24">3.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The New Zealand Law Commission provided a list of preliminary proposals, published in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">December 2011, and has since invited submissions in relation to these proposals. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposals included the suggestion for a statutory definition of &#8216;news media&#8217; (to include new</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media), specifically for the purposes of defining which publications should be entitled to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rights of the legal privileges and exemptions. The Review also proposed the establishment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a new independent regulator, responsible for all news media, regardless of the format or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">delivery platform. In relation to the existing civil remedies for victims of mistreatment by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press or other media, the Review proposed the creation of a Communications Tribunal, which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would handle complaints in the context of the changing publishing environment.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-25"><a href="#para3-25" name="para3-25">3.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Law Commission&#8217;s preliminary Report was published to encourage wider public debate,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as well as to generate feedback on the scale and scope of initial solutions. By way of example,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Law Commission produced two options, for consideration by the public and stakeholders,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as to whether membership of the new body should be enforced by statute or remain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voluntary. The consultation period ran from December 2011 to March 2012.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref137" href="#footnote137">137</a></sup> The paper and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accompanying proposals are currently being considered by the New Zealand Government</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which, similarly to the Australian Convergence Review, is due to report in Autumn 2012.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref138" href="#footnote138">138</a></sup></span>

 <h3>Concluding remarks</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-26"><a href="#para3-26" name="para3-26">3.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The alternative models of press regulation, as well as the other recent international reviews,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have provided helpful examples of the different possible solutions for this Inquiry to consider.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is possible, however, to argue that there has been no compelling evidence to demonstrate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that any of these models, or combinations of them, would function better than any others.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-27"><a href="#para3-27" name="para3-27">3.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is clear, however, that all the structures considered in this Chapter are embedded in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">social, cultural and historical functions of the media in each country, and are not necessarily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ideal structures to apply to the UK. It is also worth noting how many countries are currently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considering the impact of the evolution of digital platforms, as we have seen in Scandinavia</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and further afield in Australia and New Zealand. This development of online media content,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as well as methods of delivery, has brought the regulation of print media into a whole</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">new context. Although some of the practices revealed by the Inquiry may not be faced by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other countries, the overarching questions being addressed are not unique; but neither is it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">possible to pretend that any other system, inquiry or review has successfully developed an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ideal solution to the problems being faced.</span>
