<h1>CHAPTER 1<br/>CRITERIA FOR A REGULATORY SOLUTION</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In order to make recommendations for a new more effective regulatory regime, as required by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Terms of Reference of the Inquiry, it is essential first to consider what a regulatory regime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be seeking to achieve. There are three aspects to this question: first, what a regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regime should do; second, how it should be structured to achieve that; and third, the detailed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rules that are put in place to achieve the objectives. The &#8216;what&#8217; is about outcomes and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;how&#8217; is about processes, structures and accountabilities. The detailed rules should be dealt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with in the substance of any code or regulations. These three aspects of a regulatory regime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">need to be considered separately as they are not necessarily dependent on each other and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it may be possible to achieve the desired objectives by different combinations of solutions.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This chapter is specifically about the &#8216;what&#8217;. In May 2012 I published on the Inquiry website</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a set of draft criteria for a regulatory solution that aimed to set out what any regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">solution should seek to achieve. This was not concerned with how those outcomes should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be achieved, or the structures through which they should be achieved, but simply what the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">outcomes should be. Those draft criteria were:</span>

<blockquote>

<h5>1.  Effectiveness</h5></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">1.1  Any solution must be perceived as effective and credible both by the press as an </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">industry and by the public:</span></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">

<li>(a) It must strike a balance, capable of being accepted as reasonable, legitimate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and in the public interest by all.</span>
<li>It must recognise the importance for the public interest of a free press in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a democracy, freedom of expression and investigative journalism, the rule</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of law, personal privacy and other private rights, and a press which acts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibly and in the public interest.</span>
<li>It must promote a clear understanding of &#8216;the public interest&#8217; which would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accepted as reasonable by press, industry and public alike.</span>
<li>It must be durable and sufficiently flexible to work for future markets and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">technology, and be capable of universal application.</span>

</ol>

<h5>2.  Fairness and objectivity of Standards</h5>
<p>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">2.1  There must be a statement of ethical standards which is recognised as reasonable </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">by the industry and credible by the public. This statement must identify enforceable </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">minimum standards as well as articulating good practice that should be aimed for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">2.2  All  standards  for  good  practice  in  journalism  should  be  driven  by  the  public </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">interest and must be benchmarked in a clear objective way to the public interest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">2.3  The setting of standards must be independent of government and parliament, </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">and sufficiently independent of media interests, in order to command public respect.</span></p>
<h5>3.  Independence and transparency of enforcement and compliance</h5>
<p><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">3.1  Enforcement of ethical standards, by whatever mechanism, must be operationally </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">independent of government and parliament, and sufficiently independent of media </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">interests, in order to command public respect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">3.2  In particular all relevant appointments processes must be sufficiently independent </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">of government, Parliament and media interests to command public support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">3.3  Compliance  must  be  the  responsibility  of  editors  and  transparent  and </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">demonstrable to the public.</span></p>
<h5>4.  Powers and remedies</h5>
<p><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">4.1  The  system  must  provide  credible  remedies,  both  in  respect  of  aggrieved </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">individuals and in respect of issues affecting wider groups in society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">4.2  The regulatory regime must have effective investigatory and advisory powers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">4.3  The system should also actively support and promote compliance by the industry, </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">both  directly  (for  example  by  providing  confidential  pre-publication  advice)  and </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">indirectly (for example by kitemarking titles&#8217; own internal systems).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">4.4  The  system  should  be  a  good  fit  with  other  relevant  regulatory  and  law </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enforcement functions.</span></p>
<h5>5.  Cost</h5>
<p><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">5.1  The  solution  must  be  sufficiently  reliably  financed  to  allow  for  reasonable </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">operational  independence  and  appropriate  scope,  but  without  placing  a </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">disproportionate burden on either the industry, complainants or the taxpayer.&#8221;</span></p>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I sought comments on these draft criteria. Most of those who have submitted evidence on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation have accepted the criteria without comment. Some, including Ofcom,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantive comments on the criteria, suggesting that further consideration was needed on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a number of areas. Where appropriate, I address these comments later in this Chapter. I am,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">however, satisfied that the broad categories are correct and they continue to form the basis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of what I would hope could be achieved through the recommendations set out later in this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">part of the Report.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. Effectiveness</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The ultimate test of any new regime is that it must work in practice, in terms of ensuring</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the press comply with agreed standards. But that simple statement itself begs three</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">questions. The first is what is meant by &#8216;ensuring&#8217;; the second, what is meant by &#8216;the press&#8217;;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the third is what is meant by &#8216;agreed standards&#8217;. I address all of these points in this section</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the report. The Inquiry has heard over and over again that aspects of the current PCC based</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regime may be good in principle but that they simply do not work in practice. The essential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">flaws of the current regime have been examined elsewhere.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> At one fundamental level, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">current &#8216;self-regulatory&#8217; regime has failed to achieve continued universal coverage of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">main national newspaper titles with the withdrawal of Northern and Shell. I do not consider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it is possible for a regime to be considered effective if a major national newspaper group</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can choose to sit outside it without consequences. This should not be a controversial view, as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it essentially echoes Lord Hunt&#8217;s opinion that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;the credibility of the new system could be fatally undermined if any genuinely big </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">fish seek to escape the net.&#8221;</span>

<a name="page1584"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Hunt went on to confirm that Northern and Shell would qualify as a &#8216;big fish&#8217; in this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> The very fact that the industry has sought to put forward what it believes to be a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">new and fundamentally different approach to self-regulation constitutes a clear recognition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the existing regime is no longer effective.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Other aspects of external regulation, including the criminal and the civil law, have significant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">structural weaknesses, as is more fully discussed elsewhere in the Report.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> An effective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory regime will need to take account of those shortcomings and find ways of rectifying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them or otherwise dealing with them as far as possible.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are a number of different aspects of effectiveness. Views on what constitutes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effectiveness vary, but the broad headings included within the draft criteria have not been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contested. The draft criteria indicated that, in order to be effective, a regulatory regime for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press must be accepted as credible both by the press and the public and this proposition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has not been seriously disputed by anyone. This does not mean that either the industry or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest groups should have a veto over the solution, but it is important that the regime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be grounded in an understanding of the industry, the law, the rights and freedoms of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both individuals and the press, and the public interest in its widest sense. A regime that fails</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to take any of those factors fully into account will fail to meet the expectations and needs of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The draft criteria set out a broad perspective on the public interest. As with the concept</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of effectiveness, there are many different aspects to the public interest in this context.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The public interest in the freedom of the press and freedom of expression, including the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest in a diverse and vibrant press, are the most obvious. Any regulatory regime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that compromised the freedom of the press to hold authority to account, or to investigate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wrongdoing by the powerful, would not qualify as effective according to any reasonable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">person&#8217;s definition of that term. The public interest in the rule of law is also important. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">law applies to journalists and the press as it applies to everybody else. This is not to say</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that journalists cannot sometimes break the law in the pursuit of public interest journalism,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but that does not override the general public interest in the rule of law: on the contrary,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it recognises that a clear countervailing public interest must be identified before the rule</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of law may yield. Finally, there is a public interest in the protection of the private rights of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals, including the right to privacy, which falls to be weighed in the balance against</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public interest in free speech. Providing this requisite balance is one of the most difficult</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">challenges for any regulatory regime.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has heard evidence that different editors weigh up these countervailing public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interests in different ways. That may not be unreasonable looking at individual cases alone, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from an enforcement perspective it is only fair for both the public and the press themselves</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that each relevant enforcement authority should be clear about the basis on which they will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reach such judgments. It also seems reasonable that, if there is to be a body adjudicating on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press or media standards, such a body should set out for the public and the industry some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">guidance on what might be meant by the public interest in this context. The PCC Code, as most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recently revised, sets out the following non-exhaustive definition of the public interest:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is no definition of the public interest as such, but the code does provide this:</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although these definitions, or examples, have a lot in common there are naturally some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">differences. Views have been advanced on each of them, but it is not for this Inquiry to draft a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">comprehensive working definition: this would be both an overly ambitious and inappropriate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exercise. However, given that this is the<span style="font-weight:bold"> public</span> interest, and that it must explicitly relate to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interests outside those of the media enterprise concerned, it must be reasonable to conclude</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that whatever interpretation of the public interest is to be used in a new regulatory regime, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be recognised, understood and accepted by both the media and the public.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally on the question of effectiveness, the criteria spoke of a durable solution, and one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficiently flexible to work in the future. It is, of course, the case that, as many witnesses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have told the Inquiry, the media market is changing. Rupert Murdoch predicted that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">printed press might coexist with online news sources for possibly 20 years, but he also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commented that others estimated that the print versions may not survive for more than five</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or ten years.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> Without needing to take a view on how long the printed press will survive, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is unquestionably the case that a large proportion of people now receive at least some of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their news and current affairs content, and their entertainment, from the internet. Ofcom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">estimated that 41% of people today use the internet for news and current affairs coverage,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">andthattheinternetaccountsfor21%ofnewsandcurrentaffairsconsumption;thiscompares</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with 53% of adults using a newspaper, but newspapers account for only 11% of news and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">current affairs consumption.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup> Furthermore, the trend towards online consumption is rising.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This makes it abundantly clear that, for a regulatory regime to be effective, it must be capable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of delivering any perceived benefits to online publication as much as to print.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has also received evidence that a single regulatory regime across all media would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be desirable.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup> The Inquiry has heard some evidence on the nature and effectiveness of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">existing statutory regulatory framework for broadcast media; but this has been largely for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">purposes of comparison with the regime currently in place for print and to learn any relevant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lessons. I have not sought to take evidence on the adequacy of the regime for the broadcast</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sector and, accordingly, it is not my intention to examine the fitness of that regulatory regime,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or to make any recommendations as to how the broadcast sector should be regulated.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom correctly commented that the published draft criteria did not mention membership.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The criteria aimed to set out what a new regulatory regime should achieve, not the means by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which it should be achieved. The draft criteria provide that a new solution should be &#8216;capable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of universal application&#8217;. My starting point, as set out above, is that any regime which did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the very least cover all major national newspapers and their online presence, would not be</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">disagreement has been about whether compelling or enticing is the best way to achieve the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">objective of committed participation, coupled with what have been described as principled</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns about the use of legislation to compel any part of the press to do anything. I have no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">doubt that committed participation by the whole of industry is fundamental to an effective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">new regime.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-12"><a href="#para2-12" name="para2-12">2.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">My conclusion is that Criteria 1 as originally drafted continues to reflect the essential elements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a new effective regime.</span>

<a name="section3"></a>
<h2>3. Fairness and objectivity of standards</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The draft Criteria set out three aspects of fairness and objectivity of standards which I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered were fitting attributes of a new regulatory regime. The first was that there should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be a statement of ethical standards which is recognised as reasonable by the industry and as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">credible by the public. This statement must identify enforceable minimum standards as well</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as articulating the good practice that should be targeted.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has not undertaken a full systematic examination of the existing Editors&#8217; Code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but it has identified some deficiencies that have been identified in evidence presented to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup> Many witnesses have maintained that it is a good Code; others have argued that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it has weaknesses. In this context I simply note that the current Editors&#8217; Code appears to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a mix of broad statements of principle (for example<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;the press, whilst free to be partisan, </span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> );</span><span style="font-style:normal"> specific</span><span style="font-style:normal"> requirements</span><span style="font-style:normal"> (for</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">should they pass such information to others&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> );</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> requirements</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> can</span><span style="font-style:normal"> sometimes</span><span style="font-style:normal"> be</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">likely to contribute to such identification unless there is adequate justification and they are </span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Professor Megone commented that a code of practice needs to be presented in the context</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the specific critical contribution that a free press can make to the public interest. Overall,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there is room for improvement of the current Code.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup></span>

<a name="page1588"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;All standards for good practice in journalism should be driven by the public interest </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">and must be benchmarked in a clear objective way to the public interest.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Associated News Limited (ANL) have raised a concern about this, stating that the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be free to publish material of their choice without always having to justify it on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">grounds of public interest. I accept entirely that the vast majority of material published in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">most newspapers and magazines will not infringe other peoples&#8217; rights or the law and has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no need to be justified on public interest, or any other, grounds. It was not the intention in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these draft criteria to suggest that all material in a newspaper should be able to pass a public</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">interest test. However, ANL also raised the issue of<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;information which might be thought to </span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">constitute a low-level interference with personal privacy&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> and,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> same</span><span style="font-style:normal"> context,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> observed</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">that standards of this sort<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;would constrain newspapers from providing the broad mix of </span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">newspaper  that&#8230;&#8230;.ensures  the  very  survival  of  the  industry.&#8221; <sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Here,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> authorities</span><span style="font-style:normal"> do</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognise that a minimum threshold of interference must be attained before the right itself</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may be said to be infringed. Exactly how this should be formulated would be for any future</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">code-maker to consider. Subject to that, any infringement of the substantive right must be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justified.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally under this heading, the criteria specified that the setting of standards must be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent of Government and Parliament, and sufficiently independent of media interests</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in order to command public respect. In some ways this has sparked the most debate. Whilst</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there is universal agreement on the principle of the independent setting, there are also many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposals that would see Parliament laying down some basic criteria which such standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">must attain. This is the case with, for example, the Irish Defamation Act, which has been cited</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by many as a successful example of how Government can incentivise independent regulation.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is also disagreement about what constitutes &#8216;sufficient&#8217; independence of media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interests. Lord Black on behalf of the industry proposed a system in which serving editors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">still had a majority on the committee which set the standards,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup> whereas Ofcom, by contrast,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered it to be &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> unimaginable&#8221;</span> to have anyone currently active within the industry as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">part of the standards setting body.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It would therefore appear that, whilst everyone is willing to support the theory of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independence, it is difficult to find any particular consensus on what independence looks like</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in practice.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">My conclusion is that Criteria 2 as drafted remains the right articulation of fairness and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">objectivity of standards, but with an explicit recognition that not all material published in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers would or should need to satisfy a public interest test as opposed to providing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material which merely entertains or interests the public. The standards must, however,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognise that any infringement of individual rights should only be acceptable where there is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a sufficient public interest rationale.</span>

<h2>4.  Independence and transparency of enforcement and  compliance</h2>


<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The draft Criteria provided that enforcement of ethical standards must be operationally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent of Government and Parliament and sufficiently independent of media interests.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This, by contrast with the setting of standards, has proved relatively uncontroversial. All</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the proposals put forward to the Inquiry included an independent approach to complaint</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">handling, and most attempted to describe a broader independent standards enforcement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">role. There were, inevitably, different views on what constitutes independence, but at a level</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of principle this seems to be genuinely uncontentious.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The draft Criteria also provided that all relevant appointments processes must be sufficiently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independentofGovernment,Parliamentandmediainterests.Thisraisesthebasicconundrum</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of who appoints the appointers. None of those who have provided evidence to the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have suggested that the appointments processes should not be sufficiently independent of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the interests listed, but there are differences around what constitutes &#8216;sufficiently&#8217;, and at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what level the independence needs to be demonstrated. By way of example, in the proposal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from Tim Suter, the Ofcom Content Board would need to approve the independence of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appointment process for any self-regulator, whilst the Content Board<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup> itself is appointed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the Ofcom Board, which is appointed by Government.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup> Lord Black&#8217;s proposal, on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other hand, would rely on an appointment committee composed half and half of industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appointees and lay members to appoint the Chair of a new regulator. I do not accept that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an appointment procedure that allows an effective veto to the industry could be considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be sufficiently independent. Similarly, it must be the case that in relation both to specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforcement and overarching standards compliance the operation and decisions of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator are fully independent from those being regulated.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally under this heading, the draft Criteria specified that compliance must be the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibility of editors, and must be transparent and demonstrable to the public. One</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the strong themes emerging from the proposals submitted to the Inquiry was the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">emphasis on the need for companies to take more responsibility internally for compliance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and for dealing with complaints about standards. This is addressed in Lord Black&#8217;s proposal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">through the presumption that all complaints should be dealt with in the first instance by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">company concerned, the requirement for a named senior executive to have responsibility for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compliance and the requirement for each regulated entity to provide an annual compliance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">report. There may be some question as to whether it is specifically the editor, as opposed for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">instance to the managing editor, who should be responsible for compliance; but the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has seen nothing to suggest that the principle underlying this criteria has anything other than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">full support.</span>

<h2>5. Powers and remedies</h2>

<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The draft Criteria indicated that an effective new regime must provide credible remedies,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both in respect of individuals and of issues affecting wider groups in society. The concept</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of &#8216;credible remedies&#8217; has been the subject of some debate. For many, the publication of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an agreed correction or apology constitutes a credible remedy; for others it does not. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">draft Criteria made no mention of sanctions, as opposed to remedies, but there have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">representations suggesting that a new regulatory regime should include sanctions, including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">power to fine, as well as remedies in respect of particularly serious or systemic breaches.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup> I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">freely accept the argument that sanctions are different in kind to remedies, in that the former</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aim to punish and deter breaches of standards, whilst the latter aim to provide solace for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual affected. I further accept that an effective regulatory regime must have some form</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of sanction, at least for systemic or egregious breaches of standards.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Thereisbroadagreementthattheremustbeasystemofcredibleremediesforindividualswho</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been adversely affected by a breach of standards. However, there are widely differing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">views when it comes to the rights of third parties or groups of people to make complaints or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have access to remedies. In relation to third parties, there is a clear, and reasonable, concern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the risk of such persons or groups making a complaint where the individual directly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerned either is not troubled by the article or, more realistically, would prefer to let the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matter drop. Some have argued that the subject of an article should have a veto on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consideration of a complaint. Plainly, a number of issues arise here. If the system is based</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">solely on remedies then there is little point in taking a complaint from anyone for whom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the range of potential remedies would not be meaningful. Ofcom has argued that, if there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been a breach of regulatory standards, then the regulator should have the discretion to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigate regardless of whether the subject of the relevant article wishes to take the matter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further. In this context the issue is one of industry standards, not abuse of personal rights;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but this is pertinent only to the extent that the regulator can issue some kind of adjudication,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">guidance or sanction that will inform subsequent behaviour, as well as seeking to provide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">redress to an individual who has suffered harm.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-3"><a href="#para5-3" name="para5-3">5.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The British and Irish Ombudsman Association has pointed out that for practical reasons there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">needs to be some limitation on who can bring a complaint. This has been echoed by others,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who fear that in allowing third party complaints, and in particular group complaints, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards regime could be hijacked by groups wanting to fight political battles on the pretext</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of complaining about standards. In particular, ANL has argued:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;This would potentially subvert the purpose of the regulatory system, which is to </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">protect the rights of those affected by the press and promote high standards. It is not </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">to provide a means by which special interest groups can seek to impose their views </span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">on society at large by controlling what is written in the press about them and the </span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am confident that, at some level, it must be possible within any effective new system for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breaches of the relevant code to be drawn to the attention of the enforcement body by those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">affected by the breach, whether in the form of a direct personal reference or more indirectly.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is clearly room for debate as to precisely how this may be achieved and what sort of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remedies or sanctions might be appropriate should a breach of standards be found. I do not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">believe that it is right to characterise the desire of groups to see agreed standards upheld as</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">an attempt to<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;impose their views on society at large by controlling what is written in the press </span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">expectation that they should do so without any group who maintains that those standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are not being upheld being accused of trying to interfere with freedom of expression.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-5"><a href="#para5-5" name="para5-5">5.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The draft Criteria indicated that a new regime must have effective investigatory and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advisory powers. Inevitably, there will be disagreement about what constitutes &#8216;effective&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in this context, but overall this has proved particularly uncontentious in principle, with most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposals including investigatory powers of some sort.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-6"><a href="#para5-6" name="para5-6">5.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The draft Criteria also proposed that any new system should actively support and promote</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compliancewithstandards.Again,atalevelofgeneralitythishasnotprovedtobeacontentious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue, although quite who would be responsible for taking a proactive approach to promoting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compliance varies from model to model. In this context, the draft Criteria suggested a few</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examples of ways in which active support and promotion of standards might happen. One</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of these was kitemarking; the provision of a kitemark is widely seen as an important part of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any voluntary self-regulatory scheme. Some have suggested that the commercial value of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">kitemark would be limited, but others believe that the public would want to buy a product</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that advertised its commitment to standards.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-7"><a href="#para5-7" name="para5-7">5.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The draft Criteria also mentioned the example, under this rubric, of providing confidential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pre-publication advice to editors. This has proved somewhat controversial, but it was not the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intention of the Inquiry by including this feature in the draft criteria to advance any specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposal. In the event, proposals have been submitted to the Inquiry under which some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">facet of a new regulatory system could offer confidential advice to editors, in advance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication, on the merits of any public interest arguments that might later be relied on in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">actions relating to breach of privacy or breach of standards. Such advice would not be binding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in any way, but the fact that advice had been sought (and either followed or ignored) could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be taken into account in any subsequent enforcement action.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-8"><a href="#para5-8" name="para5-8">5.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Concerns have been advanced about such proposals on the grounds that any intervention pre-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication is a fundamental breach of freedom of expression.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup> For example, ANL contend</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;for a regulator to involve itself in pre-publication decisions is to trespass on the editor&#8217;s </span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">role&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> There</span><span style="font-style:normal"> are</span><span style="font-style:normal"> additional</span><span style="font-style:normal"> questions</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> be</span><span style="font-style:normal"> answered</span><span style="font-style:normal"> about</span><span style="font-style:normal"> who</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> appropriate</span><span style="font-style:normal"> body</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be to provide such advice, the relationship between that body and the enforcement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body. Notwithstanding the concerns which have been expressed, for reasons which will be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">elaborated subsequently it remains my view that the provision of pre-publication advice to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editors, on request, would be a useful service for a regulatory body to provide.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally under this heading, the draft Criteria indicated that the new regime would need to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be a good fit with other relevant regulatory and law enforcement functions. This, as one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might have expected, is completely uncontroversial at the level of principle, but may prove</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more difficult to implement in practice. There have been a number of concerns raised about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the boundary between whatever new regime is proposed in this context and the existing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">broadcasting regulation. Some suggestions envisaged bringing together all media under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a unitary approach to regulation, although no-one has gone as far as suggesting a single</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator for all media. Others have expressed concern about the jurisdictional difficulties of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulating online content, and yet others about the boundary with the statutory requirements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on online TV-like services imposed by the Audio Visual Media Services Directive. I share these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns and consider that it will be important that the coverage of any new regime is clearly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">articulated and avoids any overlap between media regulators.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-10"><a href="#para5-10" name="para5-10">5.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">TheInquiryhasheardlittleabouttheneedforanynewstandardssystemtofitwithinanoverall</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effective regime, including criminal and civil law enforcement, although that is obviously</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">essential, indeed, some witnesses have suggested that effective criminal law enforcement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be a sufficient answer to the problems exposed by the Inquiry. I have set out earlier</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the report why this is not, and never will be, a credible solution. I do not see any reason</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">why, where standards and the criminal law overlap, there should not be an expectation that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the regulator would continue to perform its core regulatory functions as it would in respect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of any other standards.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-11"><a href="#para5-11" name="para5-11">5.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">My conclusion is that Criteria 4 as drafted provides a satisfactory set of requirements in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to powers and remedies, subject to the introduction of a further point that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regime should include appropriate and proportionate sanctions for systemic or egregious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breaches of standards.</span>

<a name="section6"></a>
<h2>6. Cost</h2>

<p id="para-id-6-1"><a href="#para6-1" name="para6-1">6.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The draft Criteria stipulated that the solution must be sufficiently reliably financed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allow for reasonable operational independence and appropriate scope, without placing a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disproportionate burden either on the industry, complainants or the taxpayer. As drafted, it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">difficultforanyonetodisagreewiththatproposition andno-onehassoughttodoso.However,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is very difficult at this point to predict what the cost of any of the various approaches that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been put forward to the Inquiry might be. Lord Black estimates that his proposal would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cost in the region of &#163;2.25m<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup> but many editors, in particular from the regional press and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">magazines, have expressed concerns about the robustness of this estimate and whether the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry will be able to afford the attendant costs.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup> Other proposals have suggested that</span>

<a name="page1593"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">Government funding for part of a new regulatory regime might be reasonable, though it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">worth noting that this is rejected by Lord Black as a matter of principle.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-2"><a href="#para6-2" name="para6-2">6.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom has argued that fixed term funding settlements are necessary to provide the level</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of operational independence that any regulatory body would need.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup> Any funding approach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which relied on year by year agreement of the regulator&#8217;s budget would allow too much</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potential for the funding body to influence the approach to compliance and enforcement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken by the body.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-3"><a href="#para6-3" name="para6-3">6.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A common theme running through these proposals is that it should be free for persons</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aggrieved to bring complaints. Obvious questions have been raised about the risk of frivolous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or vexatious complaints but, making due allowance for the fact that mechanisms can be put</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in place to deal with those issues, essentially this is another area on which the Inquiry has</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">seen consensus.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-4"><a href="#para6-4" name="para6-4">6.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">My conclusion is that Criteria 5 as drafted is an appropriate measure, albeit recognising that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;reliability&#8217; of funding means multi-year settlements to protect the independence of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator from undue influence from those funding it.</span>

<h2>7. Accountability</h2>

<p id="para-id-7-1"><a href="#para7-1" name="para7-1">7.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom suggested that a further criteria for the accountability of the new regime should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">added. Specifically, they contended that there should be an independent review of whatever</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">new regime is put in place after three years. Arguably, this is of particular relevance in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context of the history of press self-regulation which demonstrates that historically it has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">difficult to secure any lasting effective change.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup> I agree that an independent review of any</span>
