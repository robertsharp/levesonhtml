<h1>CHAPTER 3<br/>ANALYSIS OF THE MODEL PROPOSED BY THE PCC AND PRESSBOF</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The last Chapter set out the key features of the model presented by Lord Black on behalf of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PressBof and the industry. This Chapter analyses that proposal, in particular in relation to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criteria set out in Chapter 1 above.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. Effectiveness</h2>

<h3>The model must be perceived as credible by the industry</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the criteria for a new effective regulatory regime I said that a new model must be perceived</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as credible by the industry. One aspect of that credibility is the willingness of the industry to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">participate in it. It was recognised by Lord Hunt that a new system would not be perceived to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be effective if a &#8216;big fish&#8217; were not a part of it, accepting that Northern and Shell qualified as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a &#8216;big fish&#8217; for these purposes.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> He went further:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. ... of course if they don&#8217;t sign up and the devil is in the detail, then immediately</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the credibility of the new system would have been fatally undermined. That must</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">follow, mustn&#8217;t it?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A. Yes.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black also accepts this by implication when he identifies the withdrawal of Northern and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ShellfromthePCCasevidenceofa<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;significantstructuralproblem&#8221;</span> withintheexistingsystem.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">My own strong view is that no system of press standards regulation could be considered to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be credible if one or more national newspaper publisher were not covered by it in some way,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">without any consequences as a result.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">So, does the model proposed by Lord Black meet that test? The proposal was submitted to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry by Lord Black in his capacity as Chairman of PressBoF, which is the co-ordinating body for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the newspaper and magazine publishing industry&#8217;s trade associations. Those trade associations</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;While a lot of detailed work is still to be done, the proposals have the broad support</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the organisations and their members. The proposals are being further developed in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the light of comments received as part of the ongoing consultation process.&#8221;</span>

 <p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whilst this model has been offered to the Inquiry by the industry as a whole, some national</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publishers argued for &#8216;even tougher&#8217; controls.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> Lord Black explained that that editors at The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Independent, The financial Times and the Guardian had wanted to look at the whether some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">form of statutory underpinning might be necessary.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These proposals have been the subject of three consultation processes, first on the broad</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">architecture, then on an initial draft contract and set of regulations, and finally on a revised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">set of those documents together with draft articles of association for the new company. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposal submitted to the Inquiry is the result of that extended consultation process.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consultations were primarily conducted through the trade associations, but the documents</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were also made available to those in the industry who are not members of any association.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></span>
<h4>Industry readiness</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Despite this extensive consultation process within the industry, it is clear that the proposals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have not been developed to a stage where many, if any, publishers are yet willing to sign a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contract with the new regulator. Section 6 below looks in detail at the evidence the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has had from the editors of national and regional newspapers, magazines and blogs about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their views of Lord Black&#8217;s proposal and the extent to which they are now ready and willing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to sign up to it. In summary, however, there are a handful of national newspapers which are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">signalling a clear willingness to join, almost irrespective of the final detail of the contract. A</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantial number of other national titles have indicated willingness, in principle, to join</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but have indicated concerns on matters of detail and, in some cases, principle as well. Those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">national titles belonging to the Northern and Shell Group have indicated significant concerns</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the proposals and reservations about joining the system.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Among both magazines and local and regional newspapers there is broad support for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principles that underpin the proposals, coupled with a natural caution about committing to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a contract where the details remain to be settled. A number of the editors who have given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence have identified issues with the proposals that remain to be addressed, and which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would prevent them from signing up to the proposal as currently drafted. None identified any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">points of principle that would prevent them joining at all if the proposal could be amended</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to meet their concerns.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The editors of blogs who have provided evidence to the Inquiry largely felt that the proposal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was irrelevant to them and offered them nothing.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is clear from this that Lord Black&#8217;s proposals enjoy wide support throughout the newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publishing industry, and that magazine publishers are also generally sympathetic to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach. However, the nature of the views expressed is evidence of the process by which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the proposals have been developed, with the national press at the heart of the structure. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fact that a number of major national newspaper publishers are willing to tell the Inquiry that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they are committed to signing up to the proposed scheme is undoubtedly a positive sign.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, the fact that some of the national publishers are still expressing doubts on points of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">detail means that there must be doubt about the ability of PressBoF to secure the agreement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">even of these publishers to the model as presented. Further, the significant concerns on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">points of principle expressed by editors from the Northern and Shell group publications must</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indicate doubt about the likelihood of Northern and Shell ultimately deciding in favour of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">membership of the proposed body.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref5" name="footnote5" title="Go back to footnote reference 5 in the text">5</a>.  p2, para 4, <em>ibid</em></p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref6" name="footnote6" title="Go back to footnote reference 6 in the text">6</a>.  p10, lines 10-22, Lord Black, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-9-July-2012.pdf</p><!--footnote-->

 <p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Under these circumstances, whilst it is clearly possible that all national newspapers would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be prepared to join a system along the lines proposed, I cannot conclude with any certainty</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the system proposed by Lord Black would have any greater coverage among the national</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press than the PCC currently does. This must be regarded as a significant flaw, albeit one that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could be remedied by all major national newspapers signing a contract for membership of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the new system.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A new regulatory system must work for the whole press and the emerging digital market, not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">just for the national press. The local and regional press, with some magazines and online news</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">providers, have identified a number of concerns about the compliance burdens, the cost, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ability of that part of the press to influence the system and the ability of the regulator to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">vary the contract without the support of all members. These are real concerns and I would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">anticipate that the publishers will want to see real answers to them before agreeing to sign</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">up to the system. It might, for example, be sufficient to re-balance the burden of the costs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between local and national publishers but, without detail, it is impossible to say. It would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obviously be important from a credibility perspective that resolving these concerns should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not significantly weaken the independence or regulatory power of the body proposed.</span>

<h3>Incentives to join</h3>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">LordBlacksetsoutfourpotentialincentivesthatcouldbedevelopedtoencouragemembership</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the system. The first would be to limit the provision of press cards to journalists who work</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for an organisation that had signed up to an ethical code.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has been provided with a copy of a proposal which was considered by the UK</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press Card Association (UKPCA).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> The proposal would involve two changes to the process by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which press cards are currently issued. First, the cardholder would have to make a declaration</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that they would abide by an appropriate ethical code. Second, there would be a requirement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the ethical compliance of the cardholder&#8217;s employer or, if he or she was freelance, his or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her main client, professional association or trade union.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-14"><a href="#para2-14" name="para2-14">2.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The proposal would not include any change in the process by which foreign journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are able to be issued with press cards.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup> The UKPCA note that, in respect of broadcasters</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and newspaper and magazine publishers who are members of the industry self-regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body, there would effectively be no change to the current system. Broadcasters are already</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulated by Ofcom and the UKPCA would accept membership of the new self-regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body as sufficient evidence of ethical compliance.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The UKPCA notes that press agencies and picture agencies would need to become ethically</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulated by subscribing to an appropriate code. The Press Association (PA) is currently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subject to the PCC code.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup> There would also be significant changes for individuals who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operate on a freelance basis and for those organisations, such as professional organisations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and trade unions, who act as press card gate keepers for them. In these circumstances the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">UKPCA would expect the gate keeper organisation to have or subscribe to an appropriate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethical code. It is noted that the NUJ already has its own code. In addition, these gatekeepers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would have to certify that, where they were issuing a card to a journalist who is an employee,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">helped to find a gatekeeper.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-17"><a href="#para2-17" name="para2-17">2.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Some significant questions remain unanswered by the proposal. Specifically it is recognised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the scheme would need to deal with questions of eligibility, complaints, misuse,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">misbehaviour and breaches of ethical codes. The UKPCA proposal says that withdrawal of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">card should only be by decision of the gatekeepers&#8217; committee.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-18"><a href="#para2-18" name="para2-18">2.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This proposal was considered by the UK Press Card Association on 10 July 2012 but did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">achieve the 75% majority required for a rule change. The UKPCA has no plans to revisit this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup> Mike Gannatt, the Chair of the UKPCA, gave it as his opinion that this was due not to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any objection in principle to incorporating an ethical dimension to accreditation, but to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attempt to link that with a regulatory regime:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The kitemark proposal foundered over its additional intention to coerce compliance</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with self-regulation. This created insurmountable conflicts of opinion and interest.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-19"><a href="#para2-19" name="para2-19">2.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Despite the UKPCA decision, it is worth considering the merits and disadvantages of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposal in case it should be raised again. A number of witnesses to the Inquiry have raised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantive concerns about it. Harriet Harman QC MP pointed out that the risk with this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposal that citizens and bloggers could be excluded from access to public information. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">many private organisations, such as sports clubs, who hold press conferences might not want</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be a part of such a proposal. The more significant risk was that individual journalists might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lose their accreditation when a wider culture within a publication was to blame. Essentially,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">she said, this proposal was akin to licensing and could inhibit a free press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-20"><a href="#para2-20" name="para2-20">2.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Angela Philips echoed all of these concerns, saying that it would, in effect let the tabloid press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decide who was going to be allowed to be a journalist.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup> There would be no way to protect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a journalist who fell out with management at his or her newspaper who could then simply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">revoke his or her press card.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup> Similarly, Ofcom noted that there would be some definitional</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">difficulties in defining a journalist in a digital environment and that such a system could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potentially have a restrictive effect on rights of freedom of expression.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup> The Media Standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Trust regarded the proposal as:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup></span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;flawed; it is outdated in an age of digital media; discriminatory against the individual</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">blogger or concerned citizen; most likely at odds with the commercial interests of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">many of the organisations it seeks to engage with; and perilously close to a licensing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of journalism by non-state means.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-21"><a href="#para2-21" name="para2-21">2.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By contrast, the Media Regulation Roundtable<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup> and Professor Roy Greenslade<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup> noted the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposal was a worthwhile potential benefit to being a member of a self-regulatory system.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-22"><a href="#para2-22" name="para2-22">2.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I share the concerns of those who liken this proposal to the licensing of journalists. It seems</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to me that the risk of this working in a way which is damaging to competition and freedom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of speech is high. It also seems to me that it puts individual journalists very much at risk</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of being expected to take the consequences of ethical breaches that they may have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressured into by the culture or practice operating inside the newsroom in which they were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">working. In addition to those concerns, I am not convinced that those who want to get their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">message across to the media will see any benefit in cooperating with this proposal, so its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effectiveness as an incentive to membership of a self-regulatory regime may well be limited.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I do not regard this as either a sufficient, or a desirable, approach to encouraging publishers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into a self-regulatory standards regime.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-23"><a href="#para2-23" name="para2-23">2.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second incentive proposed is that the Press Association was looking to see whether it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could provide an incentive to membership of the self-regulatory body by varying the terms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on which it supplies services to non-members.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup> A proposal of this sort would undoubtedly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">raise serious questions about compatibility with competition law. PressBoF has helpfully set</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out the arguments that support the theory that such an arrangement could be considered.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Even if it were to be in breach of s2 of the Competition Act 1998, such an arrangement might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be allowed if it were inherent to the regulatory proposal or if it could be objectively justified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as being in the public interest in raising the professional and ethical standards of the press.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not possible to take a view on whether a proposal of this sort would, in fact, meet any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of those tests without seeing the detail of the proposal. Even if it were to meet those tests it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would also have to be proportionate and the least restrictive method of achieving the desired</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">outcome: I am not at all satisfied that this would be the case.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-24"><a href="#para2-24" name="para2-24">2.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The impact of this proposal would also depend heavily on what was involved. There is a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantial difference, for example, between refusing to supply publishers with copy or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">supplying them on different terms and conditions. In any case, other press agencies exist and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is possible that a publisher outside the system may be able to replace PA services.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-25"><a href="#para2-25" name="para2-25">2.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The third incentive proposed is access for members to a kitemark to signify quality, and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fourth is an entirely undefined suggestion that the advertising industry might be able to help.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I look at these ideas in a little more detail later on, but essentially there is little to suggest that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">either would be particularly effective as incentives.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">I cannot escape the conclusion that this package of incentives, particularly given the position</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">now reached by the UKPCA, does not constitute a compelling argument for any publisher to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">join the body if they were otherwise not inclined to do so. I am very keen to find incentives</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to persuade publishers into independent voluntary regulation and I find it somewhat</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disappointing that the industry, with their own knowledge of what is important to them, have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not managed to come up with a more compelling package than this.</span>
<h3>Contract issues</h3>
<h4>Contract term</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-27"><a href="#para2-27" name="para2-27">2.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Membership of the system would be by a five year rolling contract. The contract would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">require members to pay the agreed levy for the duration of the contract and would bind</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">members to comply with the provisions of the contract, including compliance with the code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and co-operation with investigations, even if they were otherwise to leave the system during</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the term of the contract.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup> Should such a five year contact be signed, it would provide a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasonable degree of certainty for the system for five years. However, there is no certainty</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">over what might happen next. Lord Black suggested two possibilities:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It could work on a 12-month rolling cycle after the five-year term has ended. There</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is another possibility, that the five-year break term could be used to review the terms</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the contract and publishers, if they agree, could then enter another five-year</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">contract.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-28"><a href="#para2-28" name="para2-28">2.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The continuation of the system proposed by Lord Black beyond the initial five year period</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be entirely dependent on the willingness of the industry to enter into a further contract.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, it is entirely possible that at that point the majority might decide to create a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">much less robust system. Lord Black told the Inquiry that he could not see circumstances in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which that would happen. Instead, it would be an opportunity for consideration of how well</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the system worked and any improvements that could be made.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup> He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;So it&#8217;s a break-point that should work, I think, in both ways.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-29"><a href="#para2-29" name="para2-29">2.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In practice, this must represent a very real risk to the sustainability of the proposed model</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">beyond the first five year term. I recognise that no system of regulation could be expected,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or wished, to last for ever, but this degree of built in failure seems problematic. Nor is it clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to me how this could be remedied. I entirely accept that it is not possible to bind people to a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contract in perpetuity, in which case this would appear to be a fundamental problem with a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system which is held together only by contract.</span>
<h4>Transfer of title</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-30"><a href="#para2-30" name="para2-30">2.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Should a member wish to transfer a title to a non-member they are required to use<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;all</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reasonable endeavours&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> ensure</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> new</span><span style="font-style:normal"> owner</span><span style="font-style:normal"> is</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span><span style="font-style:normal"> member</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> regulatory</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scheme.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup> This stops short of the more obvious requirement that a title may not be transferred</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref29" name="footnote29" title="Go back to footnote reference 29 in the text">29</a>.  p5, para 11, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Lord-Black-of-Brentwood-Annex-B1.pdf</p><!--footnote-->

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">unless the new owner signs a contract with the scheme. Lord Black explained that the looser</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">formulation was intended to protect the position of proprietors of local newspapers, where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a degree of consolidation in the market is expected and proprietors are reluctant to have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their hands tied in the matter of potential purchasers. However, Lord Black pointed out that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">most transfers of titles were likely to be between publishers who were already members of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the system so the issue would not arise often.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup> I recognise the concern expressed in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the economic difficulties faced in particular by local newspapers. However, this is a rather</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obvious weak link in the argument that the contract binds newspapers into the system.</span>
<h4>Contract variation</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-31"><a href="#para2-31" name="para2-31">2.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The structure of the system is that all publishers would enter into a bilateral contract with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the regulator. Those contracts would all be identical. The contract could be varied where a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">majority agrees to variation. The precise mechanism for this is not set out in the proposal put</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Inquiry. Lord Black explained that the majority would have to be calculated on the basis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of weighted votes:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t weighted votes, you could have a situation in which, because they are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">much greater in number, the magazine publishers could change the contract by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">outvoting everybody else. So we need to have (sic) find some way of doing that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which gives no group of regulated entities a power of veto over changes, but that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">voting procedure reflects the nature and diversity of the market. I can&#8217;t pretend we&#8217;ve</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cracked that one.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is a potentially significant issue. Some in the industry have raised their unease about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being subject to a contract which could be varied without their agreement. Clearly the exact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nature of the weighting will be an important issue for all in the industry and may be difficult</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to resolve. Should it not be possible to reach agreement on a method of varying the contract</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by majority, the only alternative would be for any change to require unanimity; this would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">make changes extremely difficult to achieve.</span>
<h4>Enforcement</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-32"><a href="#para2-32" name="para2-32">2.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As further explained in paragraphs 5.23-5.35 below, the contract model is designed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">introduce a measure of internal enforceability. I underline &#8216;internal&#8217;, because it is of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">essence of the contractual arrangement that it is not intended to be enforceable at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suit of a third party &#8211; a reader, say, or member of the public. It relies in other words on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a credible prospect of (expensive and uncertain) litigation proceedings between the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisations themselves to enforce the contract against each other. There must be real</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">questions about that credibility in real life. The likely motivations of press organisations to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contemplate suing each other to retain commitment to the contract are very far from clear.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In any event, classically, contractual disputes tend to be settled commercially by the payment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of compensation rather than the specific enforcement of the terms of a contract. Even within</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the terms of the contract, there is at the very least an area of doubt and complexity about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extent to which financial penalties could be enforced in a contract action.</span>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref34" name="footnote34" title="Go back to footnote reference 34 in the text">34</a>.  pp108-109, lines 21-16, Lord Black, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-9-July-2012.pdf</p><!--footnote-->

 <h4>The model must be perceived as credible by the public</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-33"><a href="#para2-33" name="para2-33">2.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Any new model must also be perceived as credible by the public. The industry has not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attempted to conduct any consultation with the public on the proposals put forward or taken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any steps to understand public expectations of press standards. Lord Black told the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this was due to a lack of opportunity to do so but suggested that newspapers would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">uniquely well placed to<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;take</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> temperature</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> public&#8221;</span> on the proposals if that was felt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be helpful.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup> Similarly, Lord Hunt said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;One thing which I had been contemplating is that at some stage we ought to have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a public consultation, but I felt that to do anything in that direction would be wrong</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pending the result of this Inquiry.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-34"><a href="#para2-34" name="para2-34">2.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I find it extraordinary that, given the acceptance by Lord Black and the newspaper industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the current system of press regulation has lost public confidence, they did not regard</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public views on the matter as of sufficient interest or importance to make any effort to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ascertain them. I find it more extraordinary that, having had its attention drawn to this point</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the Inquiry, there is still no sign of the industry making any effort to understand public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expectations in relation to press standards. This lack of interest in the views of the public may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be symptomatic of the approach that the press has consistently taken towards regulation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">over many decades. It demonstrates the extent to which the press continue to prioritise their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">own interests, with consideration of the wider public interest only in as much as it applies to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the importance of protecting the freedom of the press, and only then to the extent that they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can appoint themselves the arbiter of it.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-35"><a href="#para2-35" name="para2-35">2.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry placed Lord Black&#8217;s proposal on the Inquiry website and sought comments from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interested parties and the general public. For the most part the responses have been from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those already engaged with the Inquiry.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-36"><a href="#para2-36" name="para2-36">2.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A submission on behalf of the Core Participant Victims said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref38" href="#footnote38">38</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Module 4 CPVs have considered the submissions and evidence of Lord Hunt and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Lord Black. The Module 4 CPVs all agree that the proposal advocated by Lord Hunt and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Black for a new contractual self-regulatory body would not be a satisfactory solution.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The proposal is considered to be an insufficiently clean break from the current PCC</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the failings associated with that organisation. In the event that this system was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">established, it is anticipated by the Module 4 CPVs that complainants would be likely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to prefer court proceedings as a forum for seeking redress.&#8221;</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It is by no means certain that all publications will sign the contract, whether new</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">contract</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There would be a chilling effect on the system as adverse adjudications could deter</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proprietors from signing the contract or renewing the contract</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The system would not be independent &#8211; it would still be run by the industry, for the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">industry</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Contracts would be between the press itself &#8211; they would not necessarily help the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">public.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-38"><a href="#para2-38" name="para2-38">2.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Media Standards Trust similarly raised concerns that there were insufficient incentives</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">either to join or to stay in the system and that the reliance on goodwill to keep publishers in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the system would make it difficult to impose any meaningful sanction on a publisher.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-39"><a href="#para2-39" name="para2-39">2.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The British and Irish Ombudsman Association said that they did not consider the proposed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">model to be appropriate because it would be wrong for the dispute-resolution body not to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent of the regulator and the remedies proposed were too limited.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup></span>
<h4>Benefits to the public</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-40"><a href="#para2-40" name="para2-40">2.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is important to note that the proposal put forward by Lord Black gives no rights of any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sort to members of the public. The contracts are between the publishers and the regulators.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Third parties have no rights under the contract and nothing else in the proposal gives those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who are either customers of the press or victims of press behaviour any rights in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints or redress. Lord Black acknowledged this, but suggested that the rights of third</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parties would be protected by the potential to take an action for judicial review.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup> Whilst it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arguable whether the Trust, as envisaged in this proposal, would be subject to judicial review,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black repeated to the Inquiry that it would be unlikely that the industry would contest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that point.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-41"><a href="#para2-41" name="para2-41">2.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is not a sufficiently credible answer. It is surprising, given the evidence that has been put</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">before the Inquiry of the harm that the press can do, and have done, to the lives of ordinary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals, that the industry has not felt it necessary to address anywhere in the system the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rights of individuals. I have said, many times, that any new regulatory system must work for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public and for a system to work for the public it should have the rights and interests of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public at its heart. This proposal manifestly fails that test.</span>
<h4>What difference will it make?</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-42"><a href="#para2-42" name="para2-42">2.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The credibility of the system must also depend on the impact that it would have. The Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sought evidence from editors as to the practical differences that the proposal would make if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was implemented. The detail of those responses is set out below,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup> but the overwhelming</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">answer was that it would make no practical difference whatsoever. Some editors noted that</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">they would have to make procedural or administrative changes, but there was no suggestion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from any editor that Lord Black&#8217;s proposal would require any changes to the ethical conduct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or approach to standards within their title.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-43"><a href="#para2-43" name="para2-43">2.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is fair to say that all the editors who provided evidence argued that standards in their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newsrooms were already high and it might be argued that the question could be said to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assume, for each title, that change was necessary. I simply note that the abuses of which the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry has heard evidence, and which are documented in this Report, have happened under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the current systems of standards governance in place within newsrooms and that all have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognised that the public has lost confidence in that system. If the proposals put forward by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black would not make any practical or cultural difference, then it is difficult to see how</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they could be said to be a sufficient answer to the problem that the Inquiry has identified.</span>
<h4>Scope and membership</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-44"><a href="#para2-44" name="para2-44">2.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The proposal includes provision to allow the Industry Funding Body (IFB) absolute discretion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to refuse membership. Lord Black explained that this provision was essentially to allow the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry to refuse membership to top shelf publications, whose membership would be wholly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inappropriate because they would only give rise to complaints about taste and decency,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which was outside the scope of the body.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup> I find this problematic. First, it is difficult to see</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">why it should be the IfB, rather than the Trust itself, which takes decisions on whether or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not it is appropriate for a publisher to be a member of the Trust. Secondly, and of greater</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significance, the provision as drafted allows the IFB to refuse membership to any publisher</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for any reason, giving rise to the possibility that a publisher could be excluded for commercial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or other reasons. finally, I do not understand the problem about taste and decency. If such a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaint is outside the scope of the code (as at present), it will be very easy to deal with it.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It seems to me that it is essential that any regulatory body, self or otherwise, should be open</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to all in the industry to participate in on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis.</span>

<h2>3. Fairness and objectivity of standards</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This criterion specifies the need for a credible statement of ethical standards, set in a way</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that is sufficiently independent of media interests to command public respect.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Under Lord Black&#8217;s proposal the Code Committee would retain responsibility for defining the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards to be complied with by the press, including the definition of the public interest,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">albeit with the regulator having to approve any changes to the code. The Code Committee</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would comprise 17 members, of whom 12 would be serving editors, with three public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">members and the Chair and Chief Executive of the regulator.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup> This clearly puts the definition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the public interest in the hands of industry, not of the public as represented by the majority</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent members on the Board. Lord Black was reluctant to contemplate the idea that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Committee might instead, have an equal number of public members and serving editors:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup></span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref45" name="footnote45" title="Go back to footnote reference 45 in the text">45</a>.  p106, lines 11-15, Lord Black, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-9-July-2012.pdf</p><!--footnote-->

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think that the Code Committee is, in effect, the only &#8211; because there are independent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">majorities throughout the rest of this, the Code Committee is the only genuinely self-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regulatory bit. I think there is significant moral authority that comes from a code</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which is written by a committee with significant public involvement but that is written</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by editors. So I think there would be some fairly robust views expressed about a view</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that there should be parity on that.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He indicated that, in his opinion, the industry would be unlikely to accept such a change.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If one were to accept that it is reasonable for the industry to be in a majority in writing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the code, it is also worth considering whether it is appropriate that those representing the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry should be serving editors. Lord Black argued that this was essential:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref49" href="#footnote49">49</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;this has always been the Editors&#8217; Code and it has always been the view that it is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">important that editors write it. That is the way that their newsrooms buy into it. That</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is the way the publishers buy into it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black denied that serving editors would have a degree of self-interest in how the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards set in the code:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: It might be thought they have a certain degree of self-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">interest.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. They have self-interest in making the code work.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">MR JAY: I think it was you, Lord Black, who used the phrase &#8220;buy into it&#8221;, which is a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">synonym for self-interest, isn&#8217;t it?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. No, I don&#8217;t think it is a synonym for self-interest. I meant &#8220;buy into it&#8221; in terms of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they are the ones that have got to make sure their colleagues stick by the letter of it,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they&#8217;re the ones that have to deal with any complaints that come in under the terms</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of it. They need to know that it is a practical document. They need intellectual buy in,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as much as anything else.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He argued instead that only serving editors would have the practical day-to-day understanding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of what life was like in newsrooms and how the rules needed to change to reflect that.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">51</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I simply do not accept that. Whilst I recognise the importance of having a strong editorial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voice advising on standards, it seems to me quite wrong that editors should actually be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsible for setting standards. It would be quite reasonable for the Trust Board to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advised by the Code Committee, constituted as Lord Black proposes, but the Board should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">retain responsibility for the code. It is arguable that the Trust Board does have the final say</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the code in this proposal, as they would have to agree any changes to the code, but the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">distinction is important. Whatever mechanism is put in place as to the weight to be attached</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to advice from the Code Committee, I am not clear that allowing serving editors to set the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">code provides sufficient independence from the industry to command public respect.</span>

<h2>4.  Independence and transparency of enforcement and  compliance</h2>


<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This criterion covers the mechanisms for enforcement and compliance, the independence of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the bodies carrying out those roles and the methods by which they do so.</span>
<h4>&#8216;Independently led self-regulation&#8217;</h4>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black presented the model as &#8216;independently led self-regulation&#8217;:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref52" href="#footnote52">52</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;it is a self-regulatory system because it is generated from within the newspaper</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">industry and relies on the newspaper industry for funding, but it is independently led in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that all the component parts of the regulator have very clear independent majorities</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in it and that those independent majorities are guaranteed by the independent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">appointment processes that the trust board will put into place. So it is self-regulation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but it is led and managed by a wholly independent body.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is worth considering what is meant by &#8216;independently-led&#8217; here and the extent to which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the proposals address the fundamental requirement for independence. The first issue that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commonly gives rise to an impression that the current system is not independent is the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">presence of serving editors on both the Code Committee and the Complaints Committee. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposal before the Inquiry retains both, albeit with the addition of an independent voice in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Code Committee.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black defended this position:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I used the phrase earlier &#8220;independently led self-regulation&#8221;. If the &#8220;self&#8221; in that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">phrase is to mean anything, then it has to mean the presence of editors on the Code</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Committee, albeit buttressed by a minority of lay members, and it has to mean the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expertise of senior serving newspaper figures on the complaints committee, again,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">though, in a substantial minority.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">What we&#8217;ve tried to do here is to make sure that actually the complaints arm and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">standards investigation arm are structurally shielded from the industry funding body,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whose powers are significantly diminished from the existing Press Standards Board</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of Finance, which is why the key in this body is the presence of this new trust board.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I do not accept that the concept of &#8216;self-regulation&#8217; requires the presence of serving editors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">either on the body that sets the standards, although, as I have indicated, I recognise that it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would certainly be desirable that serving editors should have an advisory role in standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">setting, or on the body that takes decisions on complaints. Self-regulation can equally mean</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">self-ownedandself-designedregulation,byindependentpeople,ledbyaChairmanappointed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by a panel which included &#8216;self&#8217;. The Industry&#8217;s unwillingness to address public concern on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this matter is a real indication that the proposal to a significant extent represents a broad</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">continuation of the status quo rather than a fundamental shift in attitude or an acceptance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the need for independent regulation.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second issue that has been raised, particularly in the context of Mr Desmond&#8217;s decision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to leave the PCC, is the way that a few powerful individuals have been able to dominate the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system. This has been an observed flaw in the existing system and Lord Black acknowledged</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">It has been pointed out by a number of commentators that the proposal is very much focused</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">around the industry&#8217;s interests. This is particularly evident in the formulation of the objects of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Community Interest Company that would be the regulator:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref55" href="#footnote55">55</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Activities which benefit the community, in particular to promote and uphold the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">highest professional standards of journalism.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">[&#8230;..]</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Having regard at all times to the importance in a democratic society of the freedom</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of expression and the public&#8217;s right to know.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is nothing in these objects about the rights of individuals or the importance of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest in other rights beyond freedom of expression, such as an individual&#8217;s right to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privacy. Lord Black argued that these concepts were embodied within the phrase<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> highest</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">professional standards of journalism&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref56" href="#footnote56">56</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> I</span><span style="font-style:normal"> can</span><span style="font-style:normal"> see</span><span style="font-style:normal"> no</span><span style="font-style:normal"> reason</span><span style="font-style:normal"> why</span><span style="font-style:normal"> it</span><span style="font-style:normal"> would</span><span style="font-style:normal"> not</span><span style="font-style:normal"> be</span><span style="font-style:normal"> sensible</span><span style="font-style:normal"> for</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these matters to be reflected explicitly in the objects of the regulator, and I welcome Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Black&#8217;s statement that he has no objection to the Article 8 rights being set out.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref57" href="#footnote57">57</a></sup></span>
<h4>Independence from Government</h4>

<p id="para-id-4-8"><a href="#para4-8" name="para4-8">4.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This criterion, which is clearly extremely important, requires that the enforcement of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards should be independent of Government. Lord Black argued that the only way to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ensure this independence was to have full self-regulation with no statutory involvement of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any kind. I look in detail at the arguments surrounding statutory recognition of self-regulation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and statutory underpinning to self-regulation later in the Report.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref58" href="#footnote58">58</a></sup> Here it suffices to say that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the proposed industry model has no point of contact with Government and would certainly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remain independent from Government.</span>
<h4>Structures and appointments</h4>

<p id="para-id-4-9"><a href="#para4-9" name="para4-9">4.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The independence of the system will depend largely on the structures, but also on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independence of the procedures by which key post holders are appointed.</span>
<h4>The Trust Board</h4>

<p id="para-id-4-10"><a href="#para4-10" name="para4-10">4.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The most important appointment, self evidently, is the Chair of the Trust Board. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appointment of the Chair, who would have no press background, would be made by a four</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">person panel with two industry members and two public members, making a unanimous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup> Lord Black defended this process as<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;independent</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> press</span><span style="font-style:italic"> interests&#8221;</span> on the</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">grounds that it was a<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;balance&#8221;</span> with neither press nor lay interests having control of it.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup> I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">do not find this entirely convincing. A requirement for unanimity across an equally weighted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">panel effectively gives a veto to either side. That is certainly balance of a kind, but it puts a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considerable amount of influence in the hands of the industry in relation to what should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an independent appointment. Lord Black indicated that the proposal in front of the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was the industry&#8217;s<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;best</span><span style="font-style:italic"> current</span><span style="font-style:italic"> shot&#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref61" href="#footnote61">61</a></sup> and that he would look at an alternative model that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would provide a majority of lay members on the panel.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref62" href="#footnote62">62</a></sup> In my opinion, it is of fundamental</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">importance that the Chair of any regulatory body should be independently appointed, and a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mechanism that puts a veto in the hands of the industry does not constitute an independent</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">process.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-11"><a href="#para4-11" name="para4-11">4.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The other members of the Board would be three lay people and three press representatives.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The lay people would be appointed by an independent process to be determined by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Board. The industry representatives would be individuals with senior editorial or publishing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">experience, but not serving editors, and would be appointed by the IFB.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref63" href="#footnote63">63</a></sup> If the issue around</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the appointment of the Chair were resolved, these procedures would appear to provide for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independently appointed independent members to hold the majority on the Trust Board.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It would also be important that, if those appointed with editorial or publishing experience</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remain in employment, they are appointed with true independence and not merely as proxies.</span>
<h4>The Code Committee</h4>

<p id="para-id-4-12"><a href="#para4-12" name="para4-12">4.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Code Committee would comprise 12 or 13 industry members, drawn from across the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref64" href="#footnote64">64</a></sup> These 12 or 13 would be serving editors but no evidence has been presented on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">how they are to be<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;drawn</span><span style="font-style:italic"> from</span><span style="font-style:italic"> across</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> industry&#8221;</span> . The Chairman and the CEO of the Trust</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would automatically sit on the Code Committee, and the Trust Board would appoint a further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">three public members who may, but do not need to, be members of the Board or of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Complaints Committee.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref65" href="#footnote65">65</a></sup> The proposal to introduce public members to the Code Committee</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">must be regarded as a positive step.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-13"><a href="#para4-13" name="para4-13">4.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have already set out my views on the extent to which it is inappropriate to have serving</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editors responsible, albeit subject to the approval of the Board, for setting the standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to which they are expected to adhere. I do not, therefore, regard the Code Committee,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in a standards setting capacity, as sufficiently independent of industry. As I have equally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made clear, however, I do think that the body as described could operate appropriately as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an advisory body with the Trust Board having final responsibility for the code. I appreciate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that advice from such a body would have to be accorded appropriate respect, that it would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be important for editors to &#8216;buy into&#8217; the code and that the Trust Board would therefore</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be extremely reluctant to approve a change contrary to the views of the Committee but,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although to some extent symbolic, the difference is important. As will equally be clear when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considering the Complaints Committee below, the suggestion that those in charge of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulated entities should be responsible for the code pursuant to which they are regulated is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not one that would (or should) command support.</span>

 <h4>The Complaints Committee</h4>

<p id="para-id-4-14"><a href="#para4-14" name="para4-14">4.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Complaints Committee comprises the Chairman of the Board, seven lay members</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appointed by an independent process, and five working editors.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref66" href="#footnote66">66</a></sup> One concern would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that having serving editors on the complaints body creates the perception, at the very least,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a lack of independence. Indeed, it is the presence of serving editors on the Complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Committee that gives rise to the concept of editors marking their own homework. Ed Richards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Colette Bowe from Ofcom gave their clear opinion that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref67" href="#footnote67">67</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;in terms of code setting, in terms of sanctions, in terms of corrections or anything</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of that kind and in terms of policy making overall, you need to have a bright line</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">separation between those who are regulating and making decisions and those who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are regulated, and I think any breach of that [&#8230;.] means that you will immediately</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">undermine the perception and indeed in reality the actuality of your independence.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black argued that the industry view was that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref68" href="#footnote68">68</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;these need to be people who are absolutely at the cutting edge of their trade.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He said that the independence of the Complaints Committee was adequately ensured by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent majority on the Committee and the right of appeal to an independent assessor:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref69" href="#footnote69">69</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think that body is constructed so that it has a tangibly clear independent majority</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on it, and we&#8217;re also, as you&#8217;re seeing at the bottom, building in an independent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">assessment of that. So if there was a member of the public who had any concern</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about the process in the way it had been handled, that one of these minority editors</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had had some sort of undue influence, that independent assessment, which would be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by somebody who had nothing to do with the newspaper industry, would be thrown</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">up.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-15"><a href="#para4-15" name="para4-15">4.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thepossibility thatretirededitors,forexampleinacademicpositions,oranNUJrepresentative,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could provide the required knowledge to the Committee was dismissed by Lord Black,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although someone who edited a &#8216;website within a newspaper&#8217; might be considered.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref70" href="#footnote70">70</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-16"><a href="#para4-16" name="para4-16">4.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Again, I do not consider that this brings the required degree of independence from industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the enforcement of standards. An argument is often advanced that doctors sit on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">British Medical Association disciplinary panels so there cannot be a problem with editors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the Complaints Committee. The problem with this argument is that individual doctors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are not to be compared to editors: there is only a very small pool of national editors to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">draw from, making it impossible to create a panel where the members would not know the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">people on whom they were adjudicating and have views about them and their title. I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not considered whether it would be appropriate for there to be a role for a serving editor to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be able to provide written advice to the Complaints Committee, but I do not accept that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Committee should have serving editors sitting on it.</span>

 <h4>The Compliance and Investigation Panel</h4>

<p id="para-id-4-17"><a href="#para4-17" name="para4-17">4.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Trust Board would maintain a &#8216;pool of experts&#8217; from whom they could appoint a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Compliance and Investigation Panel when the need arose. The names of the people in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pool would be published and each specific panel would be appointed, by the Trust Board, to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suit the specific demands of an investigation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref71" href="#footnote71">71</a></sup> The basic structure here seems sufficiently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent from any relevant interest. The Inquiry has not been given enough information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the methods by which the experts will be appointed to the panel to take a view on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adequacy of those processes, but there are no immediate concerns here.</span>
<h4>The Industry Funding Body</h4>

<p id="para-id-4-18"><a href="#para4-18" name="para4-18">4.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has been given no information about the composition or, of appointment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">procedures for, the IFB as Lord Black explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref72" href="#footnote72">72</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;while we have been able to establish some general principles about its operation,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the details are still in progress, and will need to be subject to a further round of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">industry consultation.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Clearly the IfB will not, and cannot, be independent of industry. It is undeniable, however,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there is very real merit in it being considerably more transparent so that the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are aware of the different influences within the IFB. The most significant point of interest is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">around the relationship between the IFB and the Trust Board.</span>
<h4>Relationship between the IFB and the Trust</h4>

<p id="para-id-4-19"><a href="#para4-19" name="para4-19">4.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One of the arguments put forward by Lord Black as to the enhanced independence of his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposal, by comparison with the PCC, is the fact that the IFB has a relationship only with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Trust Board, not with the operational parts of the regulatory organisation. This assertion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bears closer scrutiny, in particular as it impacts on the investigations and compliance role</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the regulator. An exchange between Mr Jay and Lord Black sets out clearly the extent to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which the Trust Board, with whom the IFB have their direct relationship, has responsibility for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all the significant decisions in relation to an investigation:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref73" href="#footnote73">73</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q&#8230;but are we agreed to this extent: that trust board approval is required to establish</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an investigation? Is that right?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A. Yes.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Trust board approval is also required to take action to enforce the contract in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relation to an investigation; is that right?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A. Yes.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. The trust board, you&#8217;ve told me this earlier, handles appeals against a finding of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the compliance and investigation panel.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. By setting up a new panel.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. By setting up a new bundle (sic). And the trust board must take the decision on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">raising any fine in relation to an investigation; is that right?</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Correct.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. And the trust board also ratifies changes to the code, doesn&#8217;t it?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A. Yes.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-20"><a href="#para4-20" name="para4-20">4.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whilst there is nothing objectionable in the Trust Board having these roles in respect of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigations, it is not possible, in the light of this, to also argue that the IFB, by interacting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only with the Trust Board, has no interactions with parts of the body that are taking regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decisions. The Trust Board is quite clearly taking regulatory decisions here; indeed, it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsible for all of the most significant regulatory decisions in relation to an investigation.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black argued that this would not matter as investigations would be funded from a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ring-fenced enforcement fund, which is to be established at the outset and will not be the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibility of the IfB.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref74" href="#footnote74">74</a></sup> This is not a sufficient argument. The influence of the IFB derives</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from its position as the funding body for the regulator, but is not therefore limited to matters</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that fall to be funded by it. The risk, surely, is that the Trust Board might seek to avoid causing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">friction with the IFB in relation to investigations in order to preserve a good relationship on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the wider funding issue.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-21"><a href="#para4-21" name="para4-21">4.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The IFB has a number of other roles in the system. It is responsible for the code, although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the code must be agreed by the Trust. The Trust is responsible for the Regulations, though</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they must be agreed by the IFB. These complementary roles provide a model of regulation in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which the industry has a very strong say, both through being in the lead in setting standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and having a veto over the Regulations governing the maintenance of those standards. Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Black argued that this was a very important system of checks and balances, to protect the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry from a regulator which might want to make changes that would destroy the industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whilst simultaneously protecting the regulator from any attempt by the industry to scale</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">back regulation. He did, however, suggest that a stipulation could be added to the contract</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that no changes to the contract or to the regulations could ever dilute the power of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref75" href="#footnote75">75</a></sup> In relation to changes to the code, Lord Black said that the Trust Board would have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ultimate responsibility for a change, with the IFB essentially having a role in managing a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prior consultation process. He recognised that this was not what the documents provided to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry set out and that some redrafting would be necessary to achieve that effect.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref76" href="#footnote76">76</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-22"><a href="#para4-22" name="para4-22">4.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ThepowersoftheIFB,whichrunthroughoutthisproposal,undermineclaimstoindependence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the regulatory system. Lord Black talks of independently led-self regulation but it is not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear that leadership in this system can come from the Trust. Rather, there is a joint system</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of leadership between the Trust and the IfB in which the IfB has the lead in many important</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues, in particular the funding of the body, the definition of the code and setting sanctions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">guidelines; it also has significant influence in many others, such as the appointment of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Trust Chair and changes to the Regulations. Removing the IFB from decision relating to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appointments, the code, the Regulations and sanctions would go a long way to enhancing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the independence of the proposed system.</span>
<h3>Complaint handling</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-23"><a href="#para4-23" name="para4-23">4.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Members of the new system will be expected to try to resolve complaints directly with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the complainant in the first instance. The intention here is to improve transparency and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accountability within publishers, as well as to reduce the workload for the regulator.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref77" href="#footnote77">77</a></sup> This is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a sensible development.</span>

 <h4>Third party complaints</h4>

<p id="para-id-4-24"><a href="#para4-24" name="para4-24">4.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The proposal would give the regulator the power to take up a third party complaint where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there has been a significant breach of the Editors&#8217; Code and there is a substantial public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest in allowing the complaint to be brought.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref78" href="#footnote78">78</a></sup> Lord Black gave evidence that the new body,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in line with current practice in the PCC, would always be able to take third party complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on a matter of accuracy.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref79" href="#footnote79">79</a></sup> That is not reflected in the drafting of the regulations, which would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appear to restrict third party accuracy complaints to<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;significant</span><span style="font-style:italic"> breaches&#8221;</span> with a<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;substantial</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public interest&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Lord</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Black</span><span style="font-style:normal"> provided</span><span style="font-style:normal"> assurance</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> it</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> not</span><span style="font-style:normal"> intended</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> have</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> effect,</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but on the contrary was intended to make it easier for groups to bring discrimination</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints under the discrimination clause of the code;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref80" href="#footnote80">80</a></sup> it remained important, however,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the regulator to have discretion over when to take up third party or group complaints on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues such as discrimination.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref81" href="#footnote81">81</a></sup> As it stands, this wording appears to significantly raise the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">threshold for third party complaints about accuracy. I accept Lord Black&#8217;s assurance that this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is not the intention but it is important that that point should be clarified.</span>
<h4>Compliance reports</h4>

<p id="para-id-4-25"><a href="#para4-25" name="para4-25">4.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The proposed scheme introduces annual compliance reports which would set out compliance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">systems and report on any compliance breaches and the steps taken to remedy them. These</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reports form an important part of the standards function of the new model. The reports</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be sent to the Head of Standards and Investigations (an official position at the Trust)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whose team would analyse the reports. It is anticipated that this will lead to dialogue with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the publishers about the actions that they have taken over the year and the extent to which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the report demonstrates active compliance with the standards. Once the reports are finalised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is expected that they will be published. The contract would require regulated entities to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be open and cooperative towards the regulator and to disclose any significant breaches of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the code promptly.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref82" href="#footnote82">82</a></sup> It would be open to the Trust to take action, including potentially the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">launch of a full scale investigation, to require the reports to be full and frank should that be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary. The process of reaching agreement on the annual report between the publisher</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the regulator would be a proportionate one, taking into account the size and nature of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the publisher.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref83" href="#footnote83">83</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-26"><a href="#para4-26" name="para4-26">4.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This proposal strikes me as an eminently sensible one. It must be right that the primary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibility for compliance lies with the company and they should be encouraged to take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that responsibility seriously. A requirement of this sort should significantly enhance the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transparency of compliance across the industry and put pressure on management within</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">each title to ensure that they have a good story to tell. It might also be reasonable to suggest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that newspapers should publish their annual compliance reports in their own pages to ensure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that their readers have easy access to the information.</span>

 <p id="para-id-4-27"><a href="#para4-27" name="para4-27">4.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The proposal also requires publishers to identify a named senior individual within each</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">company who is responsible for the maintenance of standards, compliance with the code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of practice, reporting annually to the regulator and then dealing with the follow up from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the regulator.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref84" href="#footnote84">84</a></sup> Arguments may be made about whether that senior individual should, of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessity, be the editor or the proprietor but, in any event, this also seems like a sensible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">innovation that could, if operated properly, encourage real change within organisations.</span>
<h4>Whistleblowing</h4>

<p id="para-id-4-28"><a href="#para4-28" name="para4-28">4.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Hunt raised a concern that had not been picked up by the industry proposal, namely that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there should be a whistleblowing hotline into the new regulatory structure for those who feel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that they are being asked to do things which are contrary to the code.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref85" href="#footnote85">85</a></sup> It is a shame that this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has not been taken on board by the industry proposal: it is obviously sensible.</span>

<a name="section5"></a>
<h2>5. Powers and remedies</h2>

<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The sanctions available to the regulator differ substantially depending on whether an issue is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dealt with via the complaints arm or the standards arm. The Complaints Committee has the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">power to issue an adverse adjudication, and to negotiate the wording, size and placement of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a correction or apology, but it cannot impose a fine, even in an egregious case.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref86" href="#footnote86">86</a></sup></span>
<h4>Complaints Lack of adjudication</h4>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black explained that conciliation remained at the heart of the proposed complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">process because<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> bulk</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> complaints</span><span style="font-style:italic"> will</span><span style="font-style:italic"> lend</span><span style="font-style:italic"> themselves</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> conciliation.&#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref87" href="#footnote87">87</a></sup> It would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">open to the regulator, in the case of a serious breach that could nonetheless be resolved to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the complainant&#8217;s satisfaction by way of conciliation, to reach a full-scale adjudication. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Complaints Committee can call on a publisher to take disciplinary action against an editor.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-3"><a href="#para5-3" name="para5-3">5.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">My concern in this context is that a great proportion of the complaints made to the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">currently are rejected at the first point of contact, and the vast majority of those that are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">looked at are resolved through mediation. Just because it has proved possible to resolve a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaint to the satisfaction of the complainant without a formal adjudication there is no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">guarantee that a breach of the code was not committed; indeed, the reverse is likely to be the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case on the basis that the clear cases will be conceded and redress provided. On the other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hand, only those few that go to a full adjudication ever get to the stage at which a breach of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the code is recorded. This allows the fiction that only a handful of breaches of the code occur</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">each year to go unchallenged.</span>

 <p id="para-id-5-4"><a href="#para5-4" name="para5-4">5.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black told the Inquiry that it would be open to the regulator to decide that it wished to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adjudicate more. In particular this would be helpful for the regulator when considering best</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice guidelines which would tend to be informed by adjudications. Lord Black accepted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there was no principled objection to setting some sort of threshold above which cases</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would automatically go forward to adjudication:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref88" href="#footnote88">88</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Do you think it might be better to have a sort of threshold written into the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regulations which, if the regulator thought that there was prima facie evidence of a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">serious breach of the code or breach of the code which was other than minimum or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">raised minor questions of inaccuracy, then unless the complainant wished otherwise,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">almost as a matter of obligation, the regulator should take that forward to an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">adjudication?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I would expect that to be the best practice of the regulator. If there&#8217;s a case for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">writing that in, if it can be codified in a way which can be written into regulations,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">then I wouldn&#8217;t see a principled objection to that&#8230;&#8230;I would hope it would be a matter</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of best practice, but if there is merit in codifying it, we will.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-5"><a href="#para5-5" name="para5-5">5.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I think this is very important: the regulator must have a clear sense of the scale of code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breaches that it is dealing with both in relation to individual publishers and in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the industry as a whole. This information about breaches of the code would be of critical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">importance to the management at the individual publishers and to the regulator in its role</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of promoting and maintaining standards. It is also important that mediated complaints are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recorded, with code breaches identified. It is difficult to see how systemic failures in code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compliance could be detected if code breaches are not identified as such by the Complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Committee.</span>
<h4>Remedies and sanctions available for complaints</h4>

<p id="para-id-5-6"><a href="#para5-6" name="para5-6">5.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The remedies and sanctions available to the Complaints Committee are described as:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref89" href="#footnote89">89</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;a ladder of sanctions from a fairly straightforward correction through to a breach</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the code that&#8217;s remedied and identified in statistics, through to a formal reprimand</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the editor, right up to where there has been a very serious breach and that leads</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to a referral from the complaints arm to the publisher because it raises contractual</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">disputes&#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-7"><a href="#para5-7" name="para5-7">5.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whilst this was presented as a change, the only thing that this proposal adds to the current</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">armoury of the PCC is the power to refer the matter to the complaints arm. Lord Hunt did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dissent from that, saying<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;it&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> simple</span><span style="font-style:italic"> codification</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it&#8230;.&#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref90" href="#footnote90">90</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-8"><a href="#para5-8" name="para5-8">5.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is notable that the regulations do not appear to give the regulator the power to determine</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where an adjudication or apology should be placed. Lord Black suggested that it was possible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this could be changed but that it would be a matter for the Code Committee, subject to</span>

 <h4>Compensation</h4>

<p id="para-id-5-9"><a href="#para5-9" name="para5-9">5.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The regulator is given no powers to award compensation. The explanation for this is that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if compensation were available to complainants through the regulatory process it would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complicate the conciliation process.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref92" href="#footnote92">92</a></sup> Lord Black suggested that if the regulator were to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have the power to award compensation then complainants would always tend to want the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator to deal with their complaint rather than getting the individual publisher to deal with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it; furthermore, it is likely that the publisher would be even more defensive than presently is</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">the case.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-10"><a href="#para5-10" name="para5-10">5.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is also another substantial difficulty. Although it might be possible to specify a right</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to compensation for a breach of the code that did not involve breach of the civil law (as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can be awarded by Ombudsmen for maladministration), in the main the issues likely to lead</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to a reasonable expectation of compensation are those which give rise to a claim for civil</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">damages. If the regulator had the power to award compensation, it is likely that it would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sought as a matter of course; instead of providing what should be speedy redress by way of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apology and correction, arguments will develop about the extent of the breach and the way</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in which compensation should be approached. There is a real risk that lawyers for both sides</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would become involved, with the result that the system could collapse under its own weight.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An arbitral arm could provide swift financial redress in appropriate breaches of the civil law.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the circumstances, I am inclined to agree with Lord Black that it would be better for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints arm not to have the power to award compensation.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-11"><a href="#para5-11" name="para5-11">5.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Limiting the sanctions available to the Complaints Committee to those set out in paragraph</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">5.6 does mean that, short of legal action by a complainant, a publisher is unlikely to suffer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">financial penalties for a single abuse, no matter how egregious it might be. However, in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">event of a complaint about a particularly egregious breach of the code, it would be possible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the Complaints Committee to refer the matter to the Investigations arm, which could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then, with the approval of the Trust Board, initiate an investigation. This could culminate in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a fine if the single egregious breach were considered to demonstrate a complete failure of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">internal governance within the company.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref93" href="#footnote93">93</a></sup></span>
<h4>Contemporaneous civil proceedings</h4>

<p id="para-id-5-12"><a href="#para5-12" name="para5-12">5.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The proposal does not allow for the regulator to hear a complaint if it is the subject of current</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legal proceedings. A joint submission from ANL, GNM and TMG points out that s114 of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Broadcasting Act 1996 prevents Ofcom from considering fairness cases where the matter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is the subject of proceedings in a court of law.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref94" href="#footnote94">94</a></sup> That submission argues that the nature of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">defamation means that it is essential that both sides in a civil case should be able to argue their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case freely, and that the existence of parallel regulatory proceedings might make it difficult</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the defendants to offer a full defence because of regulatory concerns. Notwithstanding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, Lord Black conceded that there was a case for allowing the regulator to look at pure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">code or ethics issues that are unconnected to the libel proceedings whilst those proceedings</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are underway.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref95" href="#footnote95">95</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black further considered that there was nothing to stop the Complaints Committee</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considering a complaint before a libel action was brought, and went further saying that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would expect the new regulator to take the view that this could happen.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref96" href="#footnote96">96</a></sup> Lord Black also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expressed the view that a successful court action might<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;almost</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> an</span><span style="font-style:italic"> automatic</span><span style="font-style:italic"> trigger</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span></span>

<p id="para-id-5-14"><a href="#para5-14" name="para5-14">5.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I remain to be convinced that there is any particularly unique problem associated with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">defamationthatmakesitimpossibleforcourtandregulatoryactiontobetakensimultaneously.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It seems reasonable that a court should be able to stay the regulatory action if continuing it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would endanger the civil action, but that is no reason for a blanket ban on the regulator</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considering regulatory issues without waiting for any legal action to be completed first. I very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">much agree with Lord Black that a new regulator should take the view that a complainant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can bring a complaint prior to taking legal action if they so wish, and I would consider that it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be made clear in the contract and regulations that this is the case.</span>
<h4>Investigations</h4>

<p id="para-id-5-15"><a href="#para5-15" name="para5-15">5.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An investigation can be triggered by a number of events, described as<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;serious</span><span style="font-style:italic"> or</span><span style="font-style:italic"> systemic</span></span>

<h4>Process</h4>

<p id="para-id-5-16"><a href="#para5-16" name="para5-16">5.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An investigations panel, once established, would have the power to view documents and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in theory, to summon witnesses. It was accepted, however, that, whilst the power to view</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">documents could be enforced through the courts, the power to call witnesses would not be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforceable,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref99" href="#footnote99">99</a></sup> although failure on the part of a publisher to provide a witness once called for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would constitute a breach of an obligation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref100" href="#footnote100">100</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-17"><a href="#para5-17" name="para5-17">5.17</a></p>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">There can be no objection to procedural fairness, and it is right that the subject of an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation should have an appropriate opportunity to make their case and to ensure fair</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">treatment. However, the process described above appears somewhat extreme and could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be thought to give so many opportunities to the regulated entity to challenge every single</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">step so as to frustrate the investigation and make it very difficult for the regulator to reach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a conclusion, particularly if that conclusion was adverse. Lord Black defended the process,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arguing that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref110" href="#footnote110">110</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it can be overstated quite how serious an adverse finding from the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">standards and compliance panel of the new regulator would be, and therefore I think</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the regulated entity needs to be dealt with fairly and proportionately and that means</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they should have the ability to put their case at certain points during this. That would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">just seem to me to be natural equity and natural justice.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-19"><a href="#para5-19" name="para5-19">5.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He went on to say:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref111" href="#footnote111">111</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think it highly unlikely that during the course of an investigation a regulated entity</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would take every single opportunity to try to derail it, but even if it did, then the trust</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">board and the investigation and compliance panel must plough on and it will get to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the right place in the end.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-20"><a href="#para5-20" name="para5-20">5.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am not sure that this is acceptable. These provisions have obviously been drafted to take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into account the anxieties of the publishers about the implications of an investigation and I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">do, of course, recognise the need for them to have a full say in the process. However, if there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is to be any value in the investigations process, which is itself the only genuinely new part</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of this proposal from the industry, then it is essential that it should be capable of operating</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">without continually being frustrated by those subject to regulation. I do not have a particular</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view on what is the right number of opportunities for an investigated party to appeal against</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the process but I am clear that, as currently drafted, it goes too far in that direction with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the serious risk of entirely undermining that effectiveness of the investigation remit of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-21"><a href="#para5-21" name="para5-21">5.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I note that the investigations process is entirely between the regulator and the publisher.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is no role at all for the victim, or victims, of the behaviour that has given rise to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation. There is no opportunity for them to submit evidence to the investigation, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no opportunity for them to challenge the outcome of the investigation. I recognise that if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an investigation is looking at systemic failures of governance it may not be easy to identify</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the victims. There is no reason, though, why this should prevent the investigations process</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allowing a role for victims (or, at the very least an obligation on the part of the standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigator to consult the victim) where an investigation relates to one or more specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">events in relation to which victims can be identified.</span>

 <h4>Fines and Sanctions Guidance</h4>

<p id="para-id-5-22"><a href="#para5-22" name="para5-22">5.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Theregulatorhasthepowertoimposefinesandsanctions,butthismustbedoneinaccordance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the Fines and Sanctions Guidance issued by the IFB.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref112" href="#footnote112">112</a></sup> Whist it is entirely reasonable to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have fines and sanctions guidance, I am completely at a loss as to why that guidance should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be set by the industry rather than by the regulator. Lord Black did not provide any insight into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this, but pointed out that once the guidance had been incorporated into the contract the IFB</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would have no power to amend it.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref113" href="#footnote113">113</a></sup> This is a minor point, but is indicative of the extent to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which the industry has kept to itself control of the tools that the regulator has.</span>
<h4>Enforcement</h4>

<p id="para-id-5-23"><a href="#para5-23" name="para5-23">5.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As a result of the contractual nature of the proposal, the regulator has only one method of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforcement of its decisions, whether in relation to a complaint or an investigation, which is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to take action in the courts for an order for performance of the contract. There are a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of implications to this. The first, and most obvious, is the cost that the regulator would incur</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in seeking to get his decisions enforced. There will always be a matter of judgment for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator as to whether it is a good use of his resources (both in time and money) to take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proceedings. It also means that, even where a regulatory decision has been taken according</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Regulations and all possible appeal routes have been exhausted, the publisher will still</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be able to argue as to whether the fine or other decision can be properly enforced under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the contract.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref114" href="#footnote114">114</a></sup> This adds a layer of expense and complexity to the regulator&#8217;s enforcement</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">processes.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-24"><a href="#para5-24" name="para5-24">5.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is argued, rightly, that if a publisher were to fail to comply with reasonable requests from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the regulator, or with regulatory decisions, that this could lead to the opening of a full scale</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation.However,thesameconcernsapplytotheenforcementoftheoutcome,orindeed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the conduct, of any investigation. There is a risk that the proposed system could be frustrated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by a publisher who, although having joined the system, was not inclined to cooperate and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who could appeal every decision and argue every point, with the risk that the regulator would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">either have to devote a substantial amount of his resources to dealing with the problem or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">abandon the attempt to enforce decisions. This strikes me as a structural flaw in the proposal,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although I do not immediately see a way around it. A body which derived its authority from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statute or by reason of statutory underpinning would similarly be open to challenge on every</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision and might similarly face a concerted effort to frustrate its ability to make and enforce</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decisions. The contractual system does, however, provide an extra level of potential challenge</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that would not be available in a system, independently appointed, which derived a measure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of authority by law.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-25"><a href="#para5-25" name="para5-25">5.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A further point also arises, which is about the willingness of the regulator to take any action</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in court to enforce the contract. Any decision to take action against a member to compel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disclosure of documents must be approved by the Trust Board, and it seems likely that any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision with the reputational, operational and financial implications of taking legal action</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">against a member would generally be referred to the Board.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref115" href="#footnote115">115</a></sup> I have already referred to Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Black&#8217;s assertion that the complaints arm and the standards investigation arm are structurally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">shielded from the industry funding body. This is certainly true in terms of direct appointments</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">and day to day operation but the argument wears thin in relation to enforcement if the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision to enforce a judgment of the regulator sits with the Trust Board. This could be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">avoided by giving the Head of Complaints and the Head of Standards the power to take action</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">against member companies, for enforcement purposes, without reference to the Trust Board,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but it is hard to reconcile that with the Board&#8217;s overall responsibility for the regulator and, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular, its budgetary responsibilities.</span>

<h2>6. Cost</h2>

<p id="para-id-6-1"><a href="#para6-1" name="para6-1">6.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The estimated cost of the proposal is &#163;2.25m per annum, with a separate enforcement fund</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">plus set-up costs.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref116" href="#footnote116">116</a></sup> The cost of the PCC has been in the region of &#163;1.75-&#163;1.95m per annum</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in recent years.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref117" href="#footnote117">117</a></sup> The proposal is that the industry would pay the full cost of the new system,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as they currently pay the full cost of the PCC. This was presented by Lord Back as an essential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aspect of a self-regulatory system and a demonstration of the industry&#8217;s commitment to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref118" href="#footnote118">118</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-2"><a href="#para6-2" name="para6-2">6.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It was made clear by a number of witnesses that one of the keys to any independent regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system was the independence of its funding. Ofcom recommended that any system should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be based on fixed long term (three or four year) funding agreements which, once fixed, could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not then be influenced by the funding body. Others have emphasised the need for funding to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be sufficient to enable the regulator to carry out its duties effectively. I have dealt elsewhere</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with criticisms that although the PCC was funded adequately to operate the complaints and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mediation service, that funding was sufficiently limited to prevent them from exploring other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">powers, such as powers to investigate, which theoretically were open to them. Lord Black&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">model seeks to address both points.</span>
<h4>Adequacy of funding</h4>

<p id="para-id-6-3"><a href="#para6-3" name="para6-3">6.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The body described in the proposal includes the Trust Board, a Complaints Committee and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the associated complaints arm, with a full time staff, an Independent Assessor, a Head of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Standards and Compliance, with a small full time team, and a panel of experts from whom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigations panels can be drawn. The Board, the complaints arm and the Assessor will be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">funded from the main budget of &#163;2.25m. This is a larger body than the PCC because, under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC model, the Board and the Complaints Committee are the same body. Investigations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undertaken by investigations panel will be funded from the separate enforcement fund. It is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not clear whether the full time administrative staff in the standards and compliance arm will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be funded from the main budget or from the enforcement fund. If the full time staff is to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">funded from the main budget this is an expense not currently incurred under the PCC model.</span>

 <h4>The enforcement fund</h4>

<p id="para-id-6-4"><a href="#para6-4" name="para6-4">6.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The enforcement fund is set to start at &#163;100,000,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref119" href="#footnote119">119</a></sup> thereafter being supplemented by any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fines, or contributions to investigation costs, that are levied. If the permanent standards and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigations staff were to be funded from this &#163;100,000 it is hard to see how there would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be any capacity at all for ad hoc investigations; this would effectively render the standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arm irrelevant. I therefore conclude that the permanent staff will be funded from the main</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">budget, with the enforcement fund being held in reserve to pay for investigations when the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">need arises. It is suggested that, with the addition of fines and cost contributions, the size</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the enforcement fund might rise to &#163;500,000. Given that cost contributions can only at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">best replenish what has been spent on an investigation, this must mean that there is an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expectation that fines will be levied. It is not clear what is to happen to the enforcement fund</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should early investigations not result in any fines, for it is obviously quite wrong for decisions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be made about financial penalties based on the needs of the regulator rather than the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gravity of the behaviour of the regulated entity.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-5"><a href="#para6-5" name="para6-5">6.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is worth recalling that cooperation with an investigation is expected to be enforced as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a contractual obligation through the courts if necessary. The enforcement fund would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exhausted quickly should there be the need for any such enforcement action; there is a risk</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this could be exploited by a publisher who might adopt an attitude, not unknown in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">litigation, of fighting every single decision and appealing every decision until the other party</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">runs out of money. Lord Black took the optimistic view that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref120" href="#footnote120">120</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I would hope that in a system into which publishers voluntarily entered into a contract</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that they wouldn&#8217;t do that.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-6"><a href="#para6-6" name="para6-6">6.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is only a partial answer. Publishers may voluntarily enter into this agreement because of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the fear of what might happen otherwise, but the fact that these changes have explicitly only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been offered because of the threat posed by the Inquiry indicates that the proposal presented</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is not one born of conviction but of expediency. These are not changes that the industry was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">eager to make and, consequently, the idea that publishers will cooperate with investigations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because they join the system voluntarily rings rather hollow. It is not inconceivable that some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would join the system voluntarily because they can see the weaknesses in the system that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would allow them to frustrate its effective operation.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-7"><a href="#para6-7" name="para6-7">6.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When these points were put to him Lord Black effectively agreed:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref121" href="#footnote121">121</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;That may well be the case. I think we&#8217;ve tried in the best way we can to make sure</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the trust board has the powers and the money available to enforce the contract.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think it&#8217;s always going to be an issue to do with the nature of contract. If one party</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wants to grind everybody down with legal action, that is going to happen, but in any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">structure of law that&#8217;s going to be the case.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-8"><a href="#para6-8" name="para6-8">6.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The concept of providing a ring-fenced enforcement budget is a good one, but in order to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be effective it must be enough to allow the regulator to be able to undertake investigations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">even where the publisher concerned might not cooperate. A regulator who cannot afford to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">take enforcement action will lose credibility with both the industry and the public. I am not</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">well placed to say what the appropriate level of an enforcement fund should be, but what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is proposed has the appearance of a very limited and inflexible enforcement budget that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may simply be wholly inadequate to do the job in hand, with no obvious mechanism for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">addressing such difficulties if they arise.</span>
<h4>The operational budget</h4>

<p id="para-id-6-9"><a href="#para6-9" name="para6-9">6.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black stressed that the &#163;2.25m figure was an estimate. He suggested that the new</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints arm would be dealing with far fewer complaints than the PCC because improved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">governance in newspapers would lead to fewer complaints, and more of those complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that are raised would be dealt with successfully by the publisher rather than the regulator.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref122" href="#footnote122">122</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Against that I set the larger administrative role, with the need to support the Trust Board</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and a full time standards and compliance team in addition to the current PCC structure, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black&#8217;s assertions, reflected above, that the new regulator might move to adjudicate a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">higher proportion of complaints in order to ensure that a breach of standards was properly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognised and properly dealt with.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-10"><a href="#para6-10" name="para6-10">6.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black said that if there were a need for more funding then the industry would have to sit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">down with the new regulator and look at how much the elements of the new system would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cost. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref123" href="#footnote123">123</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I have no doubt that sufficient funding will be made available to the regulator to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fulfil its function.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I cannot be so sanguine. Lord Black acknowledged that the level of funding to be made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">available to the regulator was solely in the hands of the industry. The requirement to pay will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be in the contract that publishers sign with the regulatory body, but the amounts that they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pay will be fixed by the IFB. There are no requirements on the IFB to meet the needs of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator, who will have to make do with whatever is provided by the IFB. Again, my concern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is not specifically about the level of funding estimated to be required for the core operations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the regulator, but about the absence of any power on the part of the regulator to set the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">funding levels required.</span>
<h4>Independence of funding</h4>

<p id="para-id-6-11"><a href="#para6-11" name="para6-11">6.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This brings me to the most significant issue in relation to funding. Publishers will sign contracts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the regulator that bind them into the system for five years, and those contracts will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">require them to pay the fees set by the IFB. So far, so good. However, Lord Black was clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this commitment was to the principle of funding, not to any particular amount:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref124" href="#footnote124">124</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I can&#8217;t give you guarantees over a five-year period. The industry might face a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">complete economic collapse in that time. What we are doing is making a commit</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">through contracts to provide funding over a five-year period. I think it unlikely that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we would be able to actually build exact figure into that contract because of course,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the needs of the regulator may change over time.&#8221;</span>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref122" name="footnote122" title="Go back to footnote reference 122 in the text">122</a>.  pp72-73, lines 17-1,Lord Black, <em>ibid</em></p><!--footnote-->

 <p id="para-id-6-12"><a href="#para6-12" name="para6-12">6.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The effect of this proposal, therefore, is that the IFB will set the budget for the regulator on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a year by year basis. This has practical implications for the regulator, which may not be able</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to plan its operations effectively on a long term basis, but much more significantly it has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">implications for the independence of the regulator.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-13"><a href="#para6-13" name="para6-13">6.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The IFB is comprised of representatives of the industry that the regulator is regulating. It is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">easy to see how a regulator which is dependent for the next year&#8217;s funding on the goodwill</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of its regulated bodies might be expected to operate with a light touch, and to seek to avoid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conflict &#8211; particularly with those publishers who have the most influence on the IFB. I noted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">earlier that the composition and appointment processes of the IFB remain entirely opaque, so</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public will never even know who wields that influence and, therefore, who the regulator</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is most likely to want to propitiate.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-14"><a href="#para6-14" name="para6-14">6.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This direct relationship between major publishers and the core decisions over funding of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the regulator is possibly the single biggest problem with the proposal that Lord Black has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">presented. There are, of course, ways in which it could be ameliorated. A system which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">envisaged a fixed budget for the full five year term would significantly address the concerns</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the continual need for the regulator to appease his funders. A system which required</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the budgets to be set by negotiation between the regulator and the IFB would give the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator more power to articulate, and fight for, the resources he needs to do an effective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">job and to make it clear to the public if this need was not being met.</span>
<h4>Transparency of funding</h4>

<p id="para-id-6-15"><a href="#para6-15" name="para6-15">6.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A final point on funding is the extent to which it is apparent who is funding the regulatory body.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The funding of the PCC is shared between national newspapers (59.1%), regional and Scottish</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers (34.4%) and magazines (6.5%).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref125" href="#footnote125">125</a></sup> However, due to what is described as &#8216;trade</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">association politics&#8217;, Lord Black was unable to tell the Inquiry how the national newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">share of the funding is made up.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref126" href="#footnote126">126</a></sup> He indicated that there might be greater transparency on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this issue in the future, but was not able to give any guarantees.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref127" href="#footnote127">127</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is a matter for concern and I would urge those responsible to resolve the matter so that</span>

<h2>7.  Response of editors and proprietors to the PCC and  PressBoF proposals</h2>

<h3>To what extent is the industry ready to sign up to these proposals?</h3>


<p id="para-id-7-1"><a href="#para7-1" name="para7-1">7.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry sought evidence from those editors who had previously given evidence as to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the extent to which they were ready and willing, on behalf of their titles, to sign up to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposals presented by Lord Black.</span>

 <h4>Views from national newspapers</h4>

<p id="para-id-7-2"><a href="#para7-2" name="para7-2">7.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Some of the national titles have indicated a firm readiness to sign up to the proposal,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specifically the Telegraph Media Group,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref128" href="#footnote128">128</a></sup> Trinity Mirror<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref129" href="#footnote129">129</a></sup> and Associated News.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref130" href="#footnote130">130</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-3"><a href="#para7-3" name="para7-3">7.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lionel Barber, editor of the Financial Times, expressed a willingess in principle to join the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scheme, but warned that his view of the proposals might change as the details evolved:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref131" href="#footnote131">131</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I am happy to state that in broad terms I am supportive of the proposals and if the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">discussions to finalise them continue as they have to date, then I would anticipate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recommending to the FTL board that FTL becomes a signatory to the contract. I would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">add that Lord Black&#8217;s system appears to preserve the largely useful and effective</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">service of complaints handling and mediation currently carried out by the PCC.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It is important to note that Lord Black has made clear that the proposals as submitted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the Inquiry remain a draft that is subject to industry comment and which may also</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">need to evolve dependent on the recommendations in the Inquiry&#8217;s final report. As</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">such my view of the proposals may change depending on any changes made to them</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the course of future consultation. As you might expect, there is certainly some devil</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the detail to be worked out before the contract is ready for signature.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-4"><a href="#para7-4" name="para7-4">7.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Within News International there was support for the principles underpinning the proposal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but still, according to the editor of The Sunday Times, a need to sort out details:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref132" href="#footnote132">132</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I am ready to commit to the broad principles of the new contractual obligations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">though, of course, the final authorisation by News International will be made by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the News International CEO in consultation with all three Editors. Whilst there are a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">number of details about the proposal that have yet to be worked out, I am hopeful</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that all industry participants will be able to reach final agreement.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I am in principle in favour of the proposal to bind participating members of a new</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press body by contracts.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref133" href="#footnote133">133</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Sunday Times is ready to recommend in principle that the regulated entity</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(Times Newspapers Limited) enter into these contractual obligations&#8230;..There is some</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">finessing in the detail of the framework proposals still to be done which I would hope</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">can be achieved by discussion between participants.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref134" href="#footnote134">134</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">They were not able to indicate readiness to sign contracts now.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian, indicated that, if Lord Black&#8217;s proposal was adopted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">after the Inquiry, the Guardian would be prepared to sign up to such a contract, subject to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">negotiation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref135" href="#footnote135">135</a></sup> However,hewasclearthattheproposaldid not havehis unqualified support:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref136" href="#footnote136">136</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;we believe that improvements are needed including ending the role of an industry</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">funding body and strengthening the carrots and sticks for participation in a voluntary</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">system. Above all we believe that a more ambitious system is required as part of a new</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">settlement between the press and society that reflects the needs of both in today&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">world. Significantly, that would include a system of alternative dispute resolution</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that better serves complainants and publishers: strengthened protection for public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interest journalism so that the new framework encourages the best in journalism</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rather than merely protecting against the worst; and improvements to the media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">plurality framework which is not a separate issue, but lies at the very heart of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">culture, practice and ethics of the press.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-6"><a href="#para7-6" name="para7-6">7.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chris Blackhurst, editor of The Independent, said that he was broadly supportive of Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Black&#8217;s proposals, in particular in relation to the contractual basis for the relationship with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the regulator and the regulator&#8217;s investigative and fining powers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref137" href="#footnote137">137</a></sup> However, he went on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to outline three key issues on which the group would need to see more detail before being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">able to commit to enter into the new system. First, that the system proposed might not be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficiently compelling to persuade all publishers into it, and that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref138" href="#footnote138">138</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;without the complete support of at least the major publishers, the new system</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">may not have sufficient credibility in the eyes of the public and will be hamstrung</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from the outset.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, Mr Blackhurst raised a question about the appropriateness of the maximum fine</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposed and the levels at which fines were likely to be levied, and finally, he expressed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern about whether the proposed budget of &#163;2.25m was realistic and what the actual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">costs might be.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref139" href="#footnote139">139</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-7"><a href="#para7-7" name="para7-7">7.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By contrast, Northern and Shell were clear that they were not yet willing to sign up to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scheme; they had specific concerns about the proposal. The editors of The Daily Star, The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Daily Express, The Sunday Express and The Daily Star Sunday all expressed reservations about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aspects of the proposals:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref140" href="#footnote140">140</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Daily Star Newspaper is not ready or committed to sign up to the Proposals in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">their current form and in any event, this commitment can only be made at board</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">level.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Certainly any decision to sign up to a contact under which there is the potential for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">incurring fines of up to &#163;1,000,000 is a decision which would be taken by the board</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the Company.</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">In addition, I personally have concerns in respect of who will be selected to run the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">new regulatory body, how the decision will be made as to who runs it, and how</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decisions are made more generally in terms of how the body will be funded.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">And:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref141" href="#footnote141">141</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;At present, and with the Proposals in their current form, I would not be able to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recommend to the Board that The Daily Star Sunday sign up to these contractual</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">obligations contained in the Proposal for, among others, the following reasons:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Theproposalsappeartotakea&#8216;onesizefitsall&#8217;approachtothecontractualobligations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to which we would be expected to adhere. I do not think that this would be in the best</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interests of the Group titles, other national and regional newspaper titles and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that I consider the proposals as drafted do</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not appear to represent equally the interests of those in the industry;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The proposed contract and its associated penalties are too draconian. The contract</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could damage the commercial prospects and the very future of many titles that are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bound by it. For example there is no redress if a publisher believes the regulator is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">behaving ill an inappropriate manner.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Proposals do not appear to address any potential wrong doing for which there is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not a ready adequate protection in place under the law;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The proposals includes(sic) provision for the regulator to decide to carry out an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation and impose a sanction even after civil and/or criminal proceedings have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">taken place, irrespective of whether any such proceedings result in the Newspaper</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">being found liable and/or guilty.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">This list is illustrative of my concerns and is not to be considered exhaustive.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-8"><a href="#para7-8" name="para7-8">7.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Similarly, Ian Hislop, editor of Private Eye, which is not currently a member of the PCC, said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref142" href="#footnote142">142</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Private Eye is not &#8220;at present fully ready and committed&#8221; to enter into these</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contractual obligations.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He explained that, whilst he did regard the proposal as a<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;significant</span><span style="font-style:italic"> improvement&#8221;</span> on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC, his concerns with the proposal centred around the importance of independence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and impartiality of any panel or committee involved in decisions on complaints. He further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identified that none of the incentives proposed by Lord Black for membership of the new</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory body would, in fact, provide any incentive to Private Eye.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref143" href="#footnote143">143</a></sup></span>
<h4>Views from the Scottish, Welsh and regional press</h4>

<p id="para-id-7-9"><a href="#para7-9" name="para7-9">7.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Moving away from the UK national titles there is clearly much more work to be done before</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publishers are ready to sign up to the scheme. None of the Scottish, Irish, Welsh or regional</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">titles who gave evidence to the Inquiry said that they were ready to sign up to the PressBoF</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposal in its current form, though they all supported the broad principles upon which it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">based. For example, Ian Stewart, editor of the Scotsman, said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref144" href="#footnote144">144</a></sup></span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref141" name="footnote141" title="Go back to footnote reference 141 in the text">141</a>.  p3, paras 9-10, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Second-witness-statement-of-Gareth-Morgan.pdf</p><!--footnote-->

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I agree with the general thrust of Lord Black&#8217;s proposal, though I have reservations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">withregardtoitslikelycostandthebureaucraticburdenitcouldimpose.Nevertheless,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bearing in mind JP&#8217;s commitment to the PCC and its Code, I am confident that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">company will continue to support the principle of self regulation, though whether it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">will support all aspects of Lord Black&#8217;s proposals I do not know.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-10"><a href="#para7-10" name="para7-10">7.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of regional titles raised concerns about the cost, bureaucracy and other details of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black&#8217;s proposals, generally pointing out that there was a need for more clarity and more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">negotiation. For example, Anne Pickles, Associate Editor of Cumbrian News said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref145" href="#footnote145">145</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;so far as I am able to do so, I&#8217;d suggest CN would not immediately be ready to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">commit to all the specifics of Lord Black&#8217;s proposals for self-regulation. That&#8217;s not to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">say they are dismissed as wholly inappropriate or unworkable. But they do beg more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">time for careful consideration and perhaps some amendment.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Jonathan Russell, editor of the Glasgow Herald, was very supportive in principle but raised a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of concerns that would need to be resolved:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref146" href="#footnote146">146</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;As an editor, I believe the publications for which I have responsibility are ready</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and committed in principle to entering into these contractual obligations, subject</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to clarification of certain detail and any conclusions the Leveson Inquiry itself may</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reach. I also believe my view broadly reflects the attitude of Newsquest Media Group</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">as a whole.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">And:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref147" href="#footnote147">147</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;However, I do not see the system as fully developed in Lord Black&#8217;s proposals and I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">do think there will be the need for some mechanical adjustments here and there. On</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my reading of it, the framework leaves the Regulator to decide whether and what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">changes should be made, and then the Industry Funding Body has to approve them.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It puts the publishers, locked into the endless contract, at the Regulator&#8217;s mercy if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the system does not work smoothly from day one. In reality, I expect the Regulator</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">will be sensitive to concerns of this kind and will listen to us. But I have to note the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">lack of an express provision for the members themselves to propose changes without</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">actually having to terminate or threaten to terminate the contract: a safety-valve, if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you like. There is also a concern over the extra workload which may be placed on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">senior member of staff tasked with dealing with PCC issues. This cannot become more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">onerous than it currently is. On the other hand, I appreciate that the public need to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">see a strong Regulator in place, serving a set of established principles and who is not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at the beck and call of the members. I think editors like myself have to accept that this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is a leap of faith we have to make in order to win back the trust of the public.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black did not seek to consult with those blogs currently outside of the PCC so it is no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">surprise that Paul Staines (Guido Fawkes) and Camilla Wright (Popbitch) indicated that they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were not ready to join the system. Nonetheless, Ms Wright&#8217;s assessment of the proposal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offers some relevant insights into whether such a system would be likely to be welcomed by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the new internet providers such as Popbitch:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref148" href="#footnote148">148</a></sup></span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The proposal set out by Lord Black is undoubtedly a well-meaning attempt to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">provide a basis under which the major newspaper publishers, who have seemingly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on occasions ignored the already established PCC code when it suited (thus creating</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the culture, practices and ethics for which this Inquiry was established to investigate),</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">might be persuaded to follow their own code.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">As such, the proposal appears to be written by and for the vested interests of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspaper business. It appears to have almost no relevance to editors of independent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">web publishers such as myself.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Being asked, as an obvious outsider to the national newspaper industry, to sign up to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a contract whose architects and principal beneficiaries were the same media bosses</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in this gentleman&#8217;s club, undoubtedly has limited appeal. The composition of the trust</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">board and complaints committee would appear to be drawn from, and relevant to,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">national newspapers rather than digital media.&#8221;</span>
<h4>What difference would these proposals make?</h4>

<p id="para-id-7-12"><a href="#para7-12" name="para7-12">7.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry also sought the views of editors on what specific differences membership of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a system of the kind set out by Lord Black, underpinned by contractual obligations, would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">make to the culture, practices and ethics of their publications. The responses are informative.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Among the national titles, only James Harding<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref149" href="#footnote149">149</a></sup> and John Witherow<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref150" href="#footnote150">150</a></sup> from The Times and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Sunday Times, Chris Blackhurst<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref151" href="#footnote151">151</a></sup> from The Independent and Lloyd Embley<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref152" href="#footnote152">152</a></sup> from Trinity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mirror, indicated that procedural changes would be required. Not a single editor indicated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the changes would have the effect of raising standards in respect of their own publication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and most said that there would be no practical effect whatsoever:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In my first witness statement, I explained the basis upon which The Daily Express</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">operates. In light of those matters, I do not think that joining a system such as that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">described in the Proposals would make any significant difference to how The Daily</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">Express is run.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref153" href="#footnote153">153</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I would not expect that membership of a system based on contractual obligations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would have a material impact on the running of the Daily Star newspaper.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref154" href="#footnote154">154</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;As the editor of The Daily Telegraph, while there will be new requirements placed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">upon us, I do not envisage that the existence of a new self-regulatory system will have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">much practical impact upon the publication.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref155" href="#footnote155">155</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I would anticipate generally that there would be a continuation of the changes to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the culture, practices and ethics that have been occurring at newspapers over the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regime, for example, in terms of annual returns to the regulator. The bureaucratic</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">burden would not be an insuperable objection to participation in a new scheme. The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">underlying culture, practices and ethics would, most likely, remain the same.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref169" href="#footnote169">169</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The only response that suggested that any substantive change would be required was that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from Paul Staines, who runs the Guido Fawkes blog, who said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref170" href="#footnote170">170</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It would bog us down in bureaucracy by opening a channel for politically motivated</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nuisance complainants. Every single article we write that voices an opinion is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">challenged by our readers in the comments, on Twitter and via email. If we were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">obliged to respond to complainants we would be overwhelmed. It is ridiculously</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">impractical given the volume of specious complaints.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Not all blogs took the same line. Camilla Wright, editor of Popbitch, said that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> would</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span></span>

<p id="para-id-7-16"><a href="#para7-16" name="para7-16">7.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is difficult, in the light of these comments, to conclude that the press themselves believe</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the system proposed by Lord Black would drive up standards. It is true that, in all cases,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is said that there would be no impact from the proposals because the relevant title already</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">respects the PCC standards. However, in the light of the practices that have been identified by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry this view, at least in some parts of the press, must display a degree of complacency</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that argues against the prospect of real change under the proposed system.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-1"><a href="#para8-1" name="para8-1">8.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The proposal put forward by Lord Black does represent a significant improvement on the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as currently constituted and I recognise and appreciate the efforts that he and others have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gone to in order to be able to present this proposal in such detail to the Inquiry. However, this</span>

 <p id="para-id-8-2"><a href="#para8-2" name="para8-2">8.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have repeatedly made it clear that in order to be considered effective a new regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regime would have to work for the public as well as for the industry. That means that,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">besides promoting the highest professional standards of journalism and the importance in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">democratic society of free speech and freedom of expression, a new regulatory regime must</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cover all significant publishers; it must also be capable of raising standards while at the same</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">time protecting both the public interest and the rights of individuals. This proposal fails to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meet the requirement for effectiveness on two of those points.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-3"><a href="#para8-3" name="para8-3">8.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, the proposed contractual basis has some benefit in keeping publishers within the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system for a period of time once they have signed up. However, it does nothing to require</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them to sign up and the evidence before the Inquiry makes it clear that there is a substantial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">distance to go before all significant publishers could be persuaded to join the system. In those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstances it is not possible to say with any confidence that this proposal would have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficient coverage within the industry. Furthermore, I realistically have to identify that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">main incentive to any publisher to sign up to this system is the threat that the Inquiry will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommend some form of regulation that is less to their taste. Once this Report has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">published, that power to bring publishers to the table will no longer exist, so to the extent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that publishers have not yet signed contracts there can be no reliance on them ever doing so.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-4"><a href="#para8-4" name="para8-4">8.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Even if all significant publishers were to join this proposed contractual system there is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no guarantee that the system would continue to operate, or to operate at the standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">currently proposed, beyond the first five year period. In addition, titles may leave the system</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if ownership is transferred to a non-member. This does not provide sufficient long term</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stability or durability.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-5"><a href="#para8-5" name="para8-5">8.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of incentives have been proposed to entice publishers into the system and to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">keep them there. Unfortunately those incentives are very weak and it is difficult to see them</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">having any impact on a publisher who does not in any case consider membership to be in his</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-6"><a href="#para8-6" name="para8-6">8.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, the proposal is structured entirely around the interests and rights of the press,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with no explicit recognition of the rights of individuals. The system gives no rights at all to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complainants and the regulator is set up without any remit to protect the rights of third</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parties. At its heart, an effective regulator should have the interests of those likely to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">affected, alongside the interests of freedom of expression and the freedom of the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-7"><a href="#para8-7" name="para8-7">8.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A new system must have an independent process for setting fair and objective standards.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In my opinion, this proposal fails to meet that test by leaving the setting of standards in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hands of the industry, albeit with a check by the Trust Board. A relatively small change to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposal, making it clear that the Code Committee is advisory and that the Trust Board is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsible for establishing and altering the code, would go a considerable way to deal with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this concern.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-8"><a href="#para8-8" name="para8-8">8.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A new system must have an independent enforcement and compliance mechanism. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposal makes real advances under this heading. I welcome the emphasis on improving</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">internal governance within publishers. I support the proposal that complaints should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dealt with in the first instance by publishers. I endorse both the requirement for an annual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">return on compliance to the regulatory body and a named senior individual within each title</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with responsibility for compliance and standards. These are real innovations and are very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">welcome. However, the proposal still has serving editors on the body making decisions on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints and this does not provide the required degree of independence of enforcement.</span>

 <p id="para-id-8-9"><a href="#para8-9" name="para8-9">8.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I welcome the proposal for a standards and compliance arm, with both its ongoing monitoring</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">role and its ability to carry out investigations. Again, these are both real innovations and are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">much needed. However, there are substantive concerns about the ability of this part of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisation to function effectively given the procedural arrangements proposed. I am sure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this could be resolved by addressing the procedural issues, but they are not insignificant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and it would be important to have an independent review of the operation of the standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arm after a short period, say a year, to ensure that they had been addressed effectively and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to consider the possibility of making further procedural changes if they were needed.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-10"><a href="#para8-10" name="para8-10">8.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Overall, however, I have serious reservations about the independence of the appointment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">process for the Chair of the Trust, and about the role of the Industry Funding Body throughout</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this model. I believe that sufficient independence cannot be achieved while the industry has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a veto on the appointment of the Chair, has the right to define the standards and has the right</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to define the sanctions available. All these concerns could be remedied by reducing the IFB&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">role in the operation of the proposal.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-11"><a href="#para8-11" name="para8-11">8.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A new system must have the ability to offer meaningful remedies of correction and apology</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to those who have been harmed and to apply effective sanctions to those who continue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to breach standards (or fail to comply with directions as to correction and apology). The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remedies offered to individuals under the proposed system are exactly the same as those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">currently offered by the PCC, albeit with some potential improvements in transparency. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does not seem to me to be sufficient. The regulator should have the power to determine the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prominence and placing of an apology, correction or adjudication and all breaches of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">code should be identified and recorded as such, even where the publisher cooperates with a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mediated settlement.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-12"><a href="#para8-12" name="para8-12">8.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As has been made clear earlier, the creation of the investigations process is to be welcomed,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and both the investigatory powers and the range of the sanctions available do look to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potentially effective if publishers cooperate. I repeat, however, that this process cannot be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effective if it is prevented from operating by oppressive procedures; changes therefore need</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be made to ensure that this does not arise, even where a publisher might try to frustrate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the process.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-13"><a href="#para8-13" name="para8-13">8.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An effective regulatory system must be adequately financed and have sufficient independence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from its funding body to operate independently. I have significant concerns on both those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fronts in relation to this proposal. First, the sums proposed both for core funding and for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforcement fund look tight. This is particularly the case in relation to the enforcement fund</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which could easily be used up on investigations into a recalcitrant publisher. Second, the role</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Industry Funding Body throughout the proposal and the fact that the funding will not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be settled in advance for the full contract period, give far too much influence to the IFB. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is welcome that the industry is keen to fund this regulatory regime itself without input from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the taxpayer or from complainants; however, the extent to which the largest players must</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">shoulder the bulk of the burden of the cost for the good of the industry as a whole, along with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the extent to which the funding mechanism should be open and transparent, are also issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which would have to be addressed.</span>
