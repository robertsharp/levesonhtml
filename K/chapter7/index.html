<h1>CHAPTER 7<br/>CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE REGULATION OF THE PRESS</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Earlier parts of this Report have set out in considerable detail the systems currently in place</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which seek to address press standards in an attempt to support high quality journalism while</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the same time protecting the rights and interests of individuals. This has included examining</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the formal systems in place within individual titles, the informal culture and practices within</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">titles (and across the press) and the industry agreed standards as embodied in the Editors&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Code of Practice which form the standard for the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">giving advice or handling complaints. Throughout, I have drawn conclusions on the adequacy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and effectiveness of those systems.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is important to make the point, yet again, that I recognise that most of the press, most of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the time, do meet the high standards that the UK public is entitled to expect. I have explored</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">good practice in the Report,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> looking both at the generic importance of a free press and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at examples of good practice across the industry. However, when looking at whether the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards regime in place is adequate, it is important that the analysis takes account not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only of what happens most of the time but also, and critically, what the regime allows to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">happen some of the time. And there can be no doubt that, on occasion, there has been a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significant failure of standards within and across parts of the national press. To some extent,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these significant failures have been conceded by everyone: I have concluded, however, that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they are more widespread than has been universally acknowledged.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That these failures have included breach of civil rights on a substantial scale is made evident</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the civil claims that have already been settled by the News of the World (NoTW) in respect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of phone hacking. The reports of the Information Commissioner in 2006 provided prima</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">facie evidence of criminal breach of data protection legislation on behalf of journalists across</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a number of areas of the national press. And, of course, the police are still investigating a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantial number of suspected criminal offences, not just at the NoTW, but elsewhere in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News International (NI) and in some other titles.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> Arrests have been made covering unlawful</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interception of communications and payments to public officials. Some suspects have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">charged, in particular in relation to conspiracy to intercept communications without lawful</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">authority. I can obviously make no comment on these cases and do not pre judge any of them.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is, however, appropriate to observe that the fact that such a significant police investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has resulted in so many arrests and charges so far, at least gives rise to a legitimate cause for</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">concern.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The criticisms that can be levied against the press on the basis of the evidence that this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry has heard are set out elsewhere in this Report.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> My conclusions on the effectiveness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the PCC as an industry self-regulator have been dealt with earlier.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> It is abundantly clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from this that current systems of both internal governance in some parts of the press, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry self-regulation of the press, have not worked and are not working.</span>

<a name="page1748"></a><!--new page--><h3>Can the PCC continue to act as regulator?</h3>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In Chapter 1 above, I set out the criteria that I consider need to be met for a regulatory regime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be considered effective. The system operated by the PCC falls short of these criteria on a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of key points. First, it has lost credibility with the public, with politicians and with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press itself. This is not just a view that I have reached, but is shared by Lord Black in his own</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">submission to this Inquiry<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> on what the future regulatory regime should look like. On top of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, the departure of Northern and Shell from the system has shown that it is not able to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deliver complete coverage, even of the major national newspaper groups.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC lacks the independence that is critical to building public confidence in a regulator.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It has been dominated by the industry, both through the influence of the Press Board of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finance (PressBoF), particularly in relation to appointing the Chair and the press members of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Commission, and through the presence of serving editors in both the Code Committee</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and on the Commission itself.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Editors&#8217; Code, whilst widely considered both within and outside the industry as being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a good code, provides a set of general requirements. These often contain a measure of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">uncertainty over how and when they might apply. The development of the Code over the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">years has achieved a great deal. It can, however, be improved to provide a constructive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethical and legal framework within which journalists should work. In any event, compliance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with, and enforcement of, the Code has been inadequate and intermittent.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The structures and practices of the PCC have constrained it to acting as a mediator in respect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of complaints, rather than having any enforcement role that is consistent and effective. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">failure to identify any code breaches where a mediated settlement could be reached, or to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provide meaningful statistics in relation to complaints brought and how they were resolved,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">means that there is no authoritative picture of just how often breaches have occurred and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where they have occurred. The manifest failures of the PCC to take any steps to address</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the reports from the Information Commissioner and the discredited investigations and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusions by the PCC into phone hacking (since abandoned), demonstrate that the PCC,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">despite calling itself a regulator and referring to self-regulation of the industry, has not acted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as regulator of standards as opposed to a reactive case-handler.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The remedies available to the PCC have proved an inadequate deterrent to breach. Whilst the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry have shouldered the full cost of operation of the PCC, the PCC has not been provided</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the funding that it would have needed to act as a credible regulator.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-10"><a href="#para1-10" name="para1-10">1.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is clear, therefore, that continuation of the status quo is not a credible option, and no one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has suggested that it is.</span>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref5" name="footnote5" title="Go back to footnote reference 5 in the text">5</a>.  p13, para 1, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Submission-by-Lord-Black-of-Brentwood1.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1749"></a><!--new page--><a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. Options put forward </h2>

<h3>The industry proposal</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The inability of the PCC to fulfil the required role has been recognised and accepted by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry, which has put forward its own proposal for the future in the form of a submission</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from Lord Black, as the Chairman of PressBoF. That proposal is described<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> and analysed<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">earlier. As I have already said, that proposal does represent a significant improvement on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC as currently constituted and I recognise, and am grateful for, the efforts that have gone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into constructing what is intended to be a new, more independent and more effective model.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, unfortunately, although it would represent an improvement on the status quo, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aspects of the framework could be built on, I conclude that the extent of industry control</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within the proposed system is a fundamental flaw.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, the proposal does not have the clear support of any larger proportion of the industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than the current system. If the PCC is inadequate, at least in part, because a major national</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper group sits outside it, then Lord Black&#8217;s proposal must also be inadequate.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Northern and Shell has not said explicitly that it would not join the organisation if it was to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">established, but its evidence to the Inquiry is sufficiently negative to give a strong steer that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that is the case. Certainly, there must be a substantial doubt as to the ability of this proposal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to command full industry support and cooperation, and there is no sufficient mechanism for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the critical goal of full participation by all.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, the system as proposed provides no long term stability. This has two features. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">first is that a five year contract would bind members into the club for that period, but there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is no guarantee that the system would continue to operate beyond the first five year term.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second feature is that it provides no assurance that the level at which standards or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">safeguards would be set would meet the level rightly expected by the public. Or that, once</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">set, they would remain at that level. Thus, the proposal does not provide sufficient long term</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stability, durability or guarantee. That is not to say that contracts between the regulator and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the regulated entity have no role to play in a future model; it is simply the case that they do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not, on their own, provide sufficient assurance of long term effectiveness.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Third, and of critical significance, the model presented by Lord Black fails to offer genuine</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independence from the industry. The industry, primarily through the Industry Funding Body</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(IFB), would have substantial influence over the appointment of the Chair of the Trust, as well</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as having &#8216;responsibility&#8217; for the Code and having to approve any changes in the regulations.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The continuation of the Code Committee with a majority of serving editors, acting in more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than an advisory role, does not allow for independent setting of standards.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Anewsystemmusthave anindependentandeffective enforcementandcompliance mechanism.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As I have already said, I endorse the approach to internal company governance proposed by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black. In particular, I support the proposal that complaints should be dealt with in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">first instance by publishers and the requirements for an annual return on compliance to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator,andanamedseniorindividualwithineachtitlewithresponsibilityforcomplianceand</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards. These are real innovations and are welcome. However, the proposal still has serving</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editors on the body making decisions on complaints, and this does not provide the required</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">degree of independence of enforcement. The proposal for a standards and compliance arm,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with both its ongoing monitoring role and its ability to carry out investigations, is welcome,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although in practice, as currently set out by Lord Black, it could be so drawn out and so hedged</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">about with appeals that I doubt it could ever be used effectively.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref6" name="footnote6" title="Go back to footnote reference 6 in the text">6</a>.  Part K, Chapter 2</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref7" name="footnote7" title="Go back to footnote reference 7 in the text">7</a>.  Part K, Chapter 3</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1750"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A new system must have the ability to offer meaningful remedies to those who have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">harmed.ThisproposaldoesnotofferanysignificantimprovementonthecurrentPCCapproach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in this regard. It must also be able to apply effective sanctions to those who continue to breach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards: although real movement has been made in that direction, through the proposals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on investigations and the power to fine, there are serious concerns about it resulting from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">procedural complexity that is greater and more extensive (thereby causing significant delay)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than is necessary even when having full regard to the vital requirements of fairness. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">improved transparency is to be welcomed, but it is not sufficient.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, an effective regulatory system must be adequately financed and have sufficient</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independence from its funding body to operate independently. It is impossible for me to take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a view on what constitutes adequate funding given the early stage of development of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposal. What is clear, however, is that the IFB has sole discretion to decide on the funding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and this cannot give the regulator sufficient independence to carry out its role properly.</span>
<h3>Other proposals</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Many proposals, with various degrees of detail, were put forward by interested parties and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I would like to express my gratitude to all of them for the efforts that they made. These</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposals are examined in detail elsewhere.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> It is fair to say that, whilst there are many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">excellent and helpful ideas contained within those proposals (a number of which I am happy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to adopt), there are none that, on their own, sufficiently meet all the criteria that I set down.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If I am not to adopt a proposal that has been put in front of the Inquiry I must instead construct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one myself. In section 4 below, I look at what a satisfactory system must contain, but first I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">address the question of coverage.</span>

<a name="section3"></a>
<h2>3. A new system must include everyone</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A new system must be effective, and one of the key criteria of effectiveness is that it should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">include all major publishers of news (if not all publishers of newspapers and magazines).</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This has been an almost universal view from the witnesses who have given evidence to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry in relation to future regulation; they have been clear that any new system should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cover all news publishers, and that compliance with it should not be a matter of choice. There</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been a striking level of agreement between commentators, the industry and politicians</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as to the desirability of all newspapers being covered by a regulatory regime, although not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">everyone has explained how they would deliver such comprehensive coverage. The Prime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Minister, the Rt Hon David Cameron MP, said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;What we actually have to deliver is that it is compulsory and has all those things</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that I said [i.e. independence, penalties, compulsion, toughness, public confidence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and all the rest of it]&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Deputy Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Nick Clegg MP, stopped short of explicitly calling for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compulsion, but was clear that the system should include everybody:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">system altogether. You have to have buy-in from everybody.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Rt Hon Ed Miliband MP set out a number of criteria for a new body, including complete</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">coverage of the newspapers:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A new body should have: a) clear independence from those it regulates and freedom</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from political interference; b) proper investigative powers; c) an ability to enforce</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">corrections; d) a system that is focused on the needs of the public which is accessible</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for all and not available only to the rich; e) a system that applies to all newspapers.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(emphasis added)</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions considered the role that should be played by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation and said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It is essential that membership of the reformed media regulator extends to all major</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspaper publishers. It should no longer be possible for a title unilaterally to opt out</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of regulation with no sanction forthcoming.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">A previous PCC Chair, Sir Christopher Meyer told the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;No system of self-regulation can survive the wilful refusal of a major player to take</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">part. There may be a case for back-stop law or regulation making membership of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">PCC compulsory.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of commentators have pointed out that the Lord Chief Justice, in his speech last</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">newspapers.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">From within the industry there has similarly been general agreement that any system should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be comprehensive in its coverage. Thus, Paul Dacre, Editor-in-Chief of Associated Newspapers,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and editor of the Daily Mail, in his presentation to a seminar at the very beginning of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry, said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;there&#8217;s one area where Parliament can help the press. Some way must be found to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">compel all newspaper owners to fund and participate in self-regulation. God knows</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the industry fought hard enough to prevent it, but the Express group&#8217;s decision to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">leave the PCC was a body blow to the commission. How can you have self-regulation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">when a major newspaper group unilaterally withdraws from it?&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whilst he has subsequently resiled from advocating statutory intervention to achieve the goal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of comprehensive coverage, his view that all newspapers and magazines should be covered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the new regulatory system was repeated in a submission to the Inquiry in July:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I also believe absolutely that one of the main responsibilities of the new regulatory</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">system should be to ensure that the Editors&#8217; Code is followed both in spirit and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">letter by all newspapers, magazines and, importantly, their Online versions.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-10"><a href="#para3-10" name="para3-10">3.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is consistent with the approach taken by Viscount Rothermere, the current owner of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Daily Maily & General Trust, who told the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I would certainly agree that in order for self-regulation to work, I think that you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would have to have all members of the industry support it, yes. Or the defined industry</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">support it, whatever that definition was.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-11"><a href="#para3-11" name="para3-11">3.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Joint owner of Independent Print Limited, Evgeny Lebedev, told the Inquiry, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> think</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is worth noting two other, albeit contrasting, political opinions. The Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I believe we do need a new regulator- one with substantially more power and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">independence than the PCC, which failed in its previous incarnation, and no longer</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">commands the confidence of the public.&#8221;</span>

<a name="page1753"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">He went on to say that he agreed with Lord Hunt that participation of all the big players is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">highly desirable if the new system is to have meaning and said that a very difficult question</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that goes to the heart of the effectiveness of a new body is how you ensure membership of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all powerful media voices.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-13"><a href="#para3-13" name="para3-13">3.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By contrast, the Rt Hon Michael Gove MP was very cautious about any system of regulation,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expressing the concern that regulation does not always deliver the outcomes desired, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might nonetheless result in a curtailing of freedoms. He said that he was not necessarily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advocating a free-for-all, but he was clearly entirely untroubled by the thought of some, or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all, of the press existing outside of a system of standards regulation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-14"><a href="#para3-14" name="para3-14">3.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">So, with the exception of Mr Gove (although, if present press reports are correct, there are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">others), the very strong view expressed to the Inquiry by politicians in Government and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Opposition, from the victims of press abuse, from press regulators and from those at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">head of the industry itself, was that any new system of regulation should cover all significant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">news publishers, and I entirely agree.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I therefore recommend that a new system of regulation should not be considered </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">sufficiently effective if it does not cover all significant news publishers. The challenge, </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">then, is to find a way of achieving that result.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-15"><a href="#para3-15" name="para3-15">3.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first task is to look at the suggestions made by all those quoted above as to how they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would achieve full coverage of a new system. Mr Cameron was reluctant to reach for statute</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to compel regulation of press standards, but did not rule it out:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think as we go at this, we have to understand the real concern there is about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">statutory regulation. That doesn&#8217;t mean you rule it out, but it means try and make</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">everything that can be independent work before you reach for that lever. But, of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">course, if you had to undertake it, the more undertakings, the more safeguards would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">obviously be better. That would be my view.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-16"><a href="#para3-16" name="para3-16">3.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clegg identified a possible role for legislation in &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> creating</span><span style="font-style:italic"> incentives</span><span style="font-style:italic"> or</span><span style="font-style:italic"> cajoling</span><span style="font-style:italic"> all</span><span style="font-style:italic"> parts</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the media to be part of a new regulatory environment.<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> He</span><span style="font-style:normal"> did</span><span style="font-style:normal"> not</span><span style="font-style:normal"> define</span><span style="font-style:normal"> &#8216;cajoling&#8217;,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> but</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was clear that participation in the regulatory system should not be a matter of choice. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also suggested that there could be a role for a statutory backstop co-regulator,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup> but did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">develop the idea in detail.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-17"><a href="#para3-17" name="para3-17">3.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Miliband did not explain how his vision for a new form of press regulation should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">delivered, but the Rt Hon Harriet Harman MP, on behalf of the Labour Party, proposed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;statutory support&#8217; for a new regulatory body both in providing for its independence and to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions recommended that the industry should adopt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the proposals then being promoted by Lord Hunt (which subsequently formed the basis of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black&#8217;s proposals to the Inquiry) and that a standing commission comprised of both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Houses of Parliament should be established to scrutinise the process of reform.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup> However,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Committee was clear that this might not be sufficient and concluded:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;However, should the industry fail to establish an independent regulator which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">commands public confidence, the Government should seriously consider establishing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">some form of statutory oversight. This could involve giving Ofcom or another body</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">overall statutory responsibility for press regulation, the day-to-day running of which it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could then devolve to a self-regulatory body, in a similar manner to the arrangements</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for regulating broadcast advertising.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Committee also recommended that &#8216;significant penalties&#8217; should be imposed on news</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publishers who are not members of the reformed media regulator, although the only example</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they offered was that advertisers should refuse to advertise in non-member publications.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;a statutory mechanism could be established to ensure that [their recommended</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">requirements] are met by the new regime whilst guaranteeing that the regulator</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could not be misused by politicians to interfere with media&#8217;s legitimate right to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">freedom of expression.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-20"><a href="#para3-20" name="para3-20">3.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Lord Chief Justice stopped short of saying from where the &#8216;new PCC&#8217; should derive its</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Hunt was very clear that he did not regard it as appropriate to use legislation to secure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">full participation in a regulatory regime. However, he did not offer any means of doing so,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other than a general reference to the incentives suggested as part of Lord Black&#8217;s proposal.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Christopher accepted that there might be a case for backstop law or regulation making</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Lebedev said that self-regulation was preferable to statutory regulation, but that he was:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;not averse to statutory backstop, because I think there needs to be a way of making</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;it may be a question of a stronger enshrining of speech rights on the one hand,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">coupled with a stronger set of consequences and either a self-regulating body or a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">statutory body that includes the press but also individuals that are not part of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">working press today.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-26"><a href="#para3-26" name="para3-26">3.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke did not offer a particular prescription but said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I am not convinced, though, that a statutory underpinning of some kind would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">amount to state control of the press. You have pointed out the statutory duty of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Lord Chancellor to uphold the independence of the judiciary. I would note as well</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that press organisations have a legal obligation to register with Companies House</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and HM Revenue and Customs as businesses; this doesn&#8217;t appear to me to amount</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to political interference in their work. This is not my endorsement necessarily for a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">statutory backing, but simply an observation that it would not be the freedom of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expression Armageddon some commentators would have you believe. I am attracted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the idea of contracts, with the possibility (hopefully never used) of civil litigation if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the contracts are broken.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-27"><a href="#para3-27" name="para3-27">3.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">So, in summary, whilst there is limited enthusiasm for statutory provision to ensure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">comprehensive coverage of a regulatory regime, there is widespread recognition that statute</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may be the only way of delivering this goal. Those who shy away from statute have found</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nothing of substance to offer as an alternative means of ensuring that their own objective of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all industry buy-in can be achieved. A number of incentives to membership of a regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system have been put forward. These have been analysed elsewhere<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup> and I have concluded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that only a few of them are capable of having some effect, and those are included in my</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations below. I hope, and believe, that these incentives will send a powerful</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">message to publishers that it is in their own interests to be a part of a system such as the one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that I am recommending, but it cannot be guaranteed that they will all agree.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am firmly of the view that the goal here is voluntary independent self-regulation, and I set</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out below my own prescription for what that must look like in order for it to deliver what the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public wants, and is entitled to want, in respect of independence and respect for individual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rights and interests. I believe that the model that I set out has real and significant benefits for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public and for the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-29"><a href="#para3-29" name="para3-29">3.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, I must also recognise the risk that some publishers would choose to stay outside</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such a system, or even that the industry might not be able to secure agreement to establish</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such a system. Much as I hope this is not the case, as described earlier,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup> the history of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns about press behaviour, and the press and Government response to those concerns,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has demonstrated that the industry has only ever offered what could be described as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">small incremental improvements to its system of self-regulation, even though its model (as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">modified) has been shown, time after time, not to be sufficient to address public concerns.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Indeed, it is highly relevant that the most significant argument advanced for allowing self-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation a further &#8216;last chance&#8217; is that, in truth, the PCC never was a regulator (even though</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that is precisely what it was intended and purported to be). Whatever might now be said, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was intended to be sufficiently robust to address the problems identified by Sir David Calcutt QC.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-30"><a href="#para3-30" name="para3-30">3.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is evidence, therefore, that, left to itself, the press response to public concern this time</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would, in reality, be little different: although there are some new ideas, a full analysis of Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Black&#8217;s proposal may, indeed, support that conclusion. As I have said, I very much hope that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this time the industry and the Government will rise to the challenge and create a genuinely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effective system of independent self-regulation, but I would be failing in my duty to the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if I did not address the consequences if that were not to happen.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-31"><a href="#para3-31" name="para3-31">3.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is likely that, were the industry to fail to deliver what is needed, the Government would face</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">entirely appropriate pressure from the public, who would be entitled to demand that some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">action be taken to ensure that the press is accountable and that there was an acceptable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">answer to the question &#8220;Who guards the guardians?&#8221; Indeed, it is clear that there have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">two opinion polls published recently that suggest quite a strong public demand for effective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">action in this area.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-32"><a href="#para3-32" name="para3-32">3.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are a number of options which I set out in the next Chapter. I readily accept that there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may be many different views on which would be the most appropriate, and I do not intend</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to make a firm recommendation on this matter as an answer is not needed unless or until</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the industry fail to deliver effective independent self-regulation. Furthermore, if I make a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendation in this area, press attention will move from the detailed proposal that I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">make to the industry and focus on this recommendation alone.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-33"><a href="#para3-33" name="para3-33">3.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having said that, it would equally be wrong if I did not make it clear that, if some or all of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry are not willing to participate in effective independent regulation, my own concluded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view is to reject the notion that they should escape regulation altogether. I cannot, and will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not, recommend another last chance saloon for the press.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">With some measure of regret, therefore, I am driven to conclude that the Government should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be ready to consider the need for a statutory backstop regulator being established, to ensure,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the least, that the press are subject to regulation that would require the fullest compliance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the criminal and civil law, if not also to ensure consequences equivalent to those that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would flow from an independent self-regulatory system.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">I repeat, again, that I do not, at the moment, recommend any statutory backstop and to assert</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that I do will be to distort this Report and the clear recommendations that I do make. I hope</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the industry will be able to see the value of what I have proposed and come together</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to participate in it. If they do, nothing further would be necessary. Further, I do not suggest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that a backstop regulator should be the starting point for any discussion of the way forward</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, in particular, for the legislation that I do propose. But, having said that, I have equally no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">doubt that there needs to be clarity and that it should not be possible for the industry (and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in particular, those who have a powerful voice in the industry), either in whole or in part, to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">choose not to engage with independent regulation.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Baroness O&#8217;Neill, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge, commented that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed a lot of misuse of the phrase &#8220;independent regulation&#8221; for what is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">actually self-interested regulation. So what we need first to do is to get away from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">that&#8230;&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This identifies the problem rather well. What is required is independent self-regulation. By</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">far the best solution to press standards would be a body,<span style="font-weight:bold"> established and organised by the </span></span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">industry<span style="font-weight:normal"> ,</span><span style="font-weight:normal"> which</span><span style="font-weight:normal"> would</span><span style="font-weight:normal"> provide</span><span style="font-weight:normal"> genuinely</span><span style="font-weight:normal"> independent</span><span style="font-weight:normal"> and</span><span style="font-weight:normal"> effective</span><span style="font-weight:normal"> regulation</span><span style="font-weight:normal"> of</span><span style="font-weight:normal"> its</span><span style="font-weight:normal"> members</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and would be durable. If such a body were to be established, and were to command the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">support of all key players in the market, there would be no need for further intervention,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although I believe that there would remain a need for some further support in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ensuring that independence and providing incentives for membership.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref44" name="footnote44" title="Go back to footnote reference 44 in the text">44</a>.  I have been particularly interested in the informal advice of the relevant expert Assessors in framing and<span style="font-size: 12px;"> draftingthe detail of the recommendations set out in this Chapter. All the relevant Assessors have clearly advised that thesystem I am recommending, organised by the industry to objective standards, delivers the independent regulationwhich is essential; it safeguards press freedoms, will not chill investigative journalism that is in the public interest, andcan command public confidence. It is their unanimous advice that it is in the interests of both the industry and theGovernment to accept and implement the recommendations to that end. For completeness, I have recorded one pointof detail, relating to how an industry body is recognised, on which Shami Chakrabarti gave me different advice: seepara 6.23 and footnote 56. As for the matters addressed in the next Chapter, two of the Assessors (Elinor Goodmanand George Jones) advised that it was not necessary for me to make a recommendation about what to do in the eventof the press not accepting the preferred option as they believe that independent self-regulation is the best solutionand that, if the industry considers it carefully, it too will agree. I also record that Shami Chakrabarti advised against thecontemplation of any element of compulsory backstop standards regulation of the press in the event of the inability orunwillingness of the press to implement the recommendations in this Chapter; she would prefer in that event to seea strengthening of the financial assistance available to those who feel their rights have been abused by the press inorder to help them defend those rights in court.</span></p><!--footnote-->

<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is important to be clear about what I mean by &#8216;genuinely independent and effective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation&#8217;. My criteria for an effective regulatory regime set the broad framework. What</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I will do now is set out at a level of detail the minimum criteria that I believe it would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary to have in place in order to deliver against that broad framework.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In summary, I envisage that the industry should come together to create, and adequately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fund, an independent regulatory body, headed by an independent Board, that would: set</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards, both by way of a code and covering governance and compliance; hear individual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints against its members about breach of its standards and order appropriate redress;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">take an active role in promoting high standards, including having the power to investigate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">serious or systemic breaches and impose appropriate sanctions; and provide a fair, quick</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and inexpensive arbitration service to deal with any civil complaints about its members&#8217;</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">independent Board. In order to ensure the independence of the body it is essential </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">to ensure that the Chair and members of the Board are appointed in a genuinely </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">open,  transparent  and  independent  way,  without  any  influence  from  industry  or </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">Government. </span>

<p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further, in order to ensure the independence of the body, the Chair of the Board should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clearly and demonstrably independent of the press. By that I mean that he or she should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have no current, or recent, affiliation with any particular press organisation. He or she should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">certainly be committed to freedom of expression and freedom of speech, but that must be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matched by a commitment to uphold the rights of others and to the need to provide an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate balance in a democratic society in precisely the way that Articles 8 and 10 of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) identify that balance. The Chair of the Board</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">should also be independent of any political party.</span>
<a name="page1759"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-4-7"><a href="#para4-7" name="para4-7">4.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The independence of the appointment process is important and by no means trivial. There</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are a number of specific criteria which I believe should be met in relation to the Chair of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Board.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that, first, the appointment should be made by an appointment panel. </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">The selection of that panel must itself be conducted in an appropriately independent </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">way and must, itself, be independent of the industry and of Government.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Without being prescriptive, it could include distinguished public servants with experience of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">senior independent appointments such as the Commissioner for Public Appointments and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Chair of the Judicial Appointments Commission.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-8"><a href="#para4-8" name="para4-8">4.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The body (and the Chair that leads it) will have the task of setting and enforcing standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the press, specifically balancing the interests of freedom of speech and the interests of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals; there are not many more important balances to be struck. In order to ensure that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the full complexity of the task is taken into account by the appointment panel, it is essential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the appointment panel should be capable of balancing the public interest in freedom of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">speech and the protection of privacy and should be free of political influence.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that the appointment panel:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(a)  should be appointed in an independent, fair and open way;</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(b)  should  contain  a  substantial  majority  of  members  who  are  demonstrably </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">independent of the press;</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(c)  should include at least one person with a current understanding and experience </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">of the press;</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(d)  should include no more than one current editor of a publication that could be a </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">member of the body.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-9"><a href="#para4-9" name="para4-9">4.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I do not intend to say more about the appointing panel. It is critically important that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry, in a fair and open way, get together to identify independently minded people in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whom the public can have confidence to make up the appointing panel. It will then be the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">task of that body to find and appoint a Chair who demonstrably meets the criteria of fair</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">minded and balanced independence to which I have referred. In doing so, the industry will be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">committing itself to organising independent regulation.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-10"><a href="#para4-10" name="para4-10">4.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of equal importance is the fact that the Board itself must be independent of the press, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficiently expert to ensure that regulatory decisions are appropriate, proportionate and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practical.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I  recommend  that  the  appointment  of  the  Board  should  also  be  an  independent </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">process,  and  the  composition  of  the  Board  should  include  people  with  relevant </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">expertise. The requirement for independence means that there should be no serving </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">editors on the Board.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As with the appointment panel, it is essential that the Board should be capable of balancing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public interest in freedom of speech and the protection of privacy and should be free of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political influence.</span>

<a name="page1760"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I  recommend  that  the  members  of  the  Board  should  be  appointed  by  the  same </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">appointment panel that appoints the Chair, together with the Chair (once appointed), </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">and should:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(a)  be appointed by a fair and open process;</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(b)  comprise a majority of people who are independent of the press;</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(c)  include a sufficient number of people with experience of the industry who may </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">include former editors and senior or academic journalists;</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(d)  not include any serving editor; and</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(e)  not include any serving member of the House of Commons or any member of </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">the Government.</span>

<h3>Membership</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-11"><a href="#para4-11" name="para4-11">4.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ideally the body would attract membership from all news and periodical publishers, including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">news publishers online. It is important for the credibility of the system, as well as for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">promotion of high standards of journalism and the protection of individual rights, that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body should have the widest possible membership among news providers. Clearly this will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be unlikely to include broadcasters who are already covered by the Broadcasting Code. It has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been accepted that, although I am very anxious that it remain voluntary, it must involve all the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">major players in the industry, that is to say, all national newspaper publishers and their online</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">activities, and as many regional and local newspaper publishers, and magazine publishers, as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">possible. This is not meant to be prescriptive at the very small end of the market: I would not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessarily expect very small publishers to join the body, though it should be open to them to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">do so on appropriate terms. Having said that, however, I have no doubt that there would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advantages in doing so. Ideally it would also include those who provide news and comment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">online to UK audiences.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-12"><a href="#para4-12" name="para4-12">4.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I recognise that most blogs have very different processes, audiences and business models</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to most newspapers, and that consequently it may be difficult to establish one set of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requirements, for example in respect of internal governance, annual reporting or membership</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fees, that is appropriate for all different types of publisher. It is important, however, that all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">types of publishers should be able to join such a body, and to do so on terms that are not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">manifestly inappropriate for their business model.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-13"><a href="#para4-13" name="para4-13">4.13</a></p>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I therefore recommend that membership of the body should be open to all publishers </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">on  fair,  reasonable  and  non  discriminatory  terms,  including  making  membership </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">potentially available on different terms for different types of publisher.</span>

<h3>Funding</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-14"><a href="#para4-14" name="para4-14">4.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The industry, through Lord Black, has made a principled point that the industry should fund</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">self-regulation without requiring input from the public purse. Certainly, I agree that any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry established independent regulatory body must be funded by its members. There</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are, however, some important points to be made about funding. The body will only be able</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to do what it is funded to do. If it is to be genuinely independent in operational and strategic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terms, it must have both some certainty and some influence over the level of its funding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">across a reasonable period. Practice in the industry has been for an industry body (PressBoF)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to set, and levy, the membership fees for self-regulation. In my opinion there is no need for</span>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref47" name="footnote47" title="Go back to footnote reference 47 in the text">47</a>.  This is equally apparent from an analysis of the evidence quoted at 3.1-3.13 above</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1761"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">such a body to exist at all: it would be perfectly possible for the regulator to set its own fees</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and collect them directly from its members, taking account of the financial position of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry. Equally, however, there is not necessarily any problem of principle with an industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body acting as a coordinator.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-15"><a href="#para4-15" name="para4-15">4.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However the fees are set and collected, the Board should establish the budget that it requires</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in order to carry out its functions effectively, and fees should be levied accordingly. As I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identified earlier, two issues arise in relation to independence of funding. One is the absolute</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">level of funding, and the other is security of funding over a reasonable planning period. Both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are important if the regulator is not to be at risk of being effectively held to ransom by its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">funding members.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-16"><a href="#para4-16" name="para4-16">4.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I recognise that it is not appropriate that the regulator should have a blank cheque, anymore</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than that the industry should have a strangle-hold on the regulator&#8217;s budget. In practice, if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the regulator is too expensive, publishers will not join.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that funding for the system should be settled in agreement between the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">industry and the Board, taking into account the cost of fulfilling the obligations of the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">regulator and the commercial pressures on the industry (which are not as great for </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">a number of the larger publishers as they are for the smaller, regional press). There </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">should be an indicative budget that the Board certifies is adequate for the purpose. </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">Funding settlements should cover a four or five year period and should be negotiated </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">well in advance. </span>

<p id="para-id-4-17"><a href="#para4-17" name="para4-17">4.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I recognise that the start-up costs of such a body may be significant and those putting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">together such a proposal may need to look for sources of funding to help to cover some of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those costs. In this context I do not believe it to be unreasonable for some public funding to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be made available to facilitate the establishment of a satisfactory, genuinely independent,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press regulatory body.</span>

<h3>Standards code</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-18"><a href="#para4-18" name="para4-18">4.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The new regulatory regime must have a standards code. The current Editors&#8217; Code has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">widely praised by those in the industry. It has been developed by the industry over the last</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">two decades and has adapted to take account of new concerns and issues that have arisen. I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have made no attempt during the course of this Inquiry to conduct a full scale evaluation of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Code of Practice. My role is to make recommendations for an effective and independent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">structure for setting and enforcing standards, not to set those standards. That is properly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a role for the independent regulatory body, in consultation with the industry and with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wider public. Where comments on, or criticisms of, the Code have been made in evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have reflected them in this report, but that should not be read as an analysis of the Code.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-19"><a href="#para4-19" name="para4-19">4.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, there are a few general points I would like to make about the contents of the Code.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, if the Code is to provide an ethical framework for editors and journalists to work within,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then it is important that it should set the ethical and legal context within which it applies, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seek to provide some positive depiction of ethical journalism. Second, it is important that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Code should be clear and practical. Clauses that are either impossible to comply with (as the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry has been told is the case with clause 1(iii) relating to the separation of opinion and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fact) or that are not entirely clear as to their intention and effect, will serve only to bring the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Code itself into disrepute and disuse.</span>
<a name="page1762"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-4-20"><a href="#para4-20" name="para4-20">4.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both of these points (along with some of the academic comment that was offered to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry) suggest that the current Code would benefit from a thorough review, with the aim</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of developing a clearer statement of the standards expected of editors and journalists. Thus,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if, for example, the present formulation relating to the separation of opinion and fact does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not work, a reconsideration of the wrong being targeted might lead to that concern being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">addressed in a different way. In structural terms, whilst it is of course essential that editors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should take pride in their Code, and that it should be thoroughly grounded in real world</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">current experience of the industry, it cannot be right that the standards to which the industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are to be held are set without independent oversight.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-21"><a href="#para4-21" name="para4-21">4.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In order for the new regulatory regime to have the independence required to secure public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">trust and confidence, it is essential that it should be the regulator who approves a code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of standards to which members must adhere. The Board could well be advised by a Code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Committee including serving editors and journalists, but with independent members as well:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indeed, I can see no reason why the Code Committee in the amended form as proposed by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black should not be constituted as a formal advisory body to the Board.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that the standards code must ultimately be the responsibility of, and </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">adopted  by,  the  Board  advised  by  a  Code  Committee  which  may  comprise  both </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">independent members of the Board and serving editors. </span>

<p id="para-id-4-22"><a href="#para4-22" name="para4-22">4.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As a further step to secure public confidence, it appears to me that it would be valuable if the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Board was to satisfy itself that the proposed Code had been subjected to public consultation,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">albeit on the basis that the Code Committee would then analyse the result of any consultation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and provide the Board with the benefit of its experience on issues that might have arisen.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thus the Code would command the confidence of both the public and the industry.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-23"><a href="#para4-23" name="para4-23">4.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As I have said above, I have no particular desire to comment on the actual content of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Code. It is both important and appropriate, however, that I make some recommendations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the scope and coverage of the Code. The Code will be the document that articulates</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the nature of the boundaries between journalism, its subjects and its readers. As such it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">essential that it fully reflects the interests of all three.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I  therefore  recommend  that  the  Code  must  take  into  account  the  importance  of </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">freedom of speech, the interests of the public (including the public interest in detecting </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">or exposing crime or serious impropriety, protecting public health and safety and </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">preventing  the  public  from  being  seriously  misled)  and  the  rights  of  individuals. </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">Specifically, it must cover standards providing for:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(a)  conduct, especially in relation to the treatment of other people in the process </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">of obtaining material; </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(b)  appropriate  respect  for  privacy  where  there  is  no  sufficient  public  interest </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">justification for breach; and</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(c)  accuracy, and the need to avoid misrepresentation.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-24"><a href="#para4-24" name="para4-24">4.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Code must set out a clear picture of how good journalism serves the public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the implications that has for journalistic behaviour. The Inquiry has heard that different</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editors have different views on what constitutes the public interest, and that may well be the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case. The Code will have to take a sufficiently broad approach to encompass the different</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">views and different perspectives of different types of journalism. However, the regulator,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">when applying the Code, will have to adopt a consistent interpretation of the public interest.</span>
<a name="page1763"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">If an editor can create his own definition of the public interest without any constraint then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the standards will be meaningless. The regulator, alongside the Code, must provide guidance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the interpretation of the public interest that justifies what otherwise would constitute</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a breach of the Code and must do so in the context of the different provisions of the Code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so that the greater the public interest, the easier it will be to justify what might otherwise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be considered as contrary to standards of propriety. That guidance should be available for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editors and journalists to use when making day-to-day decisions, and should also be the basis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of decisions taken on complaints about breach of the Code.</span>

<h3>Organisational requirements</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-25"><a href="#para4-25" name="para4-25">4.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The concerns about press standards that the Inquiry has heard about give rise to equivalent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns about governance, across some parts of the press, in relation to internal procedures</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for dealing with complaints and ensuring legal and standards compliance. An effective new</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory regime should address these internal governance issues. It is important that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">companies should take responsibility for their own compliance with the standards that they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sign up to. I do not expect the regulator necessarily to define the governance processes that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">member companies should adopt, though it may choose to set principles. However:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I do recommend that the Board should require of those who subscribe, appropriate </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">internal  governance  processes,  transparency  on  what  governance  processes  they </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">have in place, and notice, of any failures in compliance, together with details of steps </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">taken to deal with failures in compliance.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-26"><a href="#para4-26" name="para4-26">4.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Publishers should have adequate (and timely) processes in place for dealing with complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from readers and members of the public about breach of standards. It is absurd that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complainants should be encouraged to take their complaints to a regulatory body instead of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the company concerned seeking, in the first instance, to deal with the complaint themselves.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Taking a complaint to the regulator should be the last step, not the first.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I  recommend  that  the  Board  should  require  all  those  who  subscribe  to  have  an </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">adequate and speedy complaint handling mechanism; it should encourage those who </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">wish to complain to do so through that mechanism and should not receive complaints </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">directly unless or until the internal complaints system has been engaged without the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">complaint being resolved in an appropriate time.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-27"><a href="#para4-27" name="para4-27">4.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is already generally accepted that the editor of a newspaper is ultimately responsible for all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that happens within it. That must be true, and it must be accepted and acted on at a practical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">level. Editors must, as a matter of course, accept personal responsibility, not only for every</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">word printed in their paper but also for the methods by which information is gathered, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">judgments made about intrusion into private matters and the culture that operates in their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newsrooms.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-28"><a href="#para4-28" name="para4-28">4.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I note that the proposals put forward by Lord Black cover very similar ground in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">internal governance and accountability. The proposals he makes in respect of the requirement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for an effective in-house complaint system, an annual compliance return to the regulator</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and having a nominated senior individual with responsibility for compliance, are entirely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consistent with my recommendations here. As for the complications of compliance for small</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers, there is no reason why this responsibility should not either be officially delegated</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to someone with other duties (provided that, in this context, they are required demonstrably</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to act independently of management) or, alternatively, a group of papers could combine to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">make a single appointment: I am not seeking to be dogmatic as to how the aim is achieved.</span>
<a name="page1764"></a><!--new page--><h3>Powers</h3>
<h4>Complaints</h4>

<p id="para-id-4-29"><a href="#para4-29" name="para4-29">4.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In order to be effective the regulatory body must have appropriate powers. There are two</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different aspects to the powers that the body should have: first, it needs to have the right</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">powers to deal appropriately with individual complaints about breach of the code; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">second, it needs to have the right powers to deal with serious or systemic standards failure.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-30"><a href="#para4-30" name="para4-30">4.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Looking first at dealing with complaints:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that the Board should have the power to hear and decide on complaints </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">about breach of the standards code by those who subscribe. The Board should have </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">the power (but not necessarily in all cases, depending on the circumstances, the duty) </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">to hear complaints whoever they come from, whether personally and directly affected </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">by the alleged breach, or a representative group affected by the alleged breach, or a </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">third party seeking to ensure accuracy of published information. In the case of third </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">party complaints the views of the party most closely involved should be taken into </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 16px;">account.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Board will need to have the discretion not to look into complaints if they feel that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaint is without justification, is an attempt to argue a point of opinion rather than a code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breach or is simply an attempt to lobby, but they should, as a matter of principle, have the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">power to take up any complaint that is brought to them.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-31"><a href="#para4-31" name="para4-31">4.31</a></p>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that decisions on complaints should be the ultimate responsibility of </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">the Board, advised by complaints handling officials to whom appropriate delegations </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">may be made.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not for me to make specific organisational recommendations about how the body should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be structured or the mechanism whereby disputes might be capable of resolution. There is,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">however, no reason why the Board should not establish a small complaints committee to deal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with complaints in the first instance.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-32"><a href="#para4-32" name="para4-32">4.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having said that, it is necessary to add that it is absolutely clear to me that it is unacceptable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to have serving editors playing any role in determining the outcome of individual complaints.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that serving editors should not be members of any Committee advising </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">the Board on complaints and any such Committee should have a composition broadly </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">reflecting that of the main Board, with a majority of people who are independent of </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">the press.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whatever arrangements are put in place for the practical handling of complaints, ultimately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decisions must be a matter for the Board.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-33"><a href="#para4-33" name="para4-33">4.33</a></p>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that it should continue to be the case that complainants are able to </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">bring complaints free of charge.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is one of the best features of the existing PCC system, which is carried over to Lord Black&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposal for the future.</span>

<a name="page1765"></a><!--new page--><h4>Standards</h4>

<p id="para-id-4-34"><a href="#para4-34" name="para4-34">4.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Turning now to serious and systemic concerns, it is essential that the body should have the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">power to act as a regulator.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">Consequently, I recommend that the Board, being an independent self-regulatory </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">body should have authority to examine issues on its own initiative and have sufficient </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">powers to carry out investigations both into suspected serious or systemic breaches </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">of the code and failures to comply with directions of the Board. Those who subscribe </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">must be required to cooperate with any such investigation.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Again, it is unnecessary for me to make detailed recommendations on structures, but those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">carrying out investigations must have sufficient relevant experience and expertise and be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">demonstrablyindependentofthepress.LordBlack&#8217;sproposalmeetsmanyoftherequirements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">set down here, but I have already made clear my concerns that this aspect of Lord Black&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposal is so weighed down with process that it is difficult to see how the investigative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">powers could ever be used successfully. The new regulatory body must be able to undertake</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigations when and where it thinks appropriate, and to rely on the cooperation of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">members. The investigation process must be simple and credible and, while I recognise the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">need for a level of reconsideration (whether by appeal or otherwise), this should be only at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significant stages in order to ensure that the process can be operated effectively: ultimately,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any decision is ultimately amenable to judicial review.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-35"><a href="#para4-35" name="para4-35">4.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The new regulatory body should, as the PCC currently does, act on behalf of individuals to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ask the press to stay away when requested to do so, and may choose to provide an advisory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">service to editors in relation to consideration of the public interest in taking particular actions.</span>
<h3>Remedies and sanctions</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-36"><a href="#para4-36" name="para4-36">4.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the same way as with powers, this section breaks down in to two parts: the first relates to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the remedies that the regulator can award to individuals in relation to breaches of standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that have affected them, and the second relates to the sanctions that the regulator should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">able to impose in relation to breaches of standards.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that the Board should have both the power and a duty to ensure that all </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">breaches of the standards code that it considers are recorded as such and that proper </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">data is kept that records the extent to which complaints have been made and their </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">outcome; this information should be made available to the public in a way that allows </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">understanding of the compliance record of each title. </span>

<p id="para-id-4-37"><a href="#para4-37" name="para4-37">4.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the first case of complaints:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that the Board should have the power to direct appropriate remedial </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">action  for  breach  of  standards  and  the  publication  of  corrections  and  apologies. </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">Although remedies are essentially about correcting the record for individuals, the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">power  to  require  a  correction  and  an  apology  must  apply  equally  in  relation  to </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">individual  standards  breaches  (which  the  Board  has  accepted)  and  to  groups  of </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">people (or matters of fact) where there is no single identifiable individual who has </span>

<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">been affected.</span>
<a name="page1766"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">It should, of course, be the subject of discussion between the complainant and the title but,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the end:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that the power to direct the nature, extent and placement of apologies </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">should lie with the Board.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-38"><a href="#para4-38" name="para4-38">4.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Turning to the second case:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I  recommend  that  the  Board  should  have  the  power  to  impose  appropriate  and </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">proportionate sanctions (including financial sanctions up to 1% of turnover, with a </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">maximum of &#163;1million),<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup>  on any subscriber found to be responsible for serious or </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">systemic breaches of the standards code or governance requirements of the body. </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">The sanctions that should be available should include power to require publication </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">of corrections, if the breaches relate to accuracy, or apologies if the breaches relate </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">to  other  provisions  of  the  code.  Financial  sanctions  should  be  appropriate  and </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">proportionate.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-39"><a href="#para4-39" name="para4-39">4.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is important that the existence and use of financial sanctions should be transparent, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">order to encourage effective compliance with the system. It is equally important to consider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what would happen to any financial penalties levied. In a statutory regulatory system such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">penalties would be paid into the consolidated fund. This is obviously inappropriate in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case of a self-regulatory body. However, if the body were to be able to draw on fines to meet</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its ongoing costs there would be an inappropriate incentive on the body to levy fines. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">solution proposed by Lord Black is that a ring-fenced enforcement fund should be established,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with fines being used only to finance investigations into systemic or significant breaches. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach seems to me to be an acceptable way of dealing with the issue.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-40"><a href="#para4-40" name="para4-40">4.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For the avoidance of doubt:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that the Board should not have the power to prevent publication of any </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">material, by anyone, at any time although (in its discretion) should be able to offer </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">a service of advice to editors of subscribing publications relating to code compliance </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">which  editors,  in  their  discretion,  can  deploy  in  civil  proceedings  arising  out  of </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">publication.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In that way, there is potentially the opportunity for the regulatory body, should the need arise,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to give reasoned opinions on issues brought to them by editors, or by individuals concerned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about potential publication of a matter, that might provide explanation and context and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thereby assist the court in any subsequent consideration of the matter.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-41"><a href="#para4-41" name="para4-41">4.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Any material that generates a greater practical understanding of the approach to decisions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made by editors and the constraints under which they are made is likely to help and I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">little doubt that, if that context is provided by an independent regulator, it will carry real</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">weight. In that way, it could help to shape the way that the courts apply the law in these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cases. Given the often voiced concerns about the willingness of courts to grant injunctive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relief, supportive context in this area might help both claimants and publishers better to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understand context and be better able to reach a fair and balanced solution to the issue of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">injunctive relief then being argued. Independent focus on the balance between Articles 8 and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">10 can only assist the thinking of all.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref48" name="footnote48" title="Go back to footnote reference 48 in the text">48</a>.  These are the amounts suggested by Lord Black in his proposal, p12, paras 2.1-2,2, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Lord-Black-of-Brentwood-Annex-C1.pdf. There is some disagreement in the industryabout whether these limits are equitable and reasonable: in setting up the regulator, that would be an issue that would have to be addressed.</p><!--footnote-->

<a name="page1767"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-4-42"><a href="#para4-42" name="para4-42">4.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is essential for the public confidence in the system that the Board should regularly publish</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information on the performance of the regulatory body and on the compliance records of its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subscribers.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I therefore recommend that the Board should publish an Annual Report identifying:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(a)  the  body&#8217;s  subscribers,  identifying  any  significant  changes  in  subscriber </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 16px;">numbers;</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(b)  the number of complaints it has handled and the outcomes reached, both in </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">aggregate for the all subscribers and individually in relation to each subscriber;</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(c)  a summary of any investigations carried out an the result of them;</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(d)  a  report  on  the  adequacy  and  effectiveness  of  compliance  processes  and </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">procedures adopted by subscribers; and</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(e)  information about the extent to which the arbitration service had been used.</span>

<h3>Arbitration service</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-43"><a href="#para4-43" name="para4-43">4.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The high cost and real complexity of civil law and procedure, as it relates to media issues,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been a theme running through this Inquiry. Both complainants and publishers have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complained of how slow and expensive it is to take an issue to court. However, there are a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantial number of disputes every year between individuals and publishers that are about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the civil rights of the complainants. Under the current system some of these the subject</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of legal action, though very few see their way through to a judgment of the court. Some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">manifest as complaints to the PCC but the complainants are often too unsure of their rights</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or do not commence proceedings because they are unable to afford (or are too concerned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the potential consequences of) litigation.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-44"><a href="#para4-44" name="para4-44">4.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The balance of power between the publishers and complainants in these cases has shifted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">over time. At one time publishers could rest secure in the knowledge that only the very rich</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and very determined would be able to make a challenge in relation to defamation or privacy.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Then the introduction of Conditional Fee Agreements (CFAs) and after the event insurance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">changed the balance and ordinary people were able to make claims. Some high profile claims</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were made, not least with regard to phone hacking, and many complainants were successful</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in their actions. But the balance is now moving back, with the new changes to the CFA regime,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meaning that individuals will no longer be able to take action without fear of potentially</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impossibly damaging costs: this problem has been examined in detail and is an area that is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very likely to come under further scrutiny.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref49" href="#footnote49">49</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-45"><a href="#para4-45" name="para4-45">4.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is self evident that this situation is far from ideal. What is needed is a quick, fair and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inexpensive system for resolving these disputes. Of course, no one can be forced to give up</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their right to go to court in pursuit, or for the protection, of their rights. However, that does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not argue against the need for some arbitral system to be available.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-46"><a href="#para4-46" name="para4-46">4.46</a></p>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that the Board should provide an arbitral process in relation to civil legal </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">claims against subscribers, drawing on independent legal experts of high reputation </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">and ability on a cost-only basis to the subscribing member: it should not be difficult to </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">provide such expertise, not only from those who have retired from the Bench but also </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">from the most senior ranks of the legal profession. The process should be fair, quick </span>

<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">and inexpensive, inquisitorial and free for complainants to use (save for a power to </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">make an adverse order for the costs of the arbitrator if proceedings are frivolous or</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref49" name="footnote49" title="Go back to footnote reference 49 in the text">49</a>.  Part J Chapter 3</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1768"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">vexatious). The arbitrator must have the power to hold hearings where necessary </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">but, equally, to dispense with them where it is not necessary. The process must have </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">a system to allow frivolous or vexatious claims to be struck out at an early stage. </span>

<p id="para-id-4-47"><a href="#para4-47" name="para4-47">4.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As acknowledged above, neither publishers nor complainants can be forced to use such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a system. However, the regulator should offer publishers the right to use the system and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">equally, all complainants should be encouraged to use it as well. I consider below how use of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the provision of an arbitration service could be incentivised by way of costs advantages both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for potential claimants and for publishers along with the wider benefits that it could bring.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mechanisms for appeal to the courts (by way of review rather than rehearing) would have to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be acknowledged.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-48"><a href="#para4-48" name="para4-48">4.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is worth repeating that the ideal outcome is a satisfactory independent regulatory body,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">established by the industry, that is able to secure the voluntary support and membership</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the entire industry and thus able to command the support of the public. I have set out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">here the minimum requirements for a &#8216;satisfactory independent regulatory body&#8217;. I recognise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, whilst this has much in common with the model proposed by the industry, there are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantive differences between what I am recommending and the model put forward by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black. The main differences are in the extent of the independence of the body from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry, first in the appointments process, second in the role of serving editors and third in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the allocation of funding. In terms of organisational structure and the contractual framework,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there is no reason why Lord Black&#8217;s model should not be capable of adaptation to meet the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requirements set down here if the industry were able to support such a move, and if the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other, more substantive, changes around independence and effectiveness were made.</span>

<h2>5. Encouraging membership</h2>

<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If parts of the industry were to come together to set up a body meeting the requirements set</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out above, the question must remain as to whether a sufficient proportion of the industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would join the body to make it an effective industry regulator. A great number of possible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">incentives for membership of an industry regulatory body have been put forward to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry. They have been looked at earlier.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup> Naturally I hope that the desire to be able to use</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a kitemark signifying compliance with high standards would be an important incentive to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">membership, but realistically I recognise that those most eager to use a standards kitemark</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are likely to be those already meeting high standards. The power of a kitemark to draw in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those less concerned by standards is unclear. I have already made clear my view of some of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the other potential incentives to membership.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">51</a></sup> In practice, it seems to me that there are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">three areas where it might be possible to craft a relatively significant benefit for publishers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who choose to sign up to a satisfactory independent regulatory body.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first relates to data protection. I have already set out a number of recommendations for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">changes that I think should be made to the data protection regime to enhance the ability</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO) to perform its functions in relation to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref52" href="#footnote52">52</a></sup> These include making it simpler for the ICO to use its existing powers to investigate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cases of possible breaches of the legal requirements of the data protection regime, as well as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taking a more focused approach to the promotion of standards of good practice in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">handling of personal data within press organisations.</span>

<a name="page1769"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I  recommend  that  in  any  reconsideration  of  the  powers  of  the  Information </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">Commissioner  (or  replacement  body),  power  is  given  to  that  body  to  determine </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">that  membership  of  a  satisfactory  regulatory  body,  which  required  appropriate </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">governance and transparency standards from its members in relation to compliance </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">with data protection legislation and good practice, should be taken into account when </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">considering whether it is necessary or proportionate to take any steps in relation to a </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">subscriber to that body.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-3"><a href="#para5-3" name="para5-3">5.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is not to suggest that a different level of data protection regulation would apply to a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publisher who was a member of a regulatory body as opposed to one who was not. On the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contrary, the law would, naturally, apply in exactly the same way to both. The difference would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be in the approach that it would be appropriate for the Information Commissioner to take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to audit when, on the one hand, he sees an operation that has signed up to high standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of privacy and data protection and which operates effective and transparent governance,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whereas on the other hand he has no information about that company&#8217;s approach to data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protection other than what he can find out by asking.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-4"><a href="#para5-4" name="para5-4">5.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, the area where a substantive benefit might be derived from membership of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory body is costs in relation to the resolution of disputes. I have said already that I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consider that it is essential that a regulatory body should offer and fair, quick and inexpensive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arbitral system to deal with media disputes. Such a system should be of benefit to all who use</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it, cutting out a large amount of time, effort and expenditure currently engaged in litigation.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not, of course, possible to deprive anyone, claimant or defendant, of their right to have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their case heard by a court. But it is possible for the court to take account of whether either</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">party has taken all possible steps to resolve the issue in a less expensive way.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-5"><a href="#para5-5" name="para5-5">5.5</a></p>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that it should be open to any subscriber to a recognised regulatory body </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">to rely on the fact of their membership and on the opportunity it provides for the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">claimant to use a fair, fast and inexpensive arbitration service. It could request the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">court to encourage the use of that system of arbitration and, equally, to have regard </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">to the availability of the arbitration system when considering claims for costs incurred </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">by a claimant who could have used the arbitration service. On the issue of costs, it </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">should equally be open to a claimant to rely on failure by a newspaper to subscribe </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">to the regulator thereby depriving him or her of access to a fair, fast and inexpensive </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">arbitration service. Where that is the case, in the exercise of its discretion, the court </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">could take the view that, even where the defendant is successful, absent unreasonable </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">or vexatious conduct on the part of the claimant, it would be inappropriate for the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">claimant to be expected to pay the costs incurred in defending the action. </span>

<p id="para-id-5-6"><a href="#para5-6" name="para5-6">5.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At one extreme, when the court concluded that it was entirely reasonable for a claimant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(although unsuccessful) to bring the claim, it might be possible for the court to go further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and order that the claimant&#8217;s costs should be met by the defendant: the justification would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be that although the claimant has not been successful, by not being a member of an industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator, the defendant had forced the claimant to use the expensive court system whereas</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an effective arbitral mechanism could have resolved the issue without the expenditure on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">costs at all.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-7"><a href="#para5-7" name="para5-7">5.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This does not need to work only one way and should not. Where a publisher is a member</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of an industry body, and therefore does offer access to an arbitration system, the claimant</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">can obviously nonetheless choose to take the publisher to court instead: Article 6 demands</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref53" name="footnote53" title="Go back to footnote reference 53 in the text">53</a>.  This approach to costs is discussed further in connection with the civil law: see Part J Chapter 3</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1770"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">nothing less. In this case, however, it would be open to the court to take the view that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">claimant had deliberately chosen to take the high cost route of litigation and could refuse to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">award costs if the claimant were successful. Whether it could go further and permit the judge</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to exercise a discretion to require a claimant to meet the costs of the defendant is, perhaps,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">another matter: I do not express a view about it.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-8"><a href="#para5-8" name="para5-8">5.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This approach could have the effect of providing a strong incentive to publishers to join an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent regulatory body. I acknowledge that this may be largely an economic calculation,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that that calculation will be different for each title, depending on the extent to which it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expects to face litigation and the costs it might incur in the course of that litigation. There are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no publicly available s that would enable me to say with confidence what the potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">benefit to the industry is here, not least because that benefit would also depend on the cost</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the regulator, the cost of the arbitral regime and any impact the existence of that regime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might have on the number of cases being brought. I do, however, expect this to provide a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">genuine economic benefit to membership of a body.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-9"><a href="#para5-9" name="para5-9">5.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, I believe that it would be appropriate for it to be open to a court to award aggravated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or exemplary damages against an unsuccessful defendant who has not only failed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">demonstrate a proactive commitment to high journalistic standards but also deprived a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complainant of access to fast, fair and inexpensive arbitral mechanism by refusing to join an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent regulatory body: this would require a change to the law which I have addressed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">earlier.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref54" href="#footnote54">54</a></sup></span>

<a name="section6"></a>
<h2>6. Giving effect to the incentives </h2>

<p id="para-id-6-1"><a href="#para6-1" name="para6-1">6.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Iwillsayagain,becauseitcannotbesaidtoooften,thattheidealoutcomefrommyperspective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is a satisfactory self organised but independent regulatory body, established by the industry,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that is able to secure the voluntary support and membership of the entire industry and thus</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">able to command the support of the public. In order to achieve that, it is necessary both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to have a satisfactory independent regulatory body established by the industry, and that it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should secure support from the entire industry. The incentives described in Section 4 above</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aim to build that support. However, as described above they suffer from a significant flaw.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That flaw is the word &#8216;satisfactory&#8217; which I have used so far to describe an independent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory system that meets the requirements set out above.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-2"><a href="#para6-2" name="para6-2">6.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The incentives described above rely on action being taken by the courts, and by the ICO, on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the basis of a company&#8217;s membership of a body. This can only be possible if the courts and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO have a way of determining whether they should consider that a body that the company is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a member of is &#8216;satisfactory&#8217; &#8211; in other words, how can the courts tell the difference between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a properly constituted independent regulatory body meeting all the requirements set down</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in Section 4 and a body that fails to meet some or all of those requirements but nonetheless</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">holds itself out as doing so?</span>

<p id="para-id-6-3"><a href="#para6-3" name="para6-3">6.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The only solution to this is a recognition process of some kind for the independent regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body. This brings me to &#8216;statutory underpinning&#8217;. There has been a lot of discussion, both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within and outside the Inquiry, of statutory underpinning, its merits and its dangers. Close to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">home, there is an example of statutory underpinning in the Irish Press Council, which has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accepted without demur by several UK newspaper publishers, notably including Northern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Shell. In that case, there is a statute which sets out the requirements that must be met</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for a Press Council to be recognised by the Parliament, with members of the recognised Press</span>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref54" name="footnote54" title="Go back to footnote reference 54 in the text">54</a>.  Part I Chapter 3</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1771"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">Council then being able to use that membership as a demonstration that they achieve certain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards when defending themselves in defamation litigation. Something similar (although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not at all identical) is required in this country.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-4"><a href="#para6-4" name="para6-4">6.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Suffice to say, in order to meet the public concern that the organisation by the press of its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation is by a body which is independent of the press, independent of Parliament and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent of the Government, that fulfils the legitimate requirements of such a body</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and can provide, by way of benefit to its subscribers, recognition of involvement in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">maintenance of high standards of journalism:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that the law must identify those legitimate requirements and provide a </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">mechanism to recognise and certify that a new body meets them. </span>

<p id="para-id-6-5"><a href="#para6-5" name="para6-5">6.5</a></p>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that the responsibility for recognition and certification of a regulator </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">shall rest with a recognition body. In its capacity as the recognition body, it will not </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">be involved in regulation of any subscriber.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Oncerecognised, theregulatory body would have no further interaction with the state,orwith</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the body that recognised it, other than to ensure that it continues to meet the requirements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for recognition.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">In practice, I recommend that the requirements for recognition should be those set </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">out in Section 4 above.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If that were the case then bodies (like the ICO) would be able to be sure that any member of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a recognised regulatory body would be required to meet basic governance requirements and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be following a Code that covered respect for privacy. The courts would be able to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sure that any member of a recognised regulatory body had ascribed to standards that met</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specified and acceptable criteria and was a member of a quick, fair and inexpensive arbitral</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scheme that anyone could use when seeking redress from them.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-6"><a href="#para6-6" name="para6-6">6.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The majority, though not all, of the national press has made it very clear that they regard</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statutory underpinning as unnecessary and dangerous. Some have gone further and indicated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that they would find it unacceptable. In some cases, these same companies are quite happy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to participate in a statutorily recognised system in Ireland. The Inquiry has heard evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from all three major political parties that statutory underpinning is an option.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-7"><a href="#para6-7" name="para6-7">6.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The main argument that has been made against statutory underpinning or recognition is that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any legislation touching on press standards provides the thin end of the wedge for political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interference in the press. There is a countervailing argument that any such legislation could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also be used to provide, for the first time, statutory protection for the freedom of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from Government interference. I explore this idea further below.</span>
<h3>Recognition process</h3>

<p id="para-id-6-8"><a href="#para6-8" name="para6-8">6.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Recognition requires a recognition process, and body to carry out that process. The legislation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">setting out the requirements for recognition would also have to set out both the process and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who would be responsible for carrying it out. I will start with the recognition body.</span>

<a name="page1772"></a><!--new page--><h4>The recognition body</h4>

<p id="para-id-6-9"><a href="#para6-9" name="para6-9">6.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The role of the recognition body is essentially an objective one. Its task would be simply to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">check that the statutory requirements have been met by the body applying for recognition.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having said that, it is also one that requires a degree of expertise in order to assess that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criteria have been met. The role would consist of:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) approving the independence of appointment processes (if the approach above is</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">adopted);</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) checking whether bodies applying for recognition meet the statutory criteria on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">application;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) periodically reviewing that recognised bodies continue to meet the statutory criteria;</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) in specifically defined circumstances, carrying out any ad hoc reviews that a recognised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body continues to meet the statutory criteria should the need arise.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-10"><a href="#para6-10" name="para6-10">6.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As regards (c) and (d) above:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that the operation of any certified body should be reviewed by the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">recognition body after two years and thereafter at three yearly intervals.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The purpose of review is solely to ensure that the requirements for recognition continue to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be satisfied. The circumstances in which an ad hoc review might be necessary could perfectly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">properly be defined restrictively.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-11"><a href="#para6-11" name="para6-11">6.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As for who should fulfil this function, two fundamental options exist for the role of recognition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body. One is to create a new body to undertake the role, and the second is to give the role to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an existing body.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-12"><a href="#para6-12" name="para6-12">6.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A new body would have this one role and this one role only. This gives rise to an immediate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">difficulty. The recognition body has a significant on going role and it is not one that could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be done easily by an ad hoc body. Equally it is an intermittent role, at best, and a standing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body would have little or nothing to do most of the time. Its decisions will be potentially</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">controversial and open to challenge by judicial review. If, for example, PressBoF was to come</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">forward with its current proposal and seek recognition, the recognition body would have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to refuse, because the current proposal as drafted does not meet the requirements set out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">above, and the implications of refusing an application by a body with the support of the vast</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">majority of the publishing industry are significant. The recognition body would need to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">able to demonstrate that its processes were sound, that its approach was objective and that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its decision was grounded in evidence and was taken correctly. All this means that in order to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">do the job properly the body must be capable of running a demonstrably competent, expert</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and objective process.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-13"><a href="#para6-13" name="para6-13">6.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A new body with a single role would by definition be inexperienced, and might be in a weak</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">position, vulnerable to press influence. The intermittent but ongoing nature of the role make</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it poorly suited to a standalone, specially appointed individual or body. The body carrying out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this work must have the power to reach the correct decisions without being overly pressured</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the press. This also argues against a sole purpose individual or body which would be very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">vulnerable to the sorts of antagonistic campaigns that the press are capable of mounting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when they perceive themselves to be under threat. One way of dealing with that would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to support an independent individual, or panel, appointed to carry out the recognition task</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">within an established body.</span>
<a name="page1773"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-6-14"><a href="#para6-14" name="para6-14">6.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This leaves the option of giving the role to an existing body or using an existing body to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">support a new, independent, post. Options that I considered are: Parliament, the courts and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom. Parliament is, in many ways, an obvious option. The Irish Defamation Act adopts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this model, with Parliament approving an order for recognition that is made by the Minister.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, one of the fundamental requirements for the regulatory body is independence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the Government. Any Parliamentary process would be likely to be perceived by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry, and possibly by the public, as Government interference in the independence of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press. Certainly it is not obvious to me that the Government, or Parliament, have any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular qualification for this role that would outweigh the negative connotations of an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent regulatory body having to seek the approval of the Government. Indeed, it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">worse than that because there may need to be some measure of negotiation as the industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seeks to resolve the challenges that are involved in creating a body that satisfies the criteria</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that I have described. The idea of the industry negotiating either with Parliament or the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government does raise what I readily perceive to be significant issues of independence.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-15"><a href="#para6-15" name="para6-15">6.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The courts have the requisite strength to undertake the role. However, I repeat the point that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have just made: the nature of the recognition process, which has nothing to do with issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relating to editorial content, is such that what is required is an inquisitorial consideration</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of whether the criteria have been met, possibly involving discussion with the body about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any changes which might be required in order to meet the criteria: there is no satisfactory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mechanism by which the courts could fulfil that role.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-16"><a href="#para6-16" name="para6-16">6.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom has the requisite standing and expertise. However, Ofcom&#8217;s role in content regulation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to broadcasting is likely to be seen by some as a very significant objection to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them carrying out this recognition role. This is primarily a presentational issue rather than a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantive one. The recognition role requires a judgment to be made only that the proposal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">satisfies the statutory requirements. For the most part, these will only touch on governance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues. The only exception is that the recognition body would be required to determine</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether the standards code met the statutory requirements, but as set out in Section 4</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">above, these requirements specify only that particular subjects should be covered but do not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lay down any particular requirements on how they should be covered.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-17"><a href="#para6-17" name="para6-17">6.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I recognise that there is a risk that this process could involve a degree of subjective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interpretation of concepts such as taking account of the rights of individuals. However, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reality, I have no doubt that Ofcom would consult and issue guidance on how such concepts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be interpreted. The decision making process would have to be transparent and, as I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have indicated, it would be subject to judicial oversight by way of appeal or review.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-18"><a href="#para6-18" name="para6-18">6.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom is a statutory regulator and its Chair is appointed by the Government. However, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is also an independent regulator and its independence is accepted by the broadcasting,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">telecommunicationsandpostalservicesindustriesthatitregulates.Inbothtelecommunications</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and postal services, there is a European requirement for independent regulation, which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom meets. It is worth noting that, although its role in broadcasting content regulation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been much talked of, Ofcom carries out a wide range of regulatory functions, including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">competition regulation in communications markets. It has experience of the sort of role</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposed here in the many co-regulatory systems where Ofcom must approve or recognise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the industry established regulator. It is also worth noting that Ofcom has two general duties:</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 15px;"> to</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> further</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> the</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> interests</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> of</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> citizens</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> in</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> communications</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> matters;</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> and</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 15px;"> to</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> further</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> the</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> interests</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> of</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> consumers</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> in</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> communications</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> markets.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref55" href="#footnote55">55</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref55" name="footnote55" title="Go back to footnote reference 55 in the text">55</a>.  s3 Communications Act 2003 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/section/3</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1774"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-6-19"><a href="#para6-19" name="para6-19">6.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, in carrying out those general duties Ofcom must seek to reduce regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">burdens, including having regard to whether the objectives of regulation are being met by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effective self-regulation. In other words, although Ofcom is a statutory regulator, it has a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statutory bias in favour of self-regulation and a statutory focus on the interests of citizens and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consumers. A more specific duty to secure and promote freedom of speech and the freedom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press in relation to the role of recognising an independent press regulatory body could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be added should that be considered desirable.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-20"><a href="#para6-20" name="para6-20">6.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The final option is that of some independent person or panel, a Recognition Commissioner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or Commission, sitting within an existing body with the expertise and size to provide both the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">technical and legal support that would be needed. Obviously such a person or panel would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">need to be appointed in a way sufficiently independent from the industry and from political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">influence. Three questions arise: what are the necessary characteristics for a Recognition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner; who should appoint them; and what body would provide the administration</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and expertise to support them.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-21"><a href="#para6-21" name="para6-21">6.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am going to approach the last of these questions first, because the answer has significant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">implications for the first. In the light of the assessment above, I am inclined to the view</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the only body capable of providing an independent Recognition Commissioner with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary expertise in this matter is Ofcom. This would mean that Ofcom would provide the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner with the necessary technical, legal and administrative expertise to undertake</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the necessary process of recognition, but that the decision taken would be that of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner himself (or the Commission), without any influence or input from the Ofcom</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Board.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-22"><a href="#para6-22" name="para6-22">6.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thus the Commissioner would need to be an independent person, with experience of being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsible for weighing evidence and taking significant decisions, but need not have specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">experience of the press or of regulation. He or she would have to be appointed by another</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">process independent of the press, independent of the Government and independent of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the legislature. Again, it could involve those who hold equivalent responsibilities in other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">areas such as the Commissioner for Public Appointments and the Chairman of the Judicial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Appointments Commission.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-23"><a href="#para6-23" name="para6-23">6.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is no single obvious best option for a recognition body. Ofcom is by far the best qualified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body for the role, and I do think it is important that the expertise that Ofcom holds is brought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to bear on the recognition process. In all the circumstances:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I  recommend  that  the  role  of  recognition  body,  that  is  to  say,  to  recognise  and </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">certify that any particular body satisfies (and, on review, continues to satisfy) the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">requirements set out in law should fall on Ofcom. A less attractive alternative (on the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">basis that any individual will not have the requisite authority or experience and will </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">only be occasionally be required to fulfil these functions) is for the appointment of an </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">independent Recognition Commissioner supported by officials at Ofcom.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref56" href="#footnote56">56</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In either case, the decisions could be subject to appeal and would undeniably be liable to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">judicial review, so that ultimately responsibility would sit with the courts.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref56" name="footnote56" title="Go back to footnote reference 56 in the text">56</a>.  Shami Chakrabarti has advised that she prefers this role to be fulfilled by the court but I do not see how the<span style="font-size: 12px;"> court,of its own motion, could adopt an adjudicative role in relation to certification or subsequent review. Somebody wouldhave to be prepared to challenge either the extent to which the new body fulfilled the requirements of the legislationor the proposition that it should continue to do so. If that was Ofcom, and Ofcom raised no objection, there would benothing upon which the court could adjudicate. Thus, the decision would become whether Ofcom was satisfied. A verysimilar role would be available to the court if there was an appeal from an adverse decision of Ofcom (which couldallow a merits challenge rather than be limited to the more restrictive justification for intervention that is provided by judicial review.</span></p><!--footnote-->

<a name="page1775"></a><!--new page--><h4>The recognition process</h4>

<p id="para-id-6-24"><a href="#para6-24" name="para6-24">6.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The intention is that the press and periodical industry should come together, as they have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">done under Lord Black, and bring forward a proposed body that would meet the requirements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for recognition. There are, no doubt, details about the process that would need to be worked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out. What I envisage is that the various industry representatives would decide to set up a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body capable of recognition. They might want to discuss how they are approaching the task</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Ofcom and thus ensure that there is a mutual understanding about an acceptable way</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">forward. Such a discussion could include the proposed appointments process before the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">key appointments are made, in order to ensure that the requirements are met at the right</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">time. Indeed, I would encourage a continuing dialogue between those establishing a body</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Ofcom throughout the process, to ensure that the statutory requirements were fully</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understood, all the while recognising the very limited role that Ofcom would have.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-25"><a href="#para6-25" name="para6-25">6.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Once a body was fully established it would seek recognition from Ofcom, providing evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of its funding agreement, governance structures and code. Ofcom would test each against</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the statutory requirements and either approve the body or raise any reasons as to why the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requirements are not met. The body would then have the option of amending the proposal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in a way which would satisfy the statutory requirements, withdrawing its application, or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">challenging the decision of Ofcom decision not to recognise it.  K7.2 shows how the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognition process applies to the illustrative functions of the independent body shown in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">figure K7.1. Speaking for myself, assuming that the exercise is undertaken in a way that seeks</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to fulfil that which I have described, I see no difficulty in recognition being comparatively</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">straightforward.</span>

<a name="page1776"></a>
</span>
<span class="newpage">

<h4><a name="figureK7-2" href="#figureK7-2" title="Link to figure K7.2">Figure K7.2</a></h4>

<p id="para-id-6-26"><a href="#para6-26" name="para6-26">6.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is necessary to address the question of how many bodies Ofcom could recognise. My</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">starting point is that only one regulatory body should be recognised at any one time. There</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are good reasons for this. A single regulatory body would mean a common set of standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">49</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">across the industry, ensuring that individuals knew what was expected of the press, where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to go to if they had a problem and would not need to deal with multiple regulatory bodies if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they had a problem that crossed many titles. A single regulatory body would have oversight</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the whole industry (or at least as much of it as had joined the body) and would be able to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">take a view on standards across the industry, including pan title investigations into systemic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues. There is no risk of inconsistent decisions by different regulators effectively considering</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the same material. In Ireland, the Minister is only permitted to recognise one Press Council</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the Inquiry has not been made aware of that causing any problems, either at the point at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which the Press Council was recognised or subsequently.</span>

<a name="page1777"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-6-27"><a href="#para6-27" name="para6-27">6.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, there are potential difficulties with this approach. The UK press is not particularly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">homogenous: the evidence given to the Inquiry as to why some publishers currently sit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">outside the PCC suggests that the whole industry may find it difficult to work together.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence provided by editors in relation to the proposals from Lord Black show some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">differences in approach to regulation: the Guardian, The Independent and the Financial Times</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have reservations about the approach to regulation taken by PressBoF, the regional press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are anxious not to find themselves paying for the sins of the nationals and online providers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">see themselves having little or nothing in common with the majority of the printed press.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In Ireland, the single industry body had been formed before the Government shaped the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legislation, and the legislation was shaped to fit the body. There is no equivalent industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body in existence in the UK now, and, assuming that this solution found favour with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government, there is no guarantee that one would emerge in the few months between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication of the Report and the introduction of legislation.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-28"><a href="#para6-28" name="para6-28">6.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is, therefore, conceivable that Ofcom might face multiple bids for the role of regulator.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The legislation would have to have some way of dealing with that eventuality, even if it were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered to be relatively remote. The alternatives are to provide Ofcom with some means</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of selecting a single regulatory body to recognise, or giving it the power to recognise more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than one regulatory body. The obvious, and fair, approach to choosing between competing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bids would be for the recognition body to set a date by which bids should be received and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hold some form of &#8216;beauty contest&#8217; to see which of the bids was preferable. An alternative</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">solutionwouldbetoaddanewrequirementthattheregulatorybodyhadtohavemembership</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of over 50% of the relevant industry. Another approach would simply be for the recognition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body to recognise the first compliant body put before it.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-29"><a href="#para6-29" name="para6-29">6.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">All of these options have significant disadvantages. A &#8216;beauty parade&#8217; would lead to Ofcom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">having to identify criteria on which it would select and apply subjective judgments over and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">abovetheapplicationofthestatutoryrequirementsapprovedbyParliament.Thiswouldmove</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the role of recognition along the line from a mostly technical one to a wholly subjective one.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This would be likely to give rise to significant concerns about the nature of the recognition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">process and the degree of interference from Ofcom as it made its choice between potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory bodies.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-30"><a href="#para6-30" name="para6-30">6.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An approach which required a minimum level of industry membership would be objective.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, too high a level might be too difficult for any industry grouping to achieve. Any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proportion over 50% would make it possible for a few of the major publishers between them</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to ensure that the only proposal going forward was one led by them, irrespective of whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they actually had the support of the majority of the rest of the industry. It is questionable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as to whether it would be helpful to put this much power in the hands of any of the large</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">players.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-31"><a href="#para6-31" name="para6-31">6.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Requiring the recognition body to recognise the first compliant bid would be an objective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">test. However, it is undoubtedly true that an individual organisation could run a spoiler bid,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">designed solely according to their own lights, more quickly than the majority of the industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be able to reach agreement on a genuine agreed independent regulatory body. Such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an event may be unlikely, but it is a contingency that must be guarded against.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-32"><a href="#para6-32" name="para6-32">6.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are also advantages to allowing more than one regulatory body. Different parts of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry might want to apply different standards. As long as the standards offered meet the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requirements set out above, there is no obvious reason to require the whole of the industry</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to coalesce around the standards acceptable to those who wish to do the least. If parts of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the industry wanted to aspire to higher standards it is difficult to see why they should not be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">encouraged to do that.</span>
<a name="page1778"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-6-33"><a href="#para6-33" name="para6-33">6.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The problems associated with multiple bodies are fragmentation of standards and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">response. This is not necessarily a substantive concern. Anyone complaining to multiple titles</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will be complaining about different articles, and consequently the complaints will themselves</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be different and even a single regulatory body would have to deal with them differently. If</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the standards are voluntary it is difficult to see any principled reason why, as long as they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meet the statutory criteria, it should be a matter of concern if they are different. There is no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obvious reason why someone should not be entitled, for example, to pursue an apology from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Guardian when it purports to meet higher standards, which it would not expect to receive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from a local newspaper or blog in relation to the same story.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-34"><a href="#para6-34" name="para6-34">6.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The other concern identified is about the difficulty of conducting systemic investigations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">across the industry if there is more than one regulator. This undoubtedly could be an issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and it is possible to imagine issues that would warrant a pan industry investigation. One</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">possible solution to this problem would be to make it a criterion for recognition that the body</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would agree procedures and cooperate with any other recognised regulatory body in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to complaints or systemic investigations that cover titles across regulator boundaries: they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might even agree a common appeals mechanism to ensure consistency of approach.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-35"><a href="#para6-35" name="para6-35">6.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A concern raised about having a single regulator is that some organisations might find that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that single recognised regulator simply was not set up to accommodate their particular</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">business: the standards might be onerous but irrelevant, the fees might be too high, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">governance requirements might be too burdensome and bureaucratic for a small publisher.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This would be important if meaningful incentives were in place to encourage membership,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as the organisations for which the single regulatory body was not appropriate would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">forced to choose between forgoing the benefits of membership or submitting themselves</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to inappropriate regulation. Neither can be desirable. If multiple bodies were permitted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there would be at least the theoretical possibility that they could collectively set up their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">own compliant body more geared towards their business model. Alternatively, or as well, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criteria for recognition could be strengthened to explicitly require the body to offer variable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">membership categories, with appropriate governance requirements and fee structures.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-36"><a href="#para6-36" name="para6-36">6.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the other side of the coin is the cost: I am not in a position to challenge Lord Black&#8217;s view</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as to the cost of the proposals by PressBoF but I am sure that multiple regulators would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">duplicate cost and thus increase it for an industry that, at least in some of its manifestations,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is suffering financial hardship. In the circumstances, I have no doubt that it would be ideal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if the press came together to form an independent regulatory body, that would meet all of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the requirements that I have set down here, and that would garner the support of all key</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publishers.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-37"><a href="#para6-37" name="para6-37">6.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the circumstances, I would strongly urge that it is in the best interests of the industry and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public that a single regulatory body should establish a single set of standards on which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public can rely. Failure to do so would be a sad indictment of the inability of the press to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">put commercial interest to one side, in order to come together in the public interest to create</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a system of independent regulation that would protect both freedom of expression and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rights of individuals. However, I do recognise that, should that ideal scenario not arise, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be difficult to find an appropriate basis on which Ofcom could decide which of any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">competing proposals should be recognised. For this reason:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that it should be possible for the recognition body to recognise more </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">than  one  regulatory  body,  should  more  than  one  seek  recognition  and  meet  the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">criteria, but I must emphasise that this is not an outcome I would advocate, and I </span>

<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 13px;">would regard it as a failure on the part of the industry should it be necessary for that </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 13px;">step to be taken.</span>
<a name="page1779"></a><!--new page--><h3>Protection of freedom of the press</h3>

<p id="para-id-6-38"><a href="#para6-38" name="para6-38">6.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It has been argued that any legislation touching on press regulation would be the beginning</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the slippery slope; that any Government would find it easier to amend an existing Act than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to bring forward new legislation to shackle the press; that Parliament is itching to control the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press and that this would be an opportunity to do so. I do not accept any of these arguments.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If the history of the last 50 years on press regulation tells us anything, it tells us that Parliament</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wants nothing less than to pass legislation to regulate the press. There may have been the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occasional siren voice expressing a contrary view but, in truth, Parliament has managed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">avoid many opportunities to do so, despite real (and repeated) public concern about press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behaviour and the consequences of failing to deal with it.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-39"><a href="#para6-39" name="para6-39">6.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is no foundation in the suggestion that it is easier to amend an existing Act than to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bring in a new one. Any statute only gives Government, or anyone else, the powers that are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stated on the face of the legislation. If a statute simply provides for a recognition process for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a press regulatory body then it can only be used for that purpose. Any attempt to introduce</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further legislation of the press would require a new Act of Parliament which could make</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">new provisions or amend an existing Act, but it would need to be a new Act, and go through</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exactly the same processes that an Act establishing a recognition process would need to do</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">today.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-40"><a href="#para6-40" name="para6-40">6.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having said that, I recognise the concern expressed by many and, in order to address the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">slippery slope argument, it would be possible to use a statute setting up a recognition process</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for a regulatory body to also place an explicit duty on the Government to protect the freedom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press. I have already referred earlier to an example of just this, drawing heavily from s3</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, which would look like this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref57" href="#footnote57">57</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(3) Interference with the activities of the media shall be lawful only insofar as it is for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a legitimate purpose and is necessary in a democratic society, having full regard to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Without necessarily suggesting that the clause should be worded in exactly this way, as I am</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sure there would be benefit from further consideration around the precision with which the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intention is expressed, this seems to me to be an admirable proposal, which should provide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some comfort to those who have any concerns about the risk of Government decisions</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">of recognition and review of whether those requirements are and continue to be </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">met, the law should also place an explicit duty on the Government to uphold and </span>

<h2>7. Summary of recommendations</h2>

<p id="para-id-7-1"><a href="#para7-1" name="para7-1">7.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">From the outset, I have encouraged the industry to come together to create an independent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory regime that satisfies the need to provide public confidence. In my judgment,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the proposals so far put forward by the industry do not do that. I have been very specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about where I consider those proposals would need revision in order meet expectations,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but essentially they fail in respect of independence and inclusiveness. I regard both of these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">points as absolutely essential in any new effective regulatory regime.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-2"><a href="#para7-2" name="para7-2">7.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have therefore set out a vision of a voluntary independent self-organised regulatory system</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that would provide an appropriate degree of independence from the industry, coupled with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">satisfactory powers to handle complaints, promote and enforce standards, and deal with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dispute resolution.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref58" href="#footnote58">58</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-3"><a href="#para7-3" name="para7-3">7.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In order to provide incentives to publishers to join such a voluntary independent regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system, I have recommended a series of incentives that will provide benefits to those who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sign up to the system.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup> Significantly, these include consequences in relation to the costs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of litigation in privacy, defamation and other media cases (even if successful), if, by non-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">membership of the regulatory system, it has deprived a claimant of a quick, fair, low cost</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arbitral route. On the basis that the court could also conclude that a publisher that did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subscribe and was found to have infringed the civil law rights of a claimant, it might also be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">possible to conclude that the breach is evidence of wilful disregard of standards and thereby</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potentially lead to a claim for exemplary damages. I believe that these proposals should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provide a powerful incentive for all publishers to want to be a part of such a self-regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">system.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-4"><a href="#para7-4" name="para7-4">7.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In order to give effect to those incentives I have recommended legislation that underpins the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent self-organised regulatory system and facilitates its recognition in legal processes.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This legislative proposal does no more than ensure an appropriate degree of independence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and effectiveness on the part of the self-regulatory body if the incentives described are to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made use of. This is not, and cannot be characterised as, regulation of the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-5"><a href="#para7-5" name="para7-5">7.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of newspaper groups are fiercely supportive of the proposal put forward by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black. But others have indicated that they still have problems of principle with what is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposed by Lord Black, as do I. Let me be clear: even if all the national newspaper publishers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were to sign up to the contracts proposed by Lord Black, I would still recommend that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significant changes would need to be made to that system in order to meet the requirements,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particularly in relation to independence, that I set out above.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-6"><a href="#para7-6" name="para7-6">7.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Let me further be clear that if an adequately independent regulatory body were to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">established by industry and signed up to by all major news publishers, I still recommend</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the underpinning statute to provide for recognition of that body, a mechanism to ensure</span>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref58" name="footnote58" title="Go back to footnote reference 58 in the text">58</a>.  See Part K, Chapter 7</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref59" name="footnote59" title="Go back to footnote reference 59 in the text">59</a>.  See Part K, Chapter 7</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1781"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">that it maintained the standards expected of it and support for an arbitration system. Such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognition would be important evidence that the system met legitimate public demands</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for independence, it could provide relevant evidence of systems and standards that would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">doubtless assist the courts and could also impact both on damages and in relation to costs. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would also be the only way to ensure that participants in the system could access the benefits</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that I have set out in relation to costs.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-7"><a href="#para7-7" name="para7-7">7.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I repeat the refrain that what I want is for the industry to come together to organise their own</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent regulatory system. If they cannot agree on a single regulatory system, I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">left the door open, however undesirable it might be, to there being more than one such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent regulatory system. I cannot see any legitimate reason why the press should not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accept this approach and provide the public with the independent regulation that it deserves.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-8"><a href="#para7-8" name="para7-8">7.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As for the challenge that this goes too far, I simply do not accept that these provisions will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have a chilling effect on free speech or press freedom. Neither do I accept that politicians</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will be more willing and able to amend the provisions which I have suggested (as opposed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to legislating afresh which is always open to them). I reject the suggestion that it will cause a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">degeneration of the rights of the press or a descent into state control.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-9"><a href="#para7-9" name="para7-9">7.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have made it clear that I firmly believe it is in the best interest of the public and the industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that an independent self organised regulatory body is set up, and recognised in statute so</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that its members can benefit from the legal privileges that would go with membership. Given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public appetite for some accountability of the press, I do not think that either the victims</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or the public would understand if the industry did not grasp this opportunity. Neither would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they understand if I were not to consider the consequences of the industry failing to deliver</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the independent regulation that is required.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-10"><a href="#para7-10" name="para7-10">7.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Unfortunately there may be some in the industry who it presently appears would not consider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">going beyond the present PCC proposals. If that is the case, I have set out in the next Chapter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the options that I believe would be open to (and necessary for) the Government to pursue.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Suffice to say, bearing in mind my duty to consider the interests of the public, my view is that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there would then be no alternative but to provide in legislation for a backstop regulator to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apply and enforce a Code.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-11"><a href="#para7-11" name="para7-11">7.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It would be a great pity, however, if the intransigence of a few resulted in the imposition of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system which everyone in the industry has said they do not want and which, in all probability,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very few others would actually want to see in place. This is not an explicit recommendation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that I am making: whether it becomes necessary to take the proposition further, in the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest, depends on the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-12"><a href="#para7-12" name="para7-12">7.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rather, I would much prefer that the focus of all concerned should be on attempting to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deliver the effective self regulation that I have set out. In my judgment, this provides the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">least intrusive method of ensuring some form of adequate independent regulatory oversight</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of press standards for the future. Possibly for the first time in our history, it provides real</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">incentives for the press to organise and thus deliver genuine effective independent regulation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the public interest.</span>
