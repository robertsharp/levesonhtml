<h1>CHAPTER 9<br/>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A SELF-REGULATORY BODY</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Earlier in this Part of the Report,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> I set out my recommendations for independent self-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation. In that Chapter, I make it clear that I do not consider that it is my role to set the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards that should be applied by an independent regulatory body, but that setting those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards should be the role of that body, in consultation with the industry and with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wider public.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, within the evidence given during the course of this Inquiry, I have inevitably heard</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">much which bears on what those standards are or should be and how they might be made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more relevant and effective. In this Chapter, I have collected together some of the explicit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations that I have made and, in addition, some other ideas which I express in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the form of a recommendation that the industry and any putative independent regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body should be prepared to consider. The use of this different language is very deliberate:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by making a recommendation that consideration should be given to an issue, I am doing no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more than seeking to assist by identifying to the industry features that it should be prepared</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to consider. In this regard, it is not my intention to direct.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On some of these additional issues, I have strong personal views, and on others less so. On</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all of them, I accept entirely that they are matters that should be properly considered by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry in its own attempt to demonstrate to the public that it has taken both seriously and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to heart the public concerns that have been expressed over the recent past and by the new</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory body as part of a standards setting process.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This Chapter does not introduce any new ideas. All that appears has been derived from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence presented to the Inquiry and analysed in the Report. I do not therefore reproduce</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that evidence or any analysis here; references go back to the relevant Chapters of the Report</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and are mostly to be found in the earlier Chapters of Part F.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. Recommendations to a new regulatory body</h2>
<h3>Internal governance</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The point has been made that the current practice has the effect of encouraging publishers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to rely on the PCC to deal with complaints rather than putting in place processes to deal with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them effectively in-house. I have already recommended that a new regulatory system should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">require from each subscribing member of the body:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) an adequate in-house complaint process which should be exhausted before a complaint</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can be taken to the regulator; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) an annual return to be made to the regulator in relation to compliance so as to make</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transparent the extent to which complaints have been made and the way in which they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been handled.</span>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref1" name="footnote1" title="Go back to footnote reference 1 in the text">1</a>.  Part K, Chapter 7</p><!--footnote-->
 <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">I also recommend that a new regulatory body should consider requiring:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">(a) that newspapers should publish their annual compliance reports in their own</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">pages to ensure that their readers have easy access to the information;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> and</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">(b) as proposed by lord black, that a named senior individual within each title</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">should have responsibility for compliance and standards.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></span>

<h3>Incentives to membership</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have recommended earlier in Part K some incentives to membership that would benefit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those who joined a new regulaory body. A number of other incentives were suggested by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other witnesses to the Inquiry. Of these:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">I recommend that a new regulatory body should consider establishing a kitemark for</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">use by members to establish a recognised brand of trusted journalism.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></span>

<h3>The Code</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There has been a lot of support for the current Editors&#8217; Code. However, issues have also been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identified with it. I have made the points that in order to provide an ethical framework for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editors and journalists to work within, it needs to set the ethical and legal context in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it applies, and that it must do so in a clear and practical way. I would not want to lose any of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the positive elements of the existing Code, but given those two broader points and the broad</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">swathe of evidence that I heard:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">I recommend that a regulatory body should consider engaging in an early thorough</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">review of the Code with the aim of developing a clearer statement of the standards</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">expected of editors and journalists.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> It is important that the public should be engaged</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">in that review.</span>

<h3>Powers and sanctions</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC does not consider complaints while any relevant legal action is pending. I remain to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be convinced that there is any particularly unique problem associated with defamation that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">makes it impossible for court and regulatory action to be taken simultaneously. It seems, of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">course, reasonable that either the regulator or a court should be able to stay the regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">action if proceeding in parallel would create a risk of injustice, but that is no reason for a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">blanket ban on the regulator considering regulatory issues without waiting for any legal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">action first to be completed: such an approach would be in line with the approach adopted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in other cases of parallel civil and regulatory action. Lord Black agreed that a new regulator</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should, at least, be willing to allow a complaint to be heard prior to legal action.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">I recommend that a regulator should take the view that a complainant can bring a</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">complaint prior to taking legal action if that is the desired course of action. Challenges</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">to that approach can be decided on the merits.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></span>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref5" name="footnote5" title="Go back to footnote reference 5 in the text">5</a>.  Part K, Chapter 7, para 4.20; it would be particularly worthwhile to give consideration to the evidence that wasprovided to the Inquiry both in witness statements and orally, but specifically deployed on 16 July 2012</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref6" name="footnote6" title="Go back to footnote reference 6 in the text">6</a>.  Part K, Chapter 3, para 5.14</p><!--footnote-->
 <p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry heard a substantial amount of evidence relating to the allegedly discriminatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">treatment of women and minorities in the press. I have already recommended that a new</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory body must have the power to take complaints from third parties and representative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">groups. This may equip a regulator sufficiently to deal with this issue to the extent that they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deem necessary. However:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">I recommend that consideration should also be given to Code amendments which,</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">while fully protecting freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, would equip</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">that body with the power to intervene in cases of allegedly discriminatory reporting,</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">and in so doing reflect the spirit of equalities legislation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have reflected the arguments around whether the independent body should have the power</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to award compensation and conclude that there are real risks that doing so would make the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system unwieldy and ineffective. In addition, the arbitral system that I have recommended</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would provide swift financial redress in relation to breaches of the civil law. I therefore</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommend that a regulatory body should not seek the power to award compensation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have already recommended that a regulatory body should have the power to levy fines in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to serious or systemic breaches of standards. This raises the question of what should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">happen to any such payments. It would be inappropriate for the income from fines to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">used to fund the day to day operation of the regulator because of the incentives that would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">create. The solution proposed by Lord Black is that any fines should be paid into a ringfenced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforcement fund that would finance subsequent investigations. I agree that this appears to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be an acceptable way of dealing with the issue and:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">I recommend that a new regulatory body should establish a ringfenced enforcement</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">fund, into which receipts from fines could be paid, for the purpose of funding</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">investigations.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup></span>

<h3>Protecting the public</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC attracted plaudits for its services in relation to providing &#8216;desist&#8217; notices in cases</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where individuals have made it known that they do not welcome press intrusion. This service</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is seen by many as valuable and can be particularly helpful to vulnerable people at a difficult</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">time.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">I recommend that a new regulatory body should continue to provide a service to warn</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">the press, and other relevant parties such as broadcasters and press photographers,</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">when an individual has made it clear that they do not welcome press intrusion.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There have been concerns expressed about the behaviour of press photographers and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication of photographs taken at a time, or in a way, that breaches the Editors&#8217; Code.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is obviously a limit to the extent to which a press self-regulatory body can impact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the behaviour of photographers from agencies or of freelance photographers. However,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press must remain responsible for the content it publishes regardless of its source.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is important therefore that publishers should ensure that they only use information or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographs provided by third parties that were obtained ethically.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref7" name="footnote7" title="Go back to footnote reference 7 in the text">7</a>.  Part F, Chapter 6, para 8.22</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref8" name="footnote8" title="Go back to footnote reference 8 in the text">8</a>.  Part K, Chapter 3, para 5.10</p><!--footnote-->

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref9" name="footnote9" title="Go back to footnote reference 9 in the text">9</a>.  Part K, Chapter 7, para 4.39</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref10" name="footnote10" title="Go back to footnote reference 10 in the text">10</a>.  Part K, Chapter 7, para 4.35</p><!--footnote-->
 <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">I recommend that a new regulatory body should make it clear that newspapers will</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">be held strictly accountable, under their standards code, for any material that they</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">publish, including photographs (however sourced).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></span>

<h3>The public interest</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The way in which a regulatory body understands and applies the concept of the public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will be of great importance both to the newspapers themselves, and to the public and those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who are the subjects of journalism. There would be benefit from a greater measure of clarity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">over that interpretation.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">I therefore recommend that a regulatory body should provide guidance on the</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">interpretation of the public interest that justifies what would otherwise constitute a</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">breach of the Code. this must be framed in the context of the different provisions of</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">the Code relating to the public interest, so as to make it easier to justify what might</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">otherwise be considered as contrary to standards of propriety.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The question also arises as to how judgments on the public interest are taken within editorial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">teams and how the proper thought process can be demonstrated to the regulator should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the need arise. The obvious and simple solution to this is that the publisher should make</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a contemporaneous note of the issues raised and the consideration given to them. This is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an issue that has already been to some extent addressed by the Code Committee, and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Editors&#8217; Code now says:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Whenever the public interest is invoked, the PCC will require editors to demonstrate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fully that they reasonably believed that publication, or journalistic activity undertaken</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with a view to publication, would be in the public interest and how, and with whom,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that was established at the time.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-12"><a href="#para2-12" name="para2-12">2.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I recommend that:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">a new regulatory body should consider being explicit that where a public interest</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">justification is to be relied upon they would expect to see a record of the factors</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">weighing against and in favour of publication, along with a record of the reasons for</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">the conclusion reached.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It has been suggested that some editors might find it helpful, in particularly difficult cases, to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be able to seek advice prior to publication on issues surrounding the approach to a relevant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest question. I recognise that any requirement to seek pre-publication advice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be a constraint on freedom of speech and is simply not appropriate but, on the basis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the decision is always one for the editor, it seems to me that what is no more than the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opportunity to seek such advice offends neither those rights nor editorial independence.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">I therefore recommend that a new regulatory body should consider whether it might</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">provide an advisory service to editors in relation to consideration of the public interest</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">in taking particular actions.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>

 <h3>Access to information</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-14"><a href="#para2-14" name="para2-14">2.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry heard evidence of how the interpretation of some stories based on reports by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">third parties can be confusing. Medical and scientific stories were a particular concern. To</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further public understanding, I recommend that a new regulatory body should consider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">encouraging the press to be as transparent as possible in relation to the sources used for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories, including providing any information that would help readers to assess the reliability of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information from a source and providing easy access, such as web links, to publicly available</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sources of information such as scientific studies or poll results. This should include putting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the names of photographers alongside images. This is not in any way intended to undermine</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the existing provisions on protecting journalists&#8217; sources, only to encourage transparency</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where it is both possible and appropriate to do so.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></span>

<h3>Protecting journalists</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Hunt the current Chair of the PCC, suggested that there should be a whistleblowing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hotline into a new regulatory structure for those who feel that they are being asked to do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">things which are contrary to the Code. It is a shame that this has not been taken on board by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the industry proposal and</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">I recommend that a regulatory body should put such a mechanism in place.<span style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 9px;"> 16</span></span>

<p id="para-id-2-16"><a href="#para2-16" name="para2-16">2.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) and many others argued that journalists who comply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the code deserve some protection for doing so. I was struck that Rupert Murdoch, when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the idea of employment contracts including a conscience clause was put to him, did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">disagree.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">I recommend that the industry generally, and a regulatory body in particular, should</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">consider requiring its members to include in their contracts with journalist staff a</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">clause to prevent any disciplinary action being taken against a journalist as a result of</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">his or her refusing to do something which is contrary to the code of practice.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup></span>
