<h1>Chapter 8<br/>THE ALTERNATIVES</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. The issue</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have indicated above that a new regulatory regime needs to cover all main news publishers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if it is to be effective,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> and I have recommended a model for an effective independent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">self-regulatory system which I very much hope will be taken forward by the industry and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government and which I hope will secure the support of the whole industry.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, should that not be the case, and only in those circumstances, there would be a need</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for some mechanism to ensure that the advantages that the press enjoy in the public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are matched by responsibilities that are owed to the public. In other words, there should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some way that the press can be held to account on behalf of the public for the way it goes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about its business. I have been clear that it is my hope and expectation that this situation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will not arise. It can only do so if the press fails to deliver the independent regulation that is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">required and that the public have a right to demand. If, however, the industry were unwilling,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or unable, to come forward with a credible proposal for independent regulation then it would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have demonstrated sufficient disregard for the public interest to have established that self-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organised regulation simply is not an effective option. This Chapter looks at the issues that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would have to be addressed in order to provide such a mechanism and identifies the possible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">solutions.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I ought to make it clear that I do not believe that an approach involving direct independent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation necessarily constitutes a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> freedom</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> expression</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Armageddon</span> &#8221; (to use the Rt Hon</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Kenneth Clarke MP&#8217;s expression). I repeat that the issue arises only if the press deliberately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">refuse to set up a regulatory process that is undeniably independent of Government and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Parliament but is, equally, independent of the press itself; or, if such a system is set up but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does not have the support of the whole industry.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I set out here a very brief analysis of the issues which I think logically arise in that eventuality.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I do so for reasons of completeness, and so that no reader of this Report is unaware of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inescapable context which forms the background to the recommendations that I have made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the previous Chapter. There are no recommendations in this Chapter; it is simply a short</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">overview of the logical alternatives, as I see them, to the implementation of the model I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">put forward.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. The questions</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is extremely easy to say that everyone must participate in a new regulatory system, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relatively easy to fall back on the idea that, if they refuse, some type of statutory provision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may be necessary to ensure that outcome. It is more difficult to determine the shape and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substance of that statutory provision. I note that very few of the witnesses to the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have addressed themselves to this question at all, even where they accept that legislation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might well be needed. The first point to make is that any form of compulsion would require</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legislation. Undeniably, it is statutory regulation in stark form.</span>


 <p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are essentially four questions that need to be addressed in considering what statutory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provision might be required:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) what standards should be complied with?</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) what should be the consequences of failure to comply?</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) how should these consequences be applied? and;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) who should these provisions apply to?</span>

<a name="section3"></a>
<h2>3. What standards should be complied with?</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have already made it clear that I have no intention of trying to define the standards of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press conduct and ethics that should be applied. That is rightly a matter for an independent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory body, acting with the advice of the industry and following consultation with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public and others with relevant interests. I have also made it clear that I expect the standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">set by an independent regulatory body to cover governance and compliance procedures as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">well as conduct and ethical issues. The recommendations set out above establish the specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requirements that I consider should be met by an independent regulatory system in this</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">regard.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The issue considered here is the standard to be expected of those who choose to stay outside</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a self-organised independent system that meets those criteria, or in the event that no such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system emerged. There are a number of possible approaches.</span>
<h4>Enforcing legal requirements</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It has been argued that what is needed is not regulation of standards, but enforcement of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the law. I have explained why simple enforcement of the law, either through the application</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the criminal law or by civil proceedings through the courts, will not be a realistic solution</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to most of the problems identified by the Inquiry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> Having said that, those who argue for law</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforcement alone are correct that, for the most part, the contents of any likely &#8216;standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">code&#8217; are already, at a basic level, covered by the law.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, the virtue of an effective regulatory system is that, even if it does not seek to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">set standards at a level beyond the basic requirements of the law, it would be possible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to enforce those rights in a way that is more flexible and may not otherwise be possible.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Where a publisher declines to be part of an effective regulatory system, there is currently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no mechanism for effective enforcement even of standards equivalent to the law beyond</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reporting the matter to the police (if there is a basis for contending that the complaint is one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of crime) or commencing civil proceedings.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Under this analysis, the harm that arises as a result of publications choosing to sit outside a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory system, or the lack of existence of a regulatory system, is that victims are obliged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to fall back on the civil law process which is not designed to provide the type of speedy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">redress or rectification that is available to a regulator, but can be both slow and unsatisfactory;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">furthermore, it is unlikely to be a possible route for any other than the very rich and there is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no external monitoring of compliance with civil and criminal legal requirements.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It might reasonably be suggested that no publisher should be above the law, and that the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">simplest way of enforcing that principle would be for a standards code that simply looks</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">to reflect the existing law in terms of standards to apply and then rigorously enforces</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those standards. Essentially, if that was to be the case, what is suggested is that a statutory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator should be empowered to undertake regulatory enforcement of relevant civil rights</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and criminal wrongs with a zero-tolerance approach. By &#8216;regulatory enforcement&#8217; I mean</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the statutory body would: establish a standards code that requires no more or less than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compliance with legal obligations; determine whether standards have been breached; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apply appropriate sanctions. This rigorous regulatory enforcement would sit alongside the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">existing mechanisms of law enforcement but would be applied by the regulator, not the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">courts. All decisions taken by the regulator could be subject to appeal to the courts and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would, in any case, be subject to challenge by judicial review.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In order to be able to exercise such a role effectively the regulator responsible would need</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">new statutory powers to set and enforce regulatory standards that do not exceed the limits</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the law. In addition, it would need powers to obtain information about compliance.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These powers could take the form of the ability to conduct an audit to examine and make</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations about the compliance systems that a company has in place. The regulator</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would also need to be given investigatory powers in order to follow up complaints or reasoned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suspicion of breach of law. These powers might include the power to call for documents and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to hold hearings. In relation to enforcement powers, the regulator could be given the power</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to require publication of corrections and apologies in relation to defamatory material, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the power to impose regulatory fines (or civil penalties) in respect of defamation and other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breaches of law.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Some of these powers would be entirely new regulatory enforcement powers for existing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">law. Others, for example in relation to data privacy breaches, exist already, or would do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so if the recommendations that I have made in relation to the reform of the Information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner and the Data Protection Act are accepted. A good deal more work would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">required to identify the specific areas of law that such powers should cover and precisely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what powers such a regulator should have.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A regulatory system would offer access to victims to pursue their rights, albeit without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessarily pursuing a claim for the compensation that the law might allow; it could provide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a mechanism for standards oversight that criminal law enforcement cannot provide.</span>
<h4>Enforcing independently set standards</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-10"><a href="#para3-10" name="para3-10">3.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Many of the examples of unacceptable press behaviour that the Inquiry has seen concern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inaccuracy that is harmful to individuals or the public at large, and breaches of privacy of one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sort or another. Most clauses of the current Editors&#8217; Code fall under one of those headings or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the other. Those that do not (those relating, for example to reporting of crime and payment to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">witnesses and criminals) are in areas covered by criminal law. It might, therefore, be argued,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that an ethical standards code is unlikely to offer the public any more protection than the civil</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and criminal law, taken together, already do. This is not strictly true.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-11"><a href="#para3-11" name="para3-11">3.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the first place, the law only covers accuracy of published material to the extent that want</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of accuracy is defamatory (the threshold for which is presently under consideration in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Defamation Bill) or a contravention of the data protection regime. It is quite clear that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest in accuracy goes much wider than the case of personal information, and I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would expect an independent standards code to set that expectation. There is, however, no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legal mechanism to correct an inaccuracy other then when it is defamatory or a breach of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Data Protection Act. The current Editors&#8217; Code also makes provision for handling cases</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involving grief and shock in a sensitive way where there is no underlying legal requirement</span>
 <span style="font-size: 15px;">(unless a claim could be pursued for breach of privacy). In other areas, such as harassment,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the current Code provisions cover ground where there are legal standards but the Code does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not necessarily track those legal standards exactly, nor would it necessarily be desirable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it should do so. There are therefore gaps in the protection of the public interest, and in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasonable expectations of press standards, which the substantive law does not cover.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-12"><a href="#para3-12" name="para3-12">3.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Where a recognised independent regulatory system did exist, there would be one or more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognised independently-set standards codes in existence. These would have been subject</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to public consultation. It would be perfectly possible to apply the most appropriate of these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">directly to a publisher outside the system. This is broadly analogous to the model adopted by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom in relation to the Advertising Standards Authority, where Ofcom will, if necessary, take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforcement action against broadcasters who are in breach of the ASA broadcasting code.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If there were no such body at all, the regulator would have to issue its own code, doubtless</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">having given the industry the opportunity to provide input from the start and, ultimately,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">following open and transparent consultation both with the industry and the public.</span>

<a name="section4"></a>
<h2>4. What consequences should apply for breach?</h2>

<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is the main question that defines the impact of any compulsory regulation. What should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apply, and to whom it should apply are, to some extent, matters of technical detail. What</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">happens in respect of breach defines the nature of the statutory intervention. For some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulators, there is a power to disqualify or ban: it goes without saying that, if a publisher</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could be banned from publication as a result of breach, that would amount to a licensing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regime for the press which would be entirely unacceptable.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The options that I consider below are only those that I believe would be acceptable in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">democratic society and all respect the right of any publisher to publish any material. There</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is nothing here that would apply any form of prior restraint, or require any permission, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to publication. None of the options includes any form of state intervention in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">content published (save to the extent that a requirement to publish a correction impacts on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">content), or even in setting any standards that might apply to any content published.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> These</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">options relate solely to consequences after the event where standards (howsoever defined)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been breached.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Other than the first, which is the absence of consequences and included simply for the sake</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of completeness, each of these approaches would rely on the existence of statutory backstop</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator of some kind. They are set out so that they can be considered by all concerned with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this issue.</span>
<h4>Rely solely on benefits from membership of a recognised body</h4>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If there is no backstop regulator, the only effect of non-membership of a recognised body</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be the inability to access the benefits of that membership. Effectively, this would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a &#8216;do nothing&#8217; option. I have set out above<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> the statutory benefits that I consider should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apply to membership of a recognised body. These include the recognition by the courts of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commitment to high standards of behaviour and practice in connection with the issues that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arise in relation to aggravated and exemplary damages and also of a willingness to participate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in a fair, low cost, scheme to arbitrate disputes which is relevant to issues of costs.</span>



 <p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Conversely, those who are not members of such a regulatory body would face the risk of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">failing to demonstrate a commitment to high standards of behaviour (which could provide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material that justifies the award of aggravated or exemplary damages) and adverse costs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consequences of failing to participate in a system which permitted claimants to pursue their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rights in a fair, low cost system of alternative dispute resolution (ADR). Thus, if my earlier</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations are accepted, non-members might find that the court exercises its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discretion against making an order for costs even in the event that they had succeeded in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privacy or defamation defence.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These are, of course, consequences of not joining a regulatory system; they are not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consequencesattachedtospecificbreachesofstandards.Theonlymechanismforanindividual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to challenge a publisher outside the regulatory system would be by legal challenges relating</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to defamation, privacy or data protection. In the context of the changes to conditional fees,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this is unlikely to be a route open to most people, which is why I have recommended that if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no such scheme is set up, the Government should revisit the proposals made by Lord Justice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Jackson for one way qualified costs shifting.</span>
<h4>Name and shame</h4>

<p id="para-id-4-7"><a href="#para4-7" name="para4-7">4.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first and least intrusive approach for a backstop regulator would be no more than an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obligation and ability to monitor the performance of non-member publishers against the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant standards and governance requirements, and to make its findings public. In order</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be able to make meaningful reports, such a body would need to have the power to hear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints from individuals and reach conclusions on whether standards had been breached.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In order to provide any broader standards oversight, the body would need to have the power</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to investigate serious or systemic breaches of standards and to require information from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publishers to facilitate that.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-8"><a href="#para4-8" name="para4-8">4.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Onthis basis,theregulatorybackstopwouldbeunable tomakeanyrequirementofapublisher</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or impose any remedy for an individual: the only recourse for that individual would remain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">litigation. However, the body would itself be able to publish its conclusions on complaints and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">make public any concerns it had about standards in relevant publishers. A report of this sort</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could formally be made to Parliament.</span>
<h4>Complainants champion</h4>

<p id="para-id-4-9"><a href="#para4-9" name="para4-9">4.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is also the potential for an entirely different approach. In the absence of some sort</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of regulatory intervention, the only option open to an individual would be litigation, if that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were appropriate. It is theoretically possible for a backstop regulator (who could assume the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">naming and shaming role identified above) to take on the role of supporting complainants</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in taking legal action. A more extreme approach would be for the backstop regulator to take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legal action on behalf of complainants.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-10"><a href="#para4-10" name="para4-10">4.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are, however, two rather obvious problems with this proposal. The first is the cost. Even</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the cost proposals set out in Section 4, it is likely that this would be an expensive option.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is inevitable that sometimes claims would fail; indeed, it would be a poor service if the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only claims the regulator pursued were those guaranteed to succeed. The regulator would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">need some means of determining which cases to pursue as it would be both impractical and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">improper to take forward any complaint, however unlikely to succeed.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-11"><a href="#para4-11" name="para4-11">4.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second substantive problem here is that the state, however constituted, does not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generally seek to enforce the civil rights of citizens and it is difficult to see why it should do so</span>
 <span style="font-size: 15px;">in this area, as opposed to many others. There are serious concerns about access to justice in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a wide variety of contexts; the legal aid budget is already overstretched, with the areas of law</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in which legal assistance is provided under constant review. It is extremely difficult to see why</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the state should be prepared to enforce these (as opposed to many other) private law rights.</span>
<h4>Apply standards with enforcement powers</h4>

<p id="para-id-4-12"><a href="#para4-12" name="para4-12">4.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The final level would simply be to apply standards to all news publishers in the same way. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could be achieved in one of two ways. The first would be to require all relevant publishers to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bound by a recognised independent regulatory body such as the type I have recommended.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, this approach is not itself without difficulty for a number of reasons.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-13"><a href="#para4-13" name="para4-13">4.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, it is important to emphasise that if the press come together to organise an independent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory body (albeit in such a way that satisfied certain statutory requirements) the result</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is not itself a statutory body of any sort. It will be recognised by statute but it will not have any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statutory powers. The Report does not propose statutory regulation of the press but, rather,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">self-organised independent regulation of the press, both elements of which (self organised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and independent) are significant. It means that it would be wrong to give the body statutory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">jurisdiction of any sort. Equally, it would be wrong to require any individual publisher to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">become a member of a &#8216;self-organised&#8217; body organised by others.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-14"><a href="#para4-14" name="para4-14">4.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The alternative, second way is that some other regulatory body (a &#8216;backstop regulator&#8217;)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should apply a standards code directly to press publishers who choose not to become part</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a recognised system. Under this approach the backstop regulator would need, by statute,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be given enforcement powers to carry out investigations, to require publication and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">placement of corrections and apologies, and to levy fines in respect of serious or systemic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breaches and in default of compliance with its orders. The backstop regulator would then be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in a position to apply an appropriate level of regulation to those who do not voluntarily sign</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">up to a recognised independent system. As described above, the standards applied could be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a code that simply reflects the requirements of the law, or it could go further and apply the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">most appropriate code or, in default, a code that it had prepared after suitable consultation.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-15"><a href="#para4-15" name="para4-15">4.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is important to repeat that no backstop regulator should be given any powers over published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">content, except in relation to apologies and corrections. At no point should the regulator be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">able to prevent publication of content. The regulator would have no right to see content</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ahead of publication and no right to require the publication of any content other than in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">respect of apologies and corrections. This would not be statutory regulation of what the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press could publish; rather, it would represent an after the fact review of press behaviour.</span>

<a name="section5"></a>
<h2>5. How should any consequences be applied?</h2>

<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I identified earlier that all options (except for &#8216;do nothing&#8217;) would require a backstop</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory body to undertake the proposed regulatory role. The role requires a strong, expert</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisation, capable both of understanding the balance between Article 8 and Article 10</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rights of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and of withstanding the pressure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the press would be bound to place on anyone in this position.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An obvious answer would be that Ofcom should be given the responsibility of the role, not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">least because it is an established regulator, well able to understand the issues and address</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">them. I am aware of the attitude of the press towards Ofcom but there is absolutely nothing</span>
 <span style="font-size: 15px;">in the way in which I have seen that it exercises its regulatory functions to suggest that it does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not do so entirely appropriately and fully in accordance with its legislative mandate.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-3"><a href="#para5-3" name="para5-3">5.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom has an internationally high reputation<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> as a telecommunications regulator, and has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been described by the Rt Hon Ed Vaizey MP, Minister for Culture, Communications and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Creative Industries, as &#8216;doing an outstanding job&#8217;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> The broadcasters who have given evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Inquiry have not suggested that Ofcom (which directly regulates the independent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">broadcasters, occupying a slightly different position in relation to the BBC) has ever exercised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the slightest chilling effect in relation to the many examples of splendid investigative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalism that have been carried out over many years. For the avoidance of doubt, I am</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">equally clear that Ofcom would have no difficulty approaching its task with an eye to the very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different requirements of press regulation as contrasted with broadcast regulation, not least</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to the difference of position as to political neutrality.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-4"><a href="#para5-4" name="para5-4">5.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom would have to take on additional expertise from print journalism to assist in the task</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but, given that many broadcast journalists have also worked in the press, I do not believe that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom would be starting from a blank sheet. Much expertise is available to it and I have no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">doubt that it could perform the oversight task with a light touch but be ready to deal with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">egregious examples of conduct as and when it is necessary to do so. Both in the seminar</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and in evidence, the Chair, Dr Colette Bowe and Ed Richards, the chief executive of Ofcom,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">demonstrated a clear understanding of the line and I reject the suggestion that regulation by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom would mean the end of the free press or descent into state control of content.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-5"><a href="#para5-5" name="para5-5">5.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having identified Ofcom as the obvious answer, I must recognise that I have already</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommended that Ofcom should act as that body responsible for recognition and audit of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent regulatory press standards bodies. It might be suggested, therefore, that it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undesirable for one body to be responsible both for advising on the adequacy of the model</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for independent regulation that has been set up (against the statutory requirements) and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ultimately, if all else fails, for delivering the regulation itself.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-6"><a href="#para5-6" name="para5-6">5.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The issue could be argued both ways. First, it might be said that Ofcom could reject an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent regulator in order to take on the role of direct regulation. Second, and in quite</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the opposite direction, it is just as plausible to argue that Ofcom might actually be inclined</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to approve any independent regulator that comes forward in order to avoid taking on highly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">controversial role of regulating the press directly.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-7"><a href="#para5-7" name="para5-7">5.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For my part, I do not believe that this dual role necessarily creates any real difficulty. I do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not see why it should not be possible to require Ofcom at all times to aim for independent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">self-organised regulation, whilst nonetheless having to be able to demonstrate how any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognised regulator meets the statutory criteria. As a statutory regulator, Ofcom is required</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to operate with full transparency and could be obliged to publish not only its decisions on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognition, but also the reasoning for its decisions, thus ensuring that there is no opportunity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for competing incentives in relation to a backstop regulatory role to influence a decision on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognition of an independent regulator.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-8"><a href="#para5-8" name="para5-8">5.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For the sake of completeness I should mention what could be the alternatives. First, it would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be possible to extend the remit of the Information Commissioner. There are some advantages</span>



 <span style="font-size: 15px;">to this idea. The Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO) has many of the relevant powers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">already, as well as the expertise in balancing the considerations raised by Articles 8 and 10</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the ECHR. However, for the reasons I have set out in Part H, I do not see this as an obvious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">solution. Any attempt to give this role to the ICO would require restructuring and substantial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strengthening of the office, together with giving the Information Commissioner new duties</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and responsibilities to ensure that sufficient priority was given to the role.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-9"><a href="#para5-9" name="para5-9">5.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The final option would be to create a new regulator to undertake the role. To my mind, this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is the least satisfactory. Creating a new, self-standing, authority would take time. It would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">likely to be the most expensive option; it would have no established authority or reputation.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Without appropriate support, it would also be vulnerable to pressure.</span>

<a name="section6"></a>
<h2>6. To whom should any provision apply?</h2>

<p id="para-id-6-1"><a href="#para6-1" name="para6-1">6.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have referred throughout this section to &#8216;news publishers&#8217;. In practice if there were to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any requirement for certain organisations to meet prescribed standards in carrying out their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">activities, then it would be necessary to define quite precisely who those organisations are.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are two elements to this question. The first, and most basic, is how it is possible to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">distinguish the types of organisation that it is considered should be included within a new</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory system. The second, once a definition has been decided, is whether everyone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within that definition should be covered, or whether there is an argument for some sort of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">size threshold. I will deal with these two issues separately.</span>
<h4>Definitions</h4>

<p id="para-id-6-2"><a href="#para6-2" name="para6-2">6.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has had limited help on this matter from witnesses. Some have argued that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">difficulty of defining who should be covered by any legislation is a sufficient argument in itself</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for not imposing a legislative solution.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-3"><a href="#para6-3" name="para6-3">6.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Current definitions are an obvious starting point. Membership of the PCC is purely voluntary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the PCC says<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> that it deals with editorially controlled material in UK newspapers and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">magazines and their websites. The PCC does not cover any newspapers or magazines that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">do not subscribe to the Press Board of Finance (PressBoF), and hence has not had to grapple</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the issue of definitions in relation to whether a particular publication should be a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">member if it does not wish to do so. National newspapers pay the levy through the National</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Periodical Association, whilst regional newspapers and magazines are invoiced individually.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">No evidence is available on how PressBoF identifies publications to invoice, though it seems</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">likely that this is done via the relevant industry bodies, or what they do when publications do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not choose to pay. There is no publicly available list of those publications that are covered by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC, nor any list of publications which are not.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-4"><a href="#para6-4" name="para6-4">6.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One, albeit partial, source would be a definition of &#8216;newspaper&#8217; or &#8216;the press&#8217;. Dictionary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">definitions of &#8216;a newspaper&#8217; tend to include reference to the fact that it is printed,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> that it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is published at regular intervals, and that content includes articles on the news, editorials,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">features, reviews and advertisements. Definitions of the &#8216;press&#8217; tend simply to refer to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publications and periodicals. Definitions of the media go much more widely and bring in</span>




 <span style="font-size: 15px;">broadcasting and, sometimes, the internet. An approach based on defining terms of this sort</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does not, therefore, appear promising.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-5"><a href="#para6-5" name="para6-5">6.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An alternative approach, in seeking to identify the scope and coverage of a new regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system, would be to identify what activity it is that gives rise to the need for regulation.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The harm that the Inquiry has heard described relates primarily to the process of gathering</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information about individuals, the use of private information and the publication of inaccurate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information. It is these areas (conduct in the gathering of information, respect for privacy,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and accuracy) that I have recommended should by covered by a standards code in the new</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory system. It follows that the coverage of a new regulatory system should encompass</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those who undertake activities likely to involve those three processes. It may therefore be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate to attempt to build a definition based around: the gathering of information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about people and current affairs, for the purpose of, or in relation to, publication of news and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information; and the publication of information about people and current affairs.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-6"><a href="#para6-6" name="para6-6">6.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One way of looking at this would be to develop a concept of &#8216;press like services&#8217; along the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">model already used in relation to audiovisual media services, where regulation applies to &#8216;TV-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">like services&#8217;. Whether or not a service fell within the definition would be determined by any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">backstop regulator, but subject to appeal or review.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-7"><a href="#para6-7" name="para6-7">6.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A definition of this sort would be targeted on the behaviour that gives rise to concern and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would certainly include newspapers and relevant magazines. Such a definition should also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apply to those to whom information gathering is subcontracted, such as picture agencies</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and private investigators (although only when working for clients who would themselves be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">included by virtue of their publication activities).</span>

<p id="para-id-6-8"><a href="#para6-8" name="para6-8">6.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As set out above, however, the definition would also include broadcasters and internet sites</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which cover news or celebrity issues. Whilst it is important to ensure that the coverage of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">new regulatory system is sufficiently wide to prevent it being evaded purely by restructuring or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">redefining what an organisation does, it is also important to avoid any conflict or unnecessary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and unhelpful overlap between regulatory systems. In this context, it would be sensible to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">say that any activities that are regulated by Ofcom under the Broadcasting Code, or by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Authority for Television on Demand (ATVOD), under the Audio Visual Media Services (AVMS)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Directive, should not fall to be regulated under the new system. It would clearly be very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important, however, for the boundaries between those systems and the new system to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">looked at very carefully, and for the relevant regulators to work together to avoid conflict or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gaps in coverage.</span>
<h4>A size threshold</h4>

<p id="para-id-6-9"><a href="#para6-9" name="para6-9">6.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Arguments have been made from two perspectives about the extent to which any regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system should apply to companies of all sizes engaged in &#8216;press like services&#8217;. First, and at a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">level of regulatory policy, a number of regulators have made the case that regulation should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be proportionate and that some form of<span style="font-style:italic"> de</span><span style="font-style:italic"> minimis</span> exemption would be appropriate to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exempt those companies that are so small that the regulatory requirements would not be a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proportionate response to the potential harm caused by unregulated behaviour.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-10"><a href="#para6-10" name="para6-10">6.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, it has been argued that it makes sense to concentrate any required remedies on large</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">companies:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></span>



 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Large news publishers have voices far louder, with significantly greater impact than</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any individual. They have the power to frame and influence public opinion and public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">understanding. They also have exceptional power to seriously harm private citizens</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">through their influence.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is further argued that making some form of standards regulation compulsory only for large</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">companies, as well as concentrating the remedy on the source of the harm, would distinguish</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between freedom of expression, which would remain entirely unconstrained, and &#8216;corporate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">speech&#8217; which &#8216;due to its power and influence ought to be accountable&#8217;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-11"><a href="#para6-11" name="para6-11">6.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The arguments for some form of<span style="font-style:italic"> de</span><span style="font-style:italic"> minimis</span> exemption are strong. There will be few</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who think that a parish magazine or small newsletter should be compulsorily subject to a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory system. Such publications will simply never have the resources to join a regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body, or to provide the sort of internal governance systems and compliance returns that are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate for much larger organisations. Equally, they are unlikely to give rise to the level</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of harm that a substantially larger publisher might. On the one hand, it is possible for a very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">small organisation to make some defamatory remark or breach privacy and they are, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should remain, subject to the law should they do so. However, the worst harm is done to an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual, or society, once those inaccuracies or defamations are published and read more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">widely. The most significant damage is done by the use of the megaphone and the power of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">large brands to influence public understanding and opinion.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-12"><a href="#para6-12" name="para6-12">6.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thus the principle of setting a size related limit above which regulation should apply is simple</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enough. The difficult question, inevitably, is where that limit should be set.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-13"><a href="#para6-13" name="para6-13">6.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This could be looked at in two ways. First, a simple economic measure could be considered.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This could take into account revenues, market share and circulation. The Media Standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Trust suggests that companies meeting the definition of a small company or group for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">purposes of the Companies Act 2006 should remain outside regulation. Another suggestion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was that any company not large enough to be required to register for VAT should be exempt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from regulation.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-14"><a href="#para6-14" name="para6-14">6.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The alternative approach would be to consider a measure based more on the impact and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">influence of a publication. I have argued that a free press is important because of the influence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it can have over the nation&#8217;s understanding of issues and events.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup> That importance has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attracted privileges that the press can rely on in terms of privileged access to Parliament and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the courts, privileged protection for sources, privileged exemptions from the data protection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regime and privileged defences in relation to defamation. It must also be the case that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">influence and privileges of the press bring some form of accountability.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-15"><a href="#para6-15" name="para6-15">6.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has heard from editors that they are accountable to their readers, and, to no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">small extent, on a commercial basis to their shareholders or proprietors. But accountability</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the paper&#8217;s own readership cannot be confused with accountability to the public more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generally in relation to activities that go wider than their influence on readers: that is because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the activities that are the subject of complaint relate to the treatment of third parties or the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication of inaccurate or defamatory material.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-16"><a href="#para6-16" name="para6-16">6.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Effective independent regulation would provide a level of accountability in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards that would not in any way interfere with the freedom of an editor to publish any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material that he or she wanted to publish, but would encourage governance systems, to</span>



 <span style="font-size: 15px;">avoid legal and standards breaches, and generate potential consequences should standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be breached.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-17"><a href="#para6-17" name="para6-17">6.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Using this rationale for independent standards regulation, it follows that, when considering</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who should not be able to opt out of standards regulation, the measure to be used should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a materiality threshold based on influence. The Report sets out elsewhere the issues involved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in measuring the relevant parts of the media market to understand whether there is sufficient</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">plurality in the market.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-18"><a href="#para6-18" name="para6-18">6.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In that Chapter, I refer to the various metrics that Ofcom proposes using to measure plurality,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including availability, consumption and impact. It is entirely possible that some similar</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">combination of measures of influence, in particular consumption and impact, would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate in considering whether it would be proportionate for a news publisher to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expected not to be able to opt out of compliance with independently set standards.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-19"><a href="#para6-19" name="para6-19">6.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is a complex and technical question and my only purpose is to identify the options. Either</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of these approaches might serve as a starting point, but, if the Government were to find it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary to put a system of backstop regulation in place, I would recommend that they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should conduct a detailed consultation on the matter of precisely where and how the line</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be drawn: that is precisely the type of line that Ofcom would be able to draw.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-20"><a href="#para6-20" name="para6-20">6.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is my clear view that, wherever the line is to be drawn, all the national daily and Sunday titles</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should fall within the regulatory system. Equally, regional and local titles with a significant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">readership should be included within the system. It is more difficult to be clear about what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">types of online service clearly should be inside or outside of a regulatory system. However, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would clearly be appropriate that websites providing news coverage aimed substantially at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a UK audience, with a substantial stable audience should be covered by any new regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">system.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-21"><a href="#para6-21" name="para6-21">6.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Any definitions would need to apply at the group level, to ensure that where there are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">many small publications under the control of one organisation they are potentially included</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within the regulatory system. This could place differential costs of regulatory compliance on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent local or regional titles and those of their competitors that are part of a larger</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">group. Although I recognise the need for consultation, on the face of it, it is not unreasonable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to expect a publishing group of any size to be able to institute appropriate governance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mechanisms that might not be necessary or proportionate in the case of much smaller and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">simpler operations. The aim of putting a size threshold on the regulatory system would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to ensure that regulation was not disproportionate and did not act as a barrier to freedom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of expression, not to provide a route to evasion for those who should be within the system.</span>

<h2>7. My views</h2>

<p id="para-id-7-1"><a href="#para7-1" name="para7-1">7.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A backstop regulator would only be required if either the whole of the press industry had failed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to accept the principle of independent regulation and thus failed to organise an independent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body meeting the proposed statutory requirements or a significant proportion of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(and, in particular, any of the national press) had refused to engage with an independent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator. This would be a serious indictment of the ability and willingness of the industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to engage with standards regulation by any means short of direct compulsion and, as I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said, would undeniably reinforce the need for some statutory system of standards to be put</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">in place.</span>


 <p id="para-id-7-2"><a href="#para7-2" name="para7-2">7.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I repeat, as I have made very clear that, by a very long way, my preferred solution, and hence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">my recommendation, is that the industry should come together to construct a system of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent regulation that could be recognised. If it does so, there will be no need for a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">backstop regulator.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-3"><a href="#para7-3" name="para7-3">7.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, if some or all of the industry were not prepared to adopt that position, I do not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accept that they should expect the public to settle for less, much less escape standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation altogether. More significantly, if the possibility exists that a significant provider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of press like services could avoid independent regulation without consequence, then there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would simply be no incentive for an unwilling industry collectively to deliver it. My personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view, therefore, is that there may be a need for the realistic prospect of a backstop regulator</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being established.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-4"><a href="#para7-4" name="para7-4">7.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I think it is reasonable and proportionate to expect all publishers to comply with the standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of conduct required by the law. I also think it reasonable and proportionate to require the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press, which enjoys many benefits in the public interest, to accept the obligations of the sort</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of public interest standards, over and above the minimum requirements of the law, which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they have already described to some extent in their past codes, and which they purport to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">take seriously and live up to. These standards must reinforce the rights of free speech and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press to pursue whatever stories that they consider appropriate in whatever way they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">see fit; they must also respect the legitimate rights and interests of the public, individually</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and collectively.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-5"><a href="#para7-5" name="para7-5">7.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, in relation to the consequences of failure to comply, I am sure that they would have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to exist and must be real. I therefore do not consider that it would be appropriate to adopt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the &#8216;do nothing&#8217; option, relying only on generic incentives to encourage membership of an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent regulatory body. Neither do I consider that simple publication by a regulator of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an adverse judgment would be sufficient. The provision of a &#8216;complainants champion&#8217; service</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might be useful in relation to those who suffer breach of their civil rights by the media, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this would be an expensive and partial solution to the problems posed by standards breach.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In my opinion it would be better that some statutory backstop regulator be given the powers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to enforce standards, including powers to require publication of apologies and corrections,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the power to investigate concerns of serious standards breach and the power to impose fines</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(proportionate to the gravity of any breach and the means to pay) in respect of serious or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">systemic breaches of standards (or failure to publish a required apology or correction).</span>

<p id="para-id-7-6"><a href="#para7-6" name="para7-6">7.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Third, in respect of who should apply these consequences, my clear expectation is that Ofcom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be given this role: it is by far and away the best placed to do so.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-7"><a href="#para7-7" name="para7-7">7.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, in respect of these to whom provisions should apply, I would consider that the basic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concept of &#8216;press like services&#8217; as described above should be considered. In addition, I do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">think it makes sense to apply backstop regulation, if required, only to those organisations of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a sufficient size, and with sufficient impact, to make accountability to society an important</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue. I would suggest that Ofcom would have to be tasked with developing appropriate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">metrics along the lines I have set out above.</span>
