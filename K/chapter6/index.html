<h1>CHAPTER 6<br/>TECHNIQUES OF REGULATION</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Part K, Chapter 1 sets out the criteria that I consider need to be met by any &#8216;new more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effective regulatory regime&#8217;. Chapters 2-4 look at specific proposals that have been made for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a new approach to regulation of press standards, and Chapter 5 looks at the way that other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">countries deal with press standards. This Chapter starts from a rather different position and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">looks at the theoretical framework for regulation. This does not purport to be a definitive text</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the theory of regulation; rather it is a brief look at the different ways in which regulation can</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be achieved and the circumstances that are conducive to different approaches to regulation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being effective.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. Regulatory options</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Terms of Reference talk about making recommendations for a new and more effective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">policy and regulatory regime and that it precisely what this Report aims to do. There has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been a lot of talk in the media and elsewhere about the regulation of the press versus self-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation of the press as though that were a binary choice. That is not an interpretation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that I accept. It seems to me that there is a wide spectrum of action that can be undertaken,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that, far from a binary option there is a continuum from no regulation at all, through</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to full statutory regulation: a solution can be accessed at any one of a number of points on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that range. This chapter considers, from a theoretical perspective, the various policy and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory tools that are available for use and looks at the pros and cons of each, though I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">must reiterate that this is a partial review of the options, not a thorough analysis.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At the opening of the Inquiry a number of briefing sessions were held that dealt with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">factual background against which the issues under consideration by the Inquiry should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seen. At one of those briefings Donald McCrae, an expert in regulatory theory, introduced a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">model for thinking about regulatory propositions.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> Specifically, he categorised the potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approaches to changing behaviour under four headings: engage, enable, encourage and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exemplify. At the same time the Inquiry heard from a number of regulators about different</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory regimes and about the different regulatory regimes for the press and the media in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other countries.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This Chapter starts by considering different ways of securing behavioural outcomes, drawing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on examples where that is helpful. This is a technical consideration of potential models and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">how they might operate.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">TheDepartmentforBusinessInnovationandSkills(BIS) setsoutgeneralprinciplesofregulation,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which requires that any regulation and enforcement framework should be capable of being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">implemented in a fashion which is demonstrably proportionate, accountable, consistent,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transparent, and targeted.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are various ways of categorising regulatory models. One way of doing so is to look at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the level of external intervention. This can be cut at almost any level of specificity but we</span>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref2" name="footnote2" title="Go back to footnote reference 2 in the text">2</a>.  BIS, Principles of Regulation, http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/bre/principles-of-regulation</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1734"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">have identified four levels which we go on to consider in more detail, namely no regulation,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">self-regulation, co-regulation and, finally, statutory regulation.</span>

<h3>No regulation</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This concept needs some clarification. For most people &#8216;no regulation&#8217; would mean no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specific regulation or laws relating to the press. However at present the media are bound by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the law as it applies to the rest of us. This includes many laws that could impact on the sorts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of behaviour in the press that have been complained of in evidence to the Inquiry, such as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA), under which the prosecutions for phone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking have been made, the Bribery Act 2010, the Fraud Act 2006, the Protection from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Harassment Act 1997 etc. Critically, the Human Rights Act 1998 provides rights both to a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private life and to freedom of expression. There are additional laws relating to press reporting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on criminal cases. The media are also subject to the Data Protection Act 1998, although there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is a specific public interest protection under section 32 for processing data with a view to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication for journalistic purposes.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">So the concept of &#8216;no regulation&#8217; should not necessarily be considered to mean that journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be able to operate unfettered by legal constraints.</span>

<h3>Pros and cons</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The principles of better regulation dictate that regulation should be &#8216;proportionate&#8217; &#8211; i.e. no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more than is required to achieve the policy objective. Clearly if it is possible to deliver the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">desired outcome in the absence of any regulation then no regulation should be introduced. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice this means that &#8216;no regulation&#8217; is an appropriate response when the market is capable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of delivering the required outcome without intervention. The very fact that this Inquiry had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be established, in the wake of discoveries of serious wrongdoing and criminality, in at least</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one national newspaper, is sufficient demonstration that the market alone will not provide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public protection from criminal acts which Parliament and the public have regarded with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">abhorrence, and which even those responsible for committing them have not sought to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justify in this Inquiry.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, the law has to be accessible for if there is limited prospect of detecting criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behaviour or being able to afford civil proceedings, to that extent, there is no sanction (or, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the absence of ethical standards) disincentive to comply with the law when to do otherwise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has potential advantages. Thus, if there is a good prospect of being able, say, to intercept</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mobile phone communications without being caught (because of the care taken to avoid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">alerting the victim and, in the absence of a victim, law enforcement will not be engaged)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the advantages to be obtained from listening to intercepted messages are sufficiently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">beneficial, the fact that others in the market do not engage in that behaviour will not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessarily prevent it.</span>

<h3>Self regulation</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are many different self-regulatory tools. This section considers self regulation in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">purest sense, where activity is entirely voluntary, where there is no constraint or oversight</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from outside of those self-regulating as to the standards that are set or monitoring or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforcement of compliance with them. There are a number of tools that could potentially fall</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">within the definition of self-regulation.</span>
<a name="page1735"></a><!--new page--><h4>Internal governance</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first is referred to as &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic"> internal</span><span style="font-style:italic"> governance&#8217;</span> ; these are the methods that organisations use</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to establish their own cultures and control behaviour within their own organisations. What</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">happens inside a company is a matter of culture, example, practice and control, and these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">internal governance practices and procedures are likely to have the most significant impact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the ethical standards applied by their employees and contractors.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-12"><a href="#para2-12" name="para2-12">2.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has been provided with extensive evidence from newspapers about systems that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they have in place to ensure compliance with ethical standards. Internal governance is likely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be very effective in circumstances where it is genuinely in the interest of the organisation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to secure compliance with the standards. It is less likely to be effective if there are competing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">incentives (for example if the financial benefits of breaching the standards are significant). To</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be effective, internal governance systems must be consistent, must be seen to be enforced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and must be seen to be exemplified throughout the organisation.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has also seen evidence<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> of many excellent systems of internal governance in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">place in both national and regional newspapers. It is noticeable that the formal governance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arrangements in the News of the World, prior to its closure, were effectively the same as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those for other titles in the News International Group, which are themselves similar to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">best examples of internal governance arrangements that we have seen. I draw two lessons</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from this. First, internal governance can have an important role to play but, second, formal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">internal governance procedures are not in themselves sufficient. It should also be noted that,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whereas the detail of day to day governance processes are very much a matter for companies</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individually, governance is not itself a purely self-regulatory matter as some elements of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">corporate governance are dictated by company law, or stock market listing requirements. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extent to which these rules impact on companies running newspapers is, of course, affected</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the different ownership structures which they enjoy.</span>
<h4>Industry standards</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-14"><a href="#para2-14" name="para2-14">2.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second purely self-regulatory tool is<span style="font-style:italic"> industry</span><span style="font-style:italic"> standards</span> . With a purely self-regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry standards model there is no compulsion for anyone to be a member, no oversight</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fromoutsidethemembershipofthestandardssetorenforcementprocedures,andnofallback</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">either where relevant bodies are not members or where the self regulatory standards are not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforced. This is the model currently in place with the Press Complaints Commission.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is worth noting that many professional bodies often regarded as &#8216;self-regulatory&#8217; (such as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the General Medical Council, the Solicitors&#8217; Regulatory Authority etc) are not self-regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at all. Their powers spring from legislation that restricts the practice of the profession and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gives the bodies the right to prevent those who fall sufficiently short of professional standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from practising the profession. Similarly, whilst the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA),</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which was suggested as a model of self-regulation<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> at one of the seminars held by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry, is a self regulatory body and architects do not have to belong to it, they do have to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be registered with the Architects Registration Board (ARB) in order to use the term architect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the ARB issues a code of professional practice and can take action against those who fail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to comply. For that reason, these models of professional regulation are not considered here.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-16"><a href="#para2-16" name="para2-16">2.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are many examples of industry groups who have come together to agree codes of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice that all are willing to adhere to. These codes are likely to require members to follow</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref3" name="footnote3" title="Go back to footnote reference 3 in the text">3</a>.  Part C, Chapter 2</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref4" name="footnote4" title="Go back to footnote reference 4 in the text">4</a>.  http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Presentation-by-Eve-Salomon-PDF-23.4KB1.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1736"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">particular courses of action; in the context of this report this is most relevant where the action</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is aimed at consumer protection. Such bodies may produce a kitemark or similar badge which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is intended to represent to the public that the members who are able to display the kitemark</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adhere to an appropriately high standard of behaviour in the course of their work, whatever</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that may be.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-17"><a href="#para2-17" name="para2-17">2.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is generally accepted that industry self-regulation is often more flexible and less costly for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both business and consumers than direct government involvement. There are two principal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasons for this. Industry experts can be expected better to understand their own processes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and capabilities and also have better insight into consumer needs and responses to their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular products or services than an outside or external regulator would. Self-regulation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also allows industry to adapt and react to technological and market change, and consumer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behaviour, at a speed that formal regulation can rarely match. If effective, this should result</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in better outcomes for both consumers and the industry.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-18"><a href="#para2-18" name="para2-18">2.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, for self-regulation to be effective there needs to be an appropriate alignment of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">incentives to make it so. In practice these incentives tend to be the existence of a market</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">need, and the absence of legal rules or regulation to address that need, coupled with a fear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the imposition of such rules would have a damaging effect on industry players. Ofcom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">research has found that most self-regulatory schemes have been established, at least in part,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in response to a perceived threat of state intervention.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> The PCC, established in the wake of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Calcutt Report in 1990, as the now notorious &#8216;last drink in the last chance saloon&#8217; is no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exception.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-19"><a href="#para2-19" name="para2-19">2.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For incentives to align, more is needed than simply the existence of a problem and a threat</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of state intervention. Self-regulation is more likely to be effective in those markets where:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a)<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;companies</span><span style="font-style:italic"> recognise</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> their</span><span style="font-style:italic"> future</span><span style="font-style:italic"> viability</span><span style="font-style:italic"> depends</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> only</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> their</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they operate; and;</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">identified harm or market failure, since this will improve the ability of those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">companies to determine the interests of citizens or consumers and, potentially,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">society as a whole .&#8220;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A fourth criterion could be added:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d)<span style="font-style:italic"> addressing</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> perceived</span><span style="font-style:italic"> harm</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> direct</span><span style="font-style:italic"> conflict</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span><span style="font-style:italic"> providing</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> desired</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">service to the companies&#8217; consumers.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-20"><a href="#para2-20" name="para2-20">2.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is worth exploring this concept a little further. Most self regulatory regimes are aimed at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dealing with the impact that the relevant organisations have on those who use their services,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or at least where the consumers of their services would be expected to disapprove of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impact concerned. Examples include Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) or other kite</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mark institutions, whose aim is to provide a guarantee of quality to consumers. It is in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interests of all members of a kitemark group to ensure that the standards promised by the</span>

<p id="para-id-2-21"><a href="#para2-21" name="para2-21">2.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A different example is the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) where Internet Service Providers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(ISPs) co-operate not only because the majority of their customers do not themselves want</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be exposed to images of child abuse, but also because it is very much in their interests not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be seen to be providing access to such images to those who do want to see them.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The potential for successful self regulation is reduced where the harm complained of is to a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">third party and does not obviously damage the interests of the companies concerned or their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consumers. Obvious examples of this would be the use of child labour, or casual dumping</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of waste leading to environmental damage. Such activities might lead to higher profits and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cheaper products, so pleasing both producers and consumers. The fact that they have a wider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">social cost that is not generally considered acceptable may be sufficient to prevent this type</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of behaviour but, equally, it may not be if the relevant company believes that it can achieve</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its ends (albeit causing the harm) in secret and without being detected.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-23"><a href="#para2-23" name="para2-23">2.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It might be argued that public concern over the wider social costs would be enough to lead</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to a successful self regulatory outcome, but the continued sale in the UK of products that are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made by child labour, or the production of which leads to environmental degradation in its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">country of production, whilst strict laws in the UK prevent such things from happening here,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is testament to the difficulty of achieving pure self-regulatory outcomes that might be in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the wider public interest, when direct consumer interests do not align with the wider public</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-24"><a href="#para2-24" name="para2-24">2.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A less extreme example might be online copyright infringement. The growth of the internet</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has led to widespread habits of sharing music and film (and increasingly books and magazines)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">onlinethroughinformal,unlawful,channelsratherthanbuyingthemfromlegitimatesites.This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is breach of copyright and deprives the creators and the creative industries of the legitimate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">revenue that they need to reinvest in the production of new content. The Government looked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for self-regulation among ISPs to find ways of preventing internet users from engaging in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these unlawful activities. However, the harm does not affect ISPs, and providing a solution</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was likely to be unpopular with their consumers who are precisely the people engaging in,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and (in their eyes) benefiting from, the unlawful behaviour. In the absence of a self regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">solution, Parliament passed legislation requiring action from ISPs because they believed the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wider public interest required a solution to be put in place even though neither the service</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">providers nor their consumers had any incentive to co-operate.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-25"><a href="#para2-25" name="para2-25">2.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The relevance of this final point to the situation with the press is obvious. The Inquiry has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">heard evidence that the PCC is good at some things, such as mediation, and not at all effective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to others.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> Similarly we have heard evidence from editors<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> that the continued</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">purchase of newspapers by the public is proof that the public is satisfied with the standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that obtain. We have also heard substantial evidence of the harm that newspaper behaviour</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has done to many individuals: these include some who have put themselves in the public eye</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deliberately, some who are there incidentally because of a famous friend or relative, some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who find themselves well known because of terrible things that happen to them and yet</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">others who become the subject of media interest purely by freakish chance. None of this is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about harm done to readers, that is to say the people whose purchasing decisions apparently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">tell the editors that they are making the right call; it is all about harm to third parties who</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">have no voice in that transaction.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has had representations from members of the public complaining more generally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the content of newspapers; the complaints include a diverse range of press activities</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such as the sexual objectification of women, the vilification of migrants and the abuse of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disabled.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> These cases also raise questions of a wider public interest than purely what any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given portion of the public might like to read about and therefore whether consumers are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">getting fair treatment. Harm of this sort is less susceptible to effective self-regulation than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">harm as part of the producer/consumer contract.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-27"><a href="#para2-27" name="para2-27">2.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcomalsoarguesthatselfregulationismorelikelytobeeffectivewherecitizensorconsumers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and all other individuals share common views as to the merits of regulating the activities of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">companies to achieve a particular social objective. The vigorous debate that has raged over</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these issues as the Inquiry has gone about its business suggests that this criterion is not met</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to press regulation, in particular as it applies to privacy.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-28"><a href="#para2-28" name="para2-28">2.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, self-regulation will be more able to succeed in a market environment with active</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">participation by the industry. In those circumstances, cohesiveness is most likely to administer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effective self-regulation as industry participants are more likely to commit financial resources,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consult with stakeholders and monitor the effectiveness of self-regulation. This, at least in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">part, does appear to be the case in relation to the press, with the market having been able</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to sustain the existing funding mechanism for the PCC (through PressBoF) since its creation</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">in 1990.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-29"><a href="#para2-29" name="para2-29">2.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Self-regulatory industry bodies tend to have few sanctions other than expulsion from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body. Levels of monitoring of compliance and enforcement vary. There are various options</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as to how compliance could be monitored. One option is simply rely on members to comply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the relevant standards. A second would be to require self declaration of compliance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and a third would be to have independent verification of compliance and/or enforcement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mechanisms. The PCC runs a reactive approach, relying for the most part on members to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police their own compliance, with a reactive, complaints-based, enforcement mechanism</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and an Independent Review which can consider appeals concerned with the PCC process (but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not on the substance or merits of the complaint or the adjudication).</span>

<h3>User regulation</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-30"><a href="#para2-30" name="para2-30">2.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A further form of self-regulation is regulation by the user community. Many online services</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are seen to be self-policing. An obvious example is Ebay, in which users rate the service they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have had from members either as buyers or sellers in order to enable users to buy and sell</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with trust. Similarly the operators of other online sites invite users to self-police by reporting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breaches of terms and conditions, with the service provider which then takes action when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">notified. This mechanism can work well where it is in the interests of users to provide feedback</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on inappropriate behaviour, and where there are quick and simple mechanisms to do so. It is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thus a relatively good tool in some online environments but less likely to be effective in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">physical world.</span>

<h3>Co-regulation</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-31"><a href="#para2-31" name="para2-31">2.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Co-regulation means any form of self-regulation with some sort of external, independent,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">incentives, oversight or form of backstop. There are many different ways in which the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">backstop can be provided and they will have different impacts. These can include recognition</span>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref9" name="footnote9" title="Go back to footnote reference 9 in the text">9</a>.  Part F, Chapter 6, Section 8</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1739"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">of a self-regulatory body by Government, law or a statutory regulator; approval of codes by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government or a statutory regulator; and compulsory membership or funding arrangements.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Variations on each of these models exist in different sectors in the UK and elsewhere and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">model is almost infinitely variable. The basic variations are explored.</span>
<h4>Recognition of self regulation/regulatory backstop</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-32"><a href="#para2-32" name="para2-32">2.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The circumstances in which incentives might align to make self regulation effective are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described above. A further incentive for co-operation with self-regulation can be provided in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the form of recognition by the courts or a regulator of the process of self-regulation.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-33"><a href="#para2-33" name="para2-33">2.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) is an example of co-regulation, where the agency</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">act as the regulator in relation to both print and broadcasting advertising. In the case of print</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advertising, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has statutory powers to deal with misleading</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advertising and in the case of broadcast advertising, Ofcom has statutory powers through its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">licensing regime. However, both statutory regulators recognise the role of the ASA and only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">take action in relation to advertising issues when referred to them by the ASA. Specifically, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Control of Misleading Advertisements Regulations 1988 require the OFT, before considering</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a complaint about the misleading nature of an advertisement to satisfy itself that &#8216;such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">established means as the Director may consider appropriate&#8217; have been used and have not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dealt adequately with the complaint and that he should have regard to the desirability of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">encouraging the control, by self-regulatory bodies, of advertisements. The ASA does not,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">therefore, have statutory recognition itself, but the statute sets the framework within which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ASA can be given the space by the OFT to operate.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-34"><a href="#para2-34" name="para2-34">2.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This sort of approach has many advantages. First, it brings all the advantages of self regulation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(efficient regulation, speed of response, flexibility in the light of social and technological</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">change). Second, it provides an incentive for industry to comply with the standards and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rulings of the self-regulatory body since the alternative is to face a regulatory process with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator. Third, it provides an incentive for industry players to ensure that the self-regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body is credible, since the regulator can only accept the rulings of the self-regulatory body</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if that body deals satisfactorily with complaints. Finally, it provides a backstop in the case of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those parts of the industry which might chose not to comply with the standards or rulings of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the self-regulatory body but who are, none the less, subject to the law and to the jurisdiction</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the regulator.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-35"><a href="#para2-35" name="para2-35">2.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the other hand, this approach does require the basic ground rules to be set in legislation.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It requires the existence of a regulator capable of acting as a backstop and it leaves open the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">possibility of conflict between the regulator and any self-regulatory body over what standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should apply, within the legislative framework. A basic framework approach of this sort could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allow for two or more self-regulatory bodies running different codes or standards as long as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the regulator was content to recognise both, but it would also allow the regulator to favour</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one self-regulatory body over another.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-36"><a href="#para2-36" name="para2-36">2.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In practice, it may be felt that it is easier to arrive at an ASA model where a strong industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">self-regulatory body already exists, but requires some legislative underpinning in order to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ensure appropriate standards are set and maintained without exception across the industry,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than in the case where a new self-regulatory body would have to be called into being. In the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">absence of a credible self-regulatory body, the regulator might have to develop codes and</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards itself, in order to provide appropriate predictability, consistency and transparency</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the market. In the online copyright infringement example mentioned above, the legislation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requires Ofcom to seek to approve an industry code, but provides that in the absence of an</span>
<a name="page1740"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriateindustrycodeOfcomshouldimposeacodeofitsownthatmeetstherequirements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the statute. In that model, a structure which appears, on the face of it, to provide a co-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory approach in practice (depending on the circumstances) can end up delivering a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statutory regulatory outcome.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-37"><a href="#para2-37" name="para2-37">2.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is possible to imagine a lighter touch regime than the ASA version. For example, the courts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">couldberequiredorencouragedtoconsidercompliancewiththestandardsofaselfregulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body as a sufficient defence against a relevant complaint. For example, if a regulatory body</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">established a process for considering the existence of a public interest before engaging in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">activity that might otherwise constitute a breach of privacy then the courts might consider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that compliance with that process demonstrated (at least prima facie) sufficient grounds</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to give rise to reasonable view that the public interest was engaged and the intrusion was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legitimate.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-38"><a href="#para2-38" name="para2-38">2.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the one hand, a co-regulatory model can encompass anything that could be done under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">self-regulation whilst adding an element of compulsion to make effective enforcement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">possible. On the other hand, it can encompass anything that could be done by a statutory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator but put relevant decision making in the hands of those closest to the industry, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rigorously separate from Government, to seek to gain the benefits of self-regulation without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">losing the benefits of statutory backing. This is a model that is much in use in the UK. Most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">professional regulation is co-regulation by this definition where the practice of the profession</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(law, medicine, architecture etc) is protected by law and the professional bodies that, police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it do so with the statutory backing that allows them to rescind or refuse a license to practise.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Advertising is a well known example of successful co-regulation. Others include ATVOD,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PhonePayPlus and the ACAS Code of Practice on Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures.</span>

<h3>Statutory regulation</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-39"><a href="#para2-39" name="para2-39">2.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In this Report a reference to statutory regulation means a system where the scope and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">coverage of the regulation is set by statute. Again, there is a broad spectrum. At one end</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is the situation where the full detail of the regulation (in fact, law) is set by statute with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforcement by the police or otherwise through the courts. At the next level, is the regime</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">wheremostofthedetailoftheregulationissetbystatute,butwitharegulatoractingprimarily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as an enforcement body: many consumer protection regulations, with OFT regulating, fall</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into this category. Then there is the case where the regulator is established by statute and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given objectives to meet, along with the tools with which to do so, leaving the regulator to set</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the detail of the regulations, to make regulatory decisions and then to enforce them: most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sectoral regulators such as Ofcom, Ofgem, and Ofwat fall into this category. In some models</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the regulations set by the regulator might themselves need to be approved by Parliament. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">others the regulator is free to manage the regulatory regime without external oversight but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subject to appeal though an appropriate judicial body.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-40"><a href="#para2-40" name="para2-40">2.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Statutoryregulation,withthelegitimacyofParliamentarydebateandapproval,representsthe</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will of the people to impose certain standards of behaviour. Statutory regulation is primarily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">used to address circumstances where horizontal law is insufficiently precise to deliver the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">outcomes required and, where the nature of the problem to be resolved is such that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operation of the market is not likely to deliver the solution. This is the case, for example,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where there is a high degree of concentration within an industry, leading to the possibility of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">anti-competitive behaviour with negative impacts for consumers. It is also unlikely that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">market alone will provide appropriate consumer protection where companies take a short-</span>

<a name="page1741"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">term view of the factors influencing their viability and are focused predominantly on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest of their current customers and shareholders.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-41"><a href="#para2-41" name="para2-41">2.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Statutory regulation is an effective way of dealing with issues relating to the impact on third</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parties of activities outside the commercial relationship involved. Legislation can be used to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">require parties to take into account broader social or public interest issues that would not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">otherwise form a part of their commercial consideration of their interest. To express that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in more economic language, this is where external costs arising from the activities of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">companies are borne predominantly by sections of the society other than by the customers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of those companies and the companies themselves.</span>

<h2>3. Regulatory tools</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Theprevioussectionconsidersdifferentwaysinwhichregulationcanbedelivered.Thissection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aims to consider the types of tools that can be used. Most of these tools could form part of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any regulatory tool kit whether it was self-regulatory, co-regulatory or statutory regulation.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The purpose of regulation is to deliver an outcome that society wants. However, regulation is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not the only way to influence or change behaviour. I thus turn to the categorisation identified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by Mr McCrae of the different ways in which changes to behaviour can be encouraged and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">influenced, namely: enabling, engaging, exemplifying and encouraging.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">This includes removing barriers (of whatever sort) to the desired behaviour, giving information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and providing viable alternatives, including through capacity building, skills, training and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">facilities. Two different aspects of press culture have been raised with the Inquiry: on the one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hand, there is behaviour that breaks the law or is, in some other way, in breach of recognised,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accepted standards (which, in shorthand, I refer to as unethical), and on the other hand,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there is concern that the press is not sufficiently engaged in genuine investigative work. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry has not heard any evidence to suggest that there are barriers preventing lawful or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethical behaviour, as opposed to pressures encouraging unethical behaviour. The Inquiry has,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">however, heard arguments<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> that there are barriers in place that make it difficult for the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to pursue legitimate investigatory journalism, in particular current libel laws, the new Bribery</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Act and uncertainty over the interpretation of the public interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is no doubt that newspapers are largely operating in an increasingly challenging</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">economic environment, with the need to compete with 24 hour news and the internet.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Newspapers are now required not only to fill their printed pages on a daily (or weekly) basis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but also to provide constantly updated content on websites and they do this with reduced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">numbers of journalists. In this context, issues around resourcing and training of journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are clearly highly relevant.</span>
<h4>Engage</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Another route to changing behaviour is to leverage the enthusiasm and commitment of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interested parties. This involves community action, media, opinion formers and using</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">networks. There is clearly substantial interest from MPs, the public, academics and pressure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">groups in the issues of press culture and ethics.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has seen no evidence of a lack of engagement on the part of those outside of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the media. On the other hand the partial approach to reporting in the press either the extent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(or even the existence) of problems with press ethics has been exemplified by reporting of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the phone-hacking scandal from the very beginning. It is widely, and rightly, recognised that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there would not have been the public concentration on these issues of press culture and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethics had not an investigative journalist, (Nick Davies), with a support of national newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(The Guardian), not pursued phone-hacking determinedly. On the other side of the scale, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rest of the press, together with the PCC, were keen to paint the Mulcaire case as that of one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rogue reporter.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The nature of the problems identified by the Inquiry suggest that the tools of engagement,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whilst potentially complementary, are unlikely to be sufficient by themselves to change</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behaviour.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref10" name="footnote10" title="Go back to footnote reference 10 in the text">10</a>.  p21, lines 14-21, Nick Davi es, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-29-November-2011.pdfp2, Alan Rusbridger, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Alan-Rushbridger.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref11" name="footnote11" title="Go back to footnote reference 11 in the text">11</a>.  It is also possible to point to the way in which the Inquiry has been reported, in particular relating to the differentarguments for alternatives to improved self regulation along the lines proposed by PressBoF. The press is, of course,entitled to be partisan but the extent to which there has been any balanced discussion or analysis of the arguments is, at least, open to debate</p><!--footnote-->


<a name="page1743"></a><!--new page--><h4>Exemplify</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Exemplification includes leading by example and achieving consistency in policies. The Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has heard many references to examples of excellent journalism and adherence to excellent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethical standards within the British press. The Inquiry has, however, heard fewer instances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of use of such examples of excellence within the industry to promote ethical behaviour.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC receives complaints and, unless mediated, produces adjudications on them which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lead to reminders to papers and journalists of the nature of the code and the production of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">additional guidance on good behaviour.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has been told of many examples of excellent investigative journalism, ethically</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conducted, being lauded within the industry: examples include Thalidomide, phone hacking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and MPs expenses. However, on the other hand there appears to be no particular censure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for unethical behaviour: for example, even after the decision of Eady J awarding damages for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breach of privacy to Max Mosley, in which the activities of the chief reporter were heavily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criticised, the News of the World (NoTW) put that story forward for the title of scoop of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">year.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup> The NoTW did not win (the Times won the title that year) but the story suggests that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW did not expect accuracy or ethical standards to be a material factor in deciding the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">winner. Again, the nature of the problems the Inquiry has heard suggest that, whilst best</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice will certainly have a role to play, it is unlikely to be sufficient to address all concerns.</span>
<h4>Encourage</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-10"><a href="#para3-10" name="para3-10">3.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the context of this list of mechanisms to change behaviour, &#8216;encourage&#8217; includes all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory measures, including through the tax system, transparency requirements, penalties</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and enforcement measures and positive approaches such as reward schemes and targeted</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">grants.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-11"><a href="#para3-11" name="para3-11">3.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Some of these tools are rewards for good behaviour, others sanctions for bad. Some might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be seen to work both ways. Public money can be provided either to fully fund activity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seen as desirable (e.g. the BBC) or in other ways. Examples from the broadcasting sector</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">include Channel 4, which is publicly owned, and has historically been funded both by its own</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commercial income and by subsidies levied from other public service broadcasters and other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terrestrial broadcasters who have access to spectrum to broadcast and in return have to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meet public service broadcasting requirements.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-12"><a href="#para3-12" name="para3-12">3.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is less tradition of the state funding the press, though many local authorities publish</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newsletters which are distributed to the local population and which contain council news,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sometimes other local news and advertising. All books and newspapers are exempt from VAT,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whilst online publications are not. In addition Royal Mail operates a specific tariff (presstream)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for distribution of newspapers and magazines.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-13"><a href="#para3-13" name="para3-13">3.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Governments can provide public money for grants to encourage all sorts of behaviour, from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">grants for film production to the car scrappage payments, from the solar power feed-in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">tariff to help with starting up small businesses. Grants and other payments can be used to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">encourage behaviour change by citizens, consumers or businesses of any size.</span>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref12" name="footnote12" title="Go back to footnote reference 12 in the text">12</a>.  pp55-56, lines 15-1, Colin Myler, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-14-December-2011.pdf</p><!--footnote-->

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Newspapers and magazines are substantial recipients of public subsidies in some countries.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In France, for example, the press received &#8364;20m in subsidies in 2008,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup> with all forms of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aid to the press estimated at &#8364;1.2bn.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup> These subsidies take the form of direct payments</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for technological improvements, subsidised travel for reporters, reduced mailing rates for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers, tax advantages etc. Some subsidies are direct grants, others are repayable loans.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition a new scheme was started in 2010 to provide free newspapers to young people</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(one free copy a week; distribution is also paid for by the Government); this is an attempt to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">persuade the new generation to develop the habit of reading newspapers.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-15"><a href="#para3-15" name="para3-15">3.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sweden also provides direct subsidies to the press (around &#8364;61m in 2009),<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup> as do Denmark</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(around &#8364;44m in 2008)<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup> and Norway (around &#8364;35-40m in 2005)<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup> both directly and in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">form of tax exemptions.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-16"><a href="#para3-16" name="para3-16">3.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The tax system is one way of incentivising desired behaviour. In general, in recent decades UK</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Governments have taken the view that the corporate tax system should by used in this way</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only to address horizontal market failures, e.g. in relation to R&D. There are exceptions (the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">tax relief for film is one example) but these are not widespread and there is little appetite to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">increase them. The Inquiry has heard suggestions that the VAT exemption could be used as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mechanism to encourage compliance with a self-regulatory approach to standards, but there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are overwhelming legal problems with that idea.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-17"><a href="#para3-17" name="para3-17">3.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Also under the &#8216;encourage&#8217; heading is the wide range of more direct regulatory steps that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could be taken. These are addressed below.</span>
<h4>Transparency</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-18"><a href="#para3-18" name="para3-18">3.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Transparency is valuable in a situation where consumers or others need information to take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant decisions. This could work in two ways. It can take the form of transparency of action</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e.g. requiring all stories to run under the byline of a real person; requiring transparency on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the sources of quotes, requiring transparency on the method by which any story has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obtained). It can also take the form of transparency of compliance (e.g. requiring visible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">corrections, publishing accuracy league tables, publishing data on compliance with regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards).</span>

<p id="para-id-3-19"><a href="#para3-19" name="para3-19">3.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The advantage of transparency as a tool is that it enhances the effectiveness of the market by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reducing information asymmetry and putting consumers in the position of being able to take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a judgment on issues that they might otherwise not be aware of. Transparency should not in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">itself add significantly to regulatory cost, nor does it necessarily require any particular change</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the standards set, the point is simply to ensure that compliance, or the lack of it, is visible.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-20"><a href="#para3-20" name="para3-20">3.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, the difficulty of relying on self-regulation, where the harm or costs to be avoided</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fall to third parties who are not a part of the commercial transaction to be regulated, was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identified earlier. Transparency has some advantages in this respect by bringing those external</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">costs to the attention of consumers, but it does not actually address the situation where the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consumers have no direct interest in the external costs or harm.</span>

<a name="page1745"></a><!--new page--><h4>Complaint Resolution</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-21"><a href="#para3-21" name="para3-21">3.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Complaint Resolution allows for those, whether consumers or third parties, who consider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">themselves to have been harmed by an action to seek some form of restitution or redress.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are various models of complaint resolution. Most start with the complainant putting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their case to the company concerned. If the company fails to resolve the complaint to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">satisfaction of the complainant then the matter is classed as a dispute and there could be an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent body that would seek to resolve the dispute.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-22"><a href="#para3-22" name="para3-22">3.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">CurrentlythePCCactsasaquasiindependentdisputeresolution bodyinrespectofcomplaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about press conduct and content, but only where the publisher is a funding member of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PressBoF. There is no independent dispute resolution mechanism for those publications</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which chose not to be a part of the PCC.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-23"><a href="#para3-23" name="para3-23">3.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One widely used model for complaint resolution is the Ombudsman model. Ombudsmen can</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exist under statute or under voluntary agreement, and they will vary in how they operate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and their powers. The Financial Services Ombudsman is a statutory body which has powers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to resolve disputes between financial services companies and their customers in respect of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wide variety of products. The role of the ombudsman falls into two parts: first mediation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seek an agreed outcome and second, mediation having failed, determination of the dispute</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and imposition of a remedy. In the case of the FS Ombudsman the resolution is binding if the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consumer accepts it but they can choose to go to court if they wish to.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-24"><a href="#para3-24" name="para3-24">3.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">More generally Ombudsmen provide remedies which are fair and reasonable in all the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstances, and are not necessarily bound by a strict interpretation of the law or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">precedent. In the public sector and in some private schemes their recommendations are not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">binding but met with nearly total compliance. This is secured by a variety of means whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by law, by contract, by publicity, by a regulator or by the moral force and the standing of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Ombudsman. There is no appeal against Ombudsman decisions, other than Judicial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Review (where applicable) or where schemes (like the Pensions Ombudsman) have an appeal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">procedure in place.</span>
<h4>Incentives</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-25"><a href="#para3-25" name="para3-25">3.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Many types of incentives are available. The possibility of tax incentives has been considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">earlier but tax is a very blunt instrument for changing behaviour. Generally rewards can come</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in terms of specific benefits or preferential treatment although it is difficult to consider this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the abstract. A number of specific suggestions have been made to the Inquiry in respect of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the sorts of incentives that could be used, including: coverage in the ABC circulation figures;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advertisers boycotting publications outside the regulatory regime; enhanced weight being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given to public interest arguments in relation to unlawful behaviour; alternative dispute</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mechanisms to deal cheaply and quickly with libel and defamation cases (as well as other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards breaches) without going to court; and access to pre-publication, public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advice that could be relied upon in retrospect.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-26"><a href="#para3-26" name="para3-26">3.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Some of these would be purely self-regulatory and would rely on the goodwill of parties</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">outside the press (e.g. the advertising industry), some might require legislative change to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deliver and others might require the involvement of the courts (which means changes to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">law). All of the incentives that have been proposed to the Inquiry are considered fully in Part</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">K, Chapter 4.</span>
<a name="page1746"></a><!--new page--><h4>Penalties</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-27"><a href="#para3-27" name="para3-27">3.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Penalties for failure to comply can include dissuasive penalties to attempt to prevent non-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compliant behaviour occurring (or recurring) and remedial penalties to provide redress and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">make good the wrong, once the contravention has occurred. Generically, dissuasive penalties</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can include fines, removal of privileges/rights either as a punishment in its own right or to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">make it impossible for the perpetrator to repeat the offence (e.g. imprisonment, removal of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a licence), additional checks and constraints on behaviour and public disclosure. Remedial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">penalties can include payment of compensation, and other acts of restitution such as an</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">apology.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-28"><a href="#para3-28" name="para3-28">3.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the press context the Inquiry has heard suggestions for a range of potential penalties in both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the dissuasive and remedial categories: these include fines, a regime for requiring journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to hold a press card, temporary prevention of publication, and publication of corrections with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">equal prominence to the offending article.</span>
