<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<h2>THE PRESS AND THE POLICE: CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<h2>AND RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The subject-matter of Module Two of the Inquiry was the contacts and the relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between the press and the police, and the conduct of each. At the heart of this issue was the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">straightforward question (which is the same as will be discussed in respect of politicians): did</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the relationship become too close? In order to arrive at a fair and comprehensive picture, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry has examined many facets of that way in which press and police interact. It has done</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">so by looking at the overlapping issues of &#8216;tip offs&#8217;, &#8216;taking media on operations&#8217;, &#8216;off-the-</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">record&#8217; briefings, leaks, whistleblowing, gifts and hospitality, entertainment etc.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This list is lengthy but the issues underlying each of these areas have been similar. The words</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;integrity&#8217; and &#8216;perception&#8217; are common refrains. Putting the matter at its lowest, if a police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">officer tips off a member of the press, the perception may well be that he or she has done so</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in exchange for past favours or in the expectation of some future benefit. At its highest, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue becomes one of integrity for the police officer: his or her professional standing may be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">put under scrutiny. And the issue is exactly the same for off-the-record briefings and leaks</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(to cite just two of these foregoing examples), although separate points &#8211; in essence discrete</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matters of detail &#8211; arise in each individual case.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Integrity lies at the heart of policing by consent, and it is damaging enough if there is even</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the perception that a police officer may not be discharging his or her duty with complete</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transparency and disinterest. Ultimately, problems of perception lie at the heart of the public</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns regarding the police investigation into phone hacking up to January 2011 and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commencement of Operation Weeting. The full history has been examined at length above,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and my conclusions need not be restated here; but what is inescapable is that the harm to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the reputation of the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) in general and certain individual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police officers in particular has been immense. I have already referred to the fact that a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very damaging perception was created that the NoTW exercised an inappropriate degree of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">influence over the MPS, including a number of senior police officers and other employees.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Public confidence is in the process of being restored by the work of the MPS since January</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2011 and, I hope, the transparent process of this Inquiry.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I mention the MPS specifically in the context of the investigation into phone hacking, but I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">am able to go further. The problems in the relationship between the police and the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">covered by the evidence adduced during the course of Module Two of the Inquiry almost</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exclusively related to the MPS; save for isolated examples, typically arising when an event of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">national newsworthiness arose in the regions, the 43 police forces<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> outside the metropolis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enjoy sound relationships with the press, and the conduct of each gives rise to no concern.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I will touch on possible explanations for this later.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref1" name="footnote1" title="Go back to footnote reference 1 in the text">1</a>.  Part E Chapter 4</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref2" name="footnote2" title="Go back to footnote reference 2 in the text">2</a>.  I take the figure of 44 as the total number of police forces in England and Wales. I do not intend to exclude Scotlandand Northern Ireland from my general observations on this issue, although I recognise that the Inquiry received muchless evidence about them</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page980"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I will examine each of the issues I have identified above in turn, and set out my conclusions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and recommendations under separate headings, but at this stage I dwell on common or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generic matters. There are a number of interrelated considerations which need to be set out.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, the scale of the problem needs to be kept in proportion. The Inquiry has not unearthed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extensive evidence of police corruption (noting, as it has done, the current position in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Operation Elveden which is concerned with payments to public officials generally); nor is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there evidence satisfying the standard of proof I am applying to findings of fact in this Inquiry,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">namely the balance of probabilities, that significant numbers of police officers lack integrity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in one or more of the respects I have examined earlier.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> Speculation, suspicion and legitimate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perceptions may abound, and troubling evidence has been identified in a limited number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cases, but the notion that this may be a widespread problem as a matter of fact is not borne</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">out.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having made that important point, I recognise that breaches of professional standards of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the nature under consideration are extremely difficult to prove. Journalists protect their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">confidential sources, particularly if a briefing is off-the-record; tip offs may be suspected (in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some cases, going so far as to generate a reasonable inference) but clear-cut evidence is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">usually lacking. Further, the difficulties inherent in conducting an effective leak inquiry are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legion. These are all factors which I need to continue to bear in mind when examining the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue on a generic rather than a case-specific basis, and I do not overlook the fact that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Terms of Reference require me to approach my responsibilities, so far as is possible, at a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasonably high level of generality.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Another highly relevant consideration is the need to find the right balance between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationships that are overly close and those which are non-existent. The importance of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">free-flow of information (that is to say,<span style="font-style:italic"> appropriate</span> information) between the police and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press cannot be overstated. The press have an important role in holding the police to account,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and this entails building up relationships of trust with police officers thereby allowing the free</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exchange of information within relevant guidelines. Further, the whole concept of policing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by consent requires the engagement of the public, and very often this will be best achieved</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">through the mediation of the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are many respects in which off-the-record briefings operate against the public interest,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but in some, the public interest will be well served. By way of example, trusted journalists will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">benefit from a &#8216;background&#8217; briefing which enables reporting on specific topics to be placed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in their proper context; the press may be warned off pursuing certain lines of inquiry or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publishing a story on a particular occasion through concern that a police investigation may be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prejudiced. Further, albeit in a different context, although generally speaking drinking alcohol</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in a professional context amounts to poor judgment, and should not happen, there may well</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be occasions, admittedly relatively rare, on which it is unobjectionable. The point I am making</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is a short and simple one; I am addressing the need to find the right balance, the mid-course</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between policies and practices which are overly prescriptive one way or the other.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In many cases the straightforward application of common sense will be a sufficient guide:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset, Colin Port, referred to this as &#8216;the blush test&#8217;.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Yet, although that may work perfectly well for the vast majority of police officers working</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hard and conscientiously in the public interest, some may blush less readily than others.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, there remains a need for written policy guidance which is clear and directive,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and caters for the majority of situations. One issue which the Inquiry has focused on is the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">variability of such guidance across the Police Service as a whole. There is a need for greater</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref3" name="footnote3" title="Go back to footnote reference 3 in the text">3</a>.  Part G Chapter 3</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page981"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">consistency in certain instances, and for an overarching set of principles. I appreciate that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) and the Association of Chief Police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Officers (ACPO) are addressing this issue, but further work needs to be done.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-10"><a href="#para1-10" name="para1-10">1.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Another factor which I bear in mind, and this harks back to what I said about the MPS, is that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">senior police officers working in London are expected to have a public face: they speak for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the organisation as a whole in the public domain, often on issues of huge importance and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern, and in so doing will necessarily engage with the press. I do not overlook the fact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that Chief Constables will also need to form professional relationships with their regional</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">titles, but the pressures and expectations are not quite the same. Furthermore, there has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been an understandable tendency for senior police officers operating in London &#8211; those at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the rank of Assistant Commissioner and above &#8211; legitimately to regard themselves as akin</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to political figures in the sense that the nature of their work can regularly place them in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public eye. As I have already pointed out, a number of Commissioners of the MPS have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deliberately courted professional relationships with the press, amongst other reasons, in an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effort to enhance the standing of the service in the minds of the public. But the distinction</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between endeavouring to improve the standing of the Service on the one hand, and working</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the pursuit of self-interest on the other, may be a fine one.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-11"><a href="#para1-11" name="para1-11">1.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Police Service is also a hierarchical organisation with clear command structures and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">delineations of authority. This has at least two consequences. First and foremost, junior</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">officers will look up to their seniors for professional and ethical guidance; not necessarily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by expressly seeking advice, but rather for the example they might set. If a highly ranked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">officer is known to be wined and dined in expensive restaurants by representatives of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press, that has the potential to set the standard for those underneath him or her. Leading</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the front carries with it both its privileges and its responsibilities. Secondly, and even</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more problematically, the chain of command makes it difficult for junior officers to report</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their seniors for breaches of professional standards, and at the very least there will be a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perception that those in command of the Professional Standards Divisions (PSDs) of police</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">forces may naturally be disinclined to approach concerns drawn to their attention regarding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">officers of a higher rank, if only because of the natural assumption that senior officers know</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what they are doing and doubtless can fully justify what, in a more junior officer, might be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">open to challenge. All this is human nature, and to that extent completely understandable;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and pragmatic solutions need to be devised to address potentially intractable problems of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this nature.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-12"><a href="#para1-12" name="para1-12">1.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Another factor I bear in mind is the risk of over-reaction. Lord Condon, a former Commissioner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the MPS, spoke of twenty year cycles, being something akin to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> scandal,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> inquiry,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> remedial</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">action, relaxation, complacency, scandal, inquiry.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> What</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> did</span><span style="font-style:normal"> not</span><span style="font-style:normal"> state</span><span style="font-style:normal"> expressly</span><span style="font-style:normal"> is</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the &#8216;remedial action&#8217; has the potential of going too far in the direction of disengagement or,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">speaking more colloquially, battening down the hatches. Again, this is no more and no less</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than human nature, but one needs to identify the potential risk in order to guard against it.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-13"><a href="#para1-13" name="para1-13">1.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Before turning to examine the specific matters which were addressed above,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> I need to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">put all of this into perspective by drawing attention to one answer Neil Wallis gave when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressed by Counsel to the Inquiry about his relationship with Lord Stevens when the latter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was Commissioner of the MPS:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as he carried out the Stevens 3 Inquiries. He was the man who was the gangbuster in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Northumbria. He came down here. He bust corruption in the Met. So the suggestion is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that this man of integrity, of experience, of immense crime-fighting ability, is going to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be seduced by me taking him down to Cecconi&#8217;s and having steak and chips and a nice</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bottle of wine? I just can&#8217;t begin to see where this comes from. All I&#8217;m saying is: have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you ever had a working lunch? Have you ever had a working lunch with somebody</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more than once? Have you ever had a drink at that working lunch? You may well have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not. I guarantee everybody in this room just about has and it is the way of the world.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">That is all I&#8217;m saying. I&#8217;m not suggesting &#8211; I certainly won&#8217;t accept the idea that me</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">going for dinner with a police officer is any different from a civil servant going for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">dinner with a businessman. I see no difference in it at all. I might be wrong, but &#8211;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-14"><a href="#para1-14" name="para1-14">1.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For ease of reference and understanding, I will set out my conclusions, and then my</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations, in relation to the specific matters covered above.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> Often, I will draw on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">my earlier analysis, expanding it only where I need to place my conclusions into context. I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should record that I have had regard to the detailed and helpful closing submissions lodged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the Core Participants in relation to Module Two (as with the other modules): save in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">isolated instances, I do not refer to these expressly, but they have aided the development of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">my thinking on these matters.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. Tip offs</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By way of overview, the evidence that the Inquiry received on this issue could fairly be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described as &#8216;light&#8217; in relation to specific incidents (ie it would rarely discharge the standard</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of proof I am applying to findings of fact), but it is reasonably compelling at a higher level of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generality. Looking at the bigger picture, a critical mass of convergent evidence begins to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">persuasive. Furthermore, putting the jigsaw together, rather more general inferences may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be drawn; these cannot always be explained away by coincidence or invoking some other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explanation.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Tip offs are but one aspect of the wider problem of leaks. I have made the point, both in this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context and elsewhere, that the more robust the systems and processes in place to mitigate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the risks of leaks from within an organisation the better. I have also said<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> that it is sensible to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">go one stage further. It should be a matter of serious professional concern to the police that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information about their activities which should be kept confidential remains so. The presence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press at a high profile arrest may provide positive coverage although, unless very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">carefully handled, it may also give rise to difficult issues of fairness within the criminal justice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">process. Obviously, if for good reason, a decision has been taken to brief the press about a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">forthcoming arrest and to allow representative attendance, the risks (and the responsibilities</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the target of an arrest) should have been calibrated and taken into account. If there is no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such authority, however, and there is a legitimate inference that someone (whether police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">officer or civilian employee of the police) has leaked the information to the press generally or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a journalist specifically, I do not take the view that this is &#8216;just one of those things&#8217;. It should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not have happened.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref7" name="footnote7" title="Go back to footnote reference 7 in the text">7</a>.  Part G Chapter 3</p><!--footnote-->

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The professionalism required of police officers must be sufficiently robust to instil the mindset</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that such leaks about forthcoming arrests or the involvement of the famous in the criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justice system are not in the public interest, and that the provision of appropriate briefing as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to police activity should only be handled through open and transparent procedures which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have taken account of all relevant circumstances: they should not be by the back door.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I do not have any individual recommendations to make which are specific to the issue of tip</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offs, as opposed to the related issue of leaks. However, police forces should bear in mind</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what I have said about the importance of adherence to professional obligations and the need</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for these decisions to be made in a formal and transparent manner, not clandestinely still less</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involving self-interest.</span>

<a name="section3"></a>
<h2>3. Involvement of the press on operations</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Here, there are none of the evidential issues I have mentioned in the context of tip offs, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the sense that the fact of a press presence at an arrest or similar operation will be obvious.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nor do I have a sense that such problems that have existed in the past give rise to special</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern. Nonetheless, I do recognise that there are issues which could arise of privacy under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Article 8 and fair trial under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR),</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particularly in the sort of high-profile case which may be of the most interest to the press.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are also issues of perception and favouritism, although the evidence I have heard falls</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">short of suggesting anything close to an exchange of favours.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have already pointed out that there is existing ACPO Guidance<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> and formal MPS policy<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this issue. The question arises as to whether these documents are sufficient to assuage public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns in this respect. As I have made clear above,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup> I detected in much of the reflective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence I heard on this issue a sense that there needs to be a further tightening of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">current approach.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Overall I would endorse the general views of the Commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chief Constable Andrew Trotter, of the British Transport Police, on this issue. Police forces</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">must weigh very carefully the public interest considerations of taking the media on police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operations against the rights of the individuals who are the subject of such an operation.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Forces must also have directly in mind a consideration of any potential and consequential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impact on the victims in such cases. More generally, I think that the current guidance in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this area needs to be strengthened. For example, I think that it should be made abundantly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear that save in exceptional and clearly identified circumstances (for example, where there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may be an immediate risk to the public), the names or identifying details of those who are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the press or the public: these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">details are not routinely announced by way of press release; that the press were present at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the arrest should make no difference.</span>

<h2>4. Off-the-record briefings</h2>

<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It has already been noted that this terminology generates a degree of confusion, which in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">itself has the capability to undermine adherence to professional standards. Given the room</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for debate about the meaning of this term and others describing the status to be accorded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to information supplied by police officers, it is unsurprising that the current &#8216;Interim ACPO</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Guidance for Relationships with the Media&#8217; seeks to define the widely deployed terminology</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expressly:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;On the record &#8211; means that a journalist can report, quote and name their source.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Where possible, all conversations should be on this basis and it should always be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">assumed that a conversation is on the record unless expressly agreed otherwise in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">advance.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Background/guidance &#8211; means that information provided can be reported without</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it being attributed to a source, whether named or not. This is sometimes used to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">provide further context around an on the record statement.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Off-the-record &#8211; means that use of information provided is restricted altogether.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Occasionally there may be a legitimate reason for an off-the-record conversation or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">briefing to take place, such as where news reporting may have an impact on a current</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation or as a means of preventing inaccuracies or misunderstanding.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have already recognised that the use of off-the-record briefings, properly understood, may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be a valuable resource in the context of an established, trusting relationship between a police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">officer and a journalist. Without seeking to revisit the terminological debate, background/</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">guidance briefings are also capable of working in the public interest, as opposed to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private interests of the police officer or the journalist. On the other hand, risks clearly exist</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and these are of a similar nature to those already highlighted in Sections 2 and 3 above: the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potential for confidential information to be disseminated and then published; the perception</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that inappropriate relationships will be created and favours exchanged.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have already pointed out that Elizabeth Filkin in her report into the ethics of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and police relationship, agreed that there was value for the Police Service in the limited and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsible use of &#8216;off-the-record&#8217; communications. She was specific about this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;I have no doubt that the police will have to occasionally do off-the-record briefing,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">because otherwise they would jeopardise an investigation, and a reporter may have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">got a bit of a story which, if they ran it, would be very harmful, and the only way to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">prevent that being run, in a sensible fashion, would be to give them an off-the-record</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">briefing and to tell them that you would inform them as soon as you could when it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was possible to let that get out onto the public airwaves.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I certainly agree that, in the circumstances outlined above, and for example in the context</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of counter-terrorism operations or other sensitive police investigations, some form of non-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reportable or confidential briefing mechanism should continue to be available as a limited</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">tool for the Police Service in their interaction with the media. I am not sure that any more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specific guidance from me in this area is necessary or would be helpful.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref12" name="footnote12" title="Go back to footnote reference 12 in the text">12</a>.  Interim ACPO Guidance for Relationships with the Media, para 3.5, http://www.acpo.police.uk/documents/reports/2012/201204IntGuiMediaRels.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref13" name="footnote13" title="Go back to footnote reference 13 in the text">13</a>.  p30, lines 2-11, Elizabeth Filkin, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-5-March-2012.pdf</p><!--footnote-->

<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, I would make the following observations. Given the confusion that clearly exists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between journalists and police officers and police staff alike in relation to the term off-the-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">record, I believe that serious consideration should be given to its removal from the lexicon of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police and media contact. Aside from the confusion in actual meaning, a negative connotation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has also developed which implies that any exchange of information through &#8216;off-the-record&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contact is being done on a surreptitious basis. In my view, greater clarity of thought and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consistency of application would be achieved if two descriptors were used. What is critical is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there should be no doubt about the status of all that passes from the officer to the press.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that the term &#8216;off-the-record&#8217; briefing should be discontinued. The </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">term  &#8216;non-reportable  briefing&#8217;  should  be  used  to  cover  a  background  briefing </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">which is not to be reported, and the term &#8216;embargoed briefing&#8217; should be used to </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">cover a situation where the content of the briefing may be reported but not until </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">a specified event or time.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup> In my judgment, these terms more neutrally describe </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">what are legitimate police and media interactions. </span>

<p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In their written submissions at the conclusion of Module Two, the MPS set out its position as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;The current thinking of the MPS is that there should be a requirement that a record</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be made of every contact between an MPS officer and a journalist. The purpose of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that requirement would be to make it possible to ascertain, if the need ever arises,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the nature and frequency of the contact, the level of contact and reason for contact.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">This, it is anticipated, would serve both as an incentive for personal discipline and a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">means for discovering and discouraging the unauthorised release of information.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The guiding principle for the future regulation of contact with the media should be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">one of openness, allowing the Police Service to engage constructively with the media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whilst ensuring that it can be held to account for its relationship with its media&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-7"><a href="#para4-7" name="para4-7">4.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I welcome and endorse almost the whole of this contribution, save for the qualification that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I would distinguish between a requirement and good practice in relation to the recording of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contact between junior officers and journalists. I would also endorse the comments both of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Roger Baker,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup> Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspector of Constabulary, and Mrs Filkin in relation to the need</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for transparency in this area. If the police are simply seeking to correct an inaccuracy within a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story, for example, then I can see no legitimate reason why that contact should not normally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be considered to be &#8216;on-the-record&#8217; (there may be rare occasions when the correction needs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be &#8216;off-the-record&#8217; to avoid identifying an individual suspect).</span>

<p id="para-id-4-8"><a href="#para4-8" name="para4-8">4.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">More generally, although I would also encourage junior officers and staff to do the same</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(principally for their own protection),</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref14" name="footnote14" title="Go back to footnote reference 14 in the text">14</a>.  Briefings may be a combination of the two: for example, part embargoed (i.e. reportable later) and part non-reportable (ie background only, and never to be reported). Equally, a briefing may be in part on the record and, in part,embargoed or non-reportable.</p><!--footnote-->

<a name="page986"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that it should be mandatory for ACPO rank officers to record all of </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">their  contact  with  the  media,  and  for  that  record  to  be  available  publically for </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">transparency and audit purposes. This record need be no more than a very brief </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">note to the effect that a conversation has taken place and the subject matter of </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">that conversation. Where the discussion involves a more significant operational </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">or organisational matter, then it may be sensible for a more detailed note to be </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">retained. Finally, in circumstances where policy or organisation matters may be on </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">the agenda for discussion, it is good practice for a press officer also to be present. </span>

<p id="para-id-4-9"><a href="#para4-9" name="para4-9">4.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Given the important role that the press play in assuring police legitimacy and in protecting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public interest I certainly do not want to discourage contact between the police (at all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">levels) and the media. It also remains important that the appropriate degree of contact is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">maintained between the press and junior officers. Subject to what I have already said, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">latter should be trusted to use their judgment to do what is right and not to do what is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wrong, and be accountable for the consequences. However, where there is an incident of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unauthorised disclosure, the lack of any record may in itself be a determining factor when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assessing the propriety of what has happened in the context of an internal police leak</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation (assuming that there is other probative evidence which links the police officer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the leak).</span>

<p id="para-id-4-10"><a href="#para4-10" name="para4-10">4.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, and most importantly in my view, police officers at all levels must only communicate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the media within their own area of competence. I would entirely endorse and, thus,</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend as good practice the simple rule included within the &#8216;Interim ACPO </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">Guidance for Relationships with the Media&#8217; which is:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Police officers and staff should ask: &#8216;am I the person responsible for</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">communicating about this issue and is there a policing purpose for doing so?&#8217; If</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the answer to both parts of this question is &#8216;yes&#8217;, they should go ahead.&#8221;</span>

<h2>5. Leaks of information</h2>

<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This issue shares many themes in common with the previous topics &#8211; in particular, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disclosure of unauthorised, if not confidential, information to the press &#8211; but there is often an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">added dimension, namely a less than selfless motive. Leaks may take place because a police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">officer genuinely believes that this may be the best way of placing misconduct or impropriety</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into the public domain, but sometimes the motive is little other than personal disgruntlement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or the desire to wound colleagues. Putting to one side the instances where such motives are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in play, the issue of leaks clearly overlaps with the issue of whistleblowing which I address in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Section 8 below, but at this stage I am looking at the matter more broadly.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I fully accept and understand that the issue is much more nuanced than the foregoing short</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">summary conveys, and I invite attention to my detailed examination of this topic above.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-3"><a href="#para5-3" name="para5-3">5.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As with &#8216;tip-offs&#8217;, there are serious evidential issues. Leaks are notoriously difficult to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigate, and often a suspected leak turns out to be something different: the press may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have obtained relevant information from some other source, or may simply have indulged</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to record all of their contact with the media, and good practice for junior officers and staff</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(for their own protection). I entirely accept that this in itself will not prevent a determined</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual from leaking. However, as Commissioner Hogan-Howe pointed out,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup> a record of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that individual&#8217;s account would be a starting place for an investigation.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-5"><a href="#para5-5" name="para5-5">5.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A degree of lack of transparency in this area is inevitable given the often understandable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">desire of the media to protect the identity of their sources. Given the reputational damage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that can be caused, I can also readily understand the frustration of the Police Service in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstances where a &#8216;police source&#8217; is quoted but it then transpires that the information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">came from an outside individual. There is a balance here and, although I recognise the critical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">importance of protecting sources, I would certainly encourage the press to be as transparent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as possible when using the term &#8216;source&#8217;, so that, where possible, the general provenance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the information is more easily understood: furthermore, to assert that there is a source when,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in truth, there is not, both potentially damages the police and is, in any event, misleading on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the part of the journalist.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-6"><a href="#para5-6" name="para5-6">5.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I turn to address the related issue of misuse of the Police National Computer (PNC). This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was of particular concern to the Core Participant Victims and I am grateful for their written</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">submissions on this topic. Overall, notwithstanding the problems that there have been, I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">am satisfied that the MPS and the wider Police Service now treat this issue with sufficient</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seriousness. However, it is equally clear that there can be no room for complacency in this</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">area given that misuse of the PNC continues to be a problem for the service as a whole. With</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this in mind,</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that the Police Service should re-examine the rigour of the auditing </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">process and the frequency of the conduct of audits in relation to access to the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">Police  National  Computer  (PNC).  Additional  consideration  should  also  be  given </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">to the number of people given access to the PNC and the associated rules which </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">govern its usage.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Apart from the evidence bearing directly on the relationship between the MPS and NI,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which it is not necessary to recapitulate at this stage, the Inquiry heard of a wide range of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approaches and house styles. Much of the variability is no doubt attributable to differing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personalities and temperaments, but as Mrs Filkin has concluded more generally,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;[t]here</span><span style="font-style:italic"> has</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been wide variation in how the senior team interpreted policy on dealing with the media and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">receiving gifts and hospitality. In some instances this interpretation is seen as inappropriate.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There has been no clear standard set by the senior team for police officers and staff to use as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a guide for their own behaviour and in some instances the standards set have been poor and</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The recent ACPO Guidance<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup> sets out the circumstances in which hospitality may, or may not,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be accepted. I have set this out in full elsewhere.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-4"><a href="#para6-4" name="para6-4">6.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have made it clear that I would certainly endorse the key principles contained within this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">guidance. Without wanting to be overly prescriptive or puritanical on this issue, in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstances</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that the recent ACPO Guidance should more specifically spell out the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">dangers of consuming alcohol in a setting of casual hospitality (without necessarily </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">specifying a blanket ban).</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It also strikes me that the concept of an<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;</span> industry norm&#8221; in this context may still allow for a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">variance in practice from force to force, and may tend to assume what needs to be established.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, I would certainly adopt in full the guidance provided to police officers (at all levels)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and police staff in helping them to determine the boundaries of what is acceptable:</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Is it genuine? Is the offer made for reasons of genuine appreciation for something</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I have done? Why is the offer being made? What are the circumstances? Have I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">solicited this offer in any way or does the donor feel obliged to make this offer?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Is it independent? Would the offer or acceptance be seen as reasonable in the eyes of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the public? Would a reasonable bystander be confident I could remain impartial and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">independent in all of the circumstances?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Is it free? Will I feel obliged to do something in return? How do I feel about the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">propriety of the offer? What are the donor&#8217;s expectations of me should I accept?</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is also vital that transactional change in the form of new policies and guidance is aligned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with real cultural change. As the evidence has made clear, leadership can be the key</span>

<h2>7. Media employment</h2>

<p id="para-id-7-1"><a href="#para7-1" name="para7-1">7.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have examined this topic from two opposing perspectives: first, from the viewpoint of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists being recruited to work for the police service; and second, the other way round.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Unsurprisingly, the second issue is far more sensitive and problematic than the first.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-2"><a href="#para7-2" name="para7-2">7.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In brief, I do not believe that there should be any restriction on journalists being recruited</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to work for the Police Service, save that the process should be conducted in line with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">procedures of the Government Communication Network (GCN) in an open and transparent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">manner. It may in fact be good practice, for the purposes of transparency, for individual forces</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to publish details ofthemake-up of their PRor communications departments in genericterms,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but I consider that to be a matter for them. There is clearly a need for media expertise and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Police Service should be free to choose the best person for the job in a competitive free</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">market. That is not to say &#8211; as a freestanding observation - that forces should not examine</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their existing media relations training and awareness with a view to increasing skill levels, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to which Surrey Police have derived much benefit.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-3"><a href="#para7-3" name="para7-3">7.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The issue of police officers leaving to work for the media is, I have already said, more difficult.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That issue may be sub-divided into two segments. Taking first the position of junior officers,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have concluded that it would be wrong to place restrictions, for example in the form of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;cooling off&#8217; period, on police officers and staff below ACPO rank leaving the Police Service,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perhaps to return to a career in the media. In practice, the evidence suggests that journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">leaving the police service for an employed job rarely return to journalism. In addition, any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">restrictions would clearly have to be balanced against the right of any individual to seek</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">employment as and where he or she wishes. In these circumstances, I believe that it would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be contrary to the public interest to impose any restrictions of the type described.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-4"><a href="#para7-4" name="para7-4">7.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The position is different as regards senior officers of ACPO rank. The Inquiry received a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considerable body of evidence which reflected public concern of very senior officers taking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media jobs (usually on retirement), or writing articles for the press; I do not touch the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question of books or memoires. This issue is intertwined in the public mind with the broader</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perceptual questions surrounding the relationship between senior officers of the MPS and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NI, a topic which I have covered fully elsewhere.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-5"><a href="#para7-5" name="para7-5">7.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whilst mindful of the concerns expressed by a number of witnesses, including Sir Paul</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Stephenson, the former Commissioner of the MPS, and Chief Constable Stephen House, of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Strathclyde Police, in particular, on balance I have come to the conclusion that consideration</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be given to the terms on which ACPO rank officers are engaged and, in particular to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether these terms should be amended to prevent employment by media organisations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in much the same way as the previous Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) contracts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prevented employment by those with a contractual relationship with the MPS. I appreciate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that regard must be had to issues of restraint of trade, to the right to seek employment,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to freedom of expression, and, additionally, to the public interest in receiving information.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">But there are counterbalancing public interests that are also important. With this in mind, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seems to me that a time bar of twelve months would be sufficient to provide an appropriate</span>

<p id="para-id-7-6"><a href="#para7-6" name="para7-6">7.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am not in a position to consider all the ramifications of such a proposal; my recommendation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is, therefore, limited. In the circumstances,</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that consideration should be given to the terms upon which ACPO </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">rank officers are appointed and, in particular, whether these terms should include </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">some limitation upon the nature of any employment within or by the media that </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">can be undertaken without the approval of the relevant authority for a period of 12 </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">months following the cessation of the appointment.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I understand that should this recommendation be accepted then it may also require a change</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the regulations governing the Police Service.</span>

<h2>8. Corruption, whistleblowing and related matters</h2>

<p id="para-id-8-1"><a href="#para8-1" name="para8-1">8.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I appreciate that the topics of whistleblowing and corruption raise issues which are common</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to neither, but for the purposes of this Inquiry there is much common ground. It is for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that reason that I take them together. Doing so also makes it easier to follow the series of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations which I set out below.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-2"><a href="#para8-2" name="para8-2">8.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I take corruption first. The Inquiry has not been the place to examine the broader issue of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">corruption within the Police Service; the focus has rightly been on corruption in the specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context of media relations. Additionally, the current position in relation to Operation Elveden</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has inevitably hampered the ability of the Inquiry to delve into the issue in any depth.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nonetheless, I bear in mind the frank evidence I have heard from senior police officers which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hasgivenmeaclearsenseoftheseriousnessandscaleoftheproblem.Nooneunderestimates</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the gravity of the issue as a matter of generality, but it would be wrong for anyone to believe</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">that corruption is endemic in the Police Service.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-3"><a href="#para8-3" name="para8-3">8.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As I have already pointed out, training and guidance are obviously important preventive tools</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in seeking to address this issue. The relevant overarching guidance in this area is provided,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">first, through the ACPO Counter Corruption Advisory Group (ACCAG), whose &#8216;Guidance for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Investigation of Corruption&#8217; was first published in 2003 and last formally revised in 2006;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this guidance has been adopted by all chief officers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup> Second, the recognised &#8216;Standards of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Professional Behaviour&#8217; are set out in the Schedule to the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2008</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the related Home Office guidance (026/2008) on police unsatisfactory performance and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">misconduct procedures, and Standards of Professional Behaviour for Police staff, as agreed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the Police Staff Council. This guidance has also been adopted by all police forces, including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the MPS.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup> Both sets of guidance are currently under review and are dealt with in more detail</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Evidenced bytheguidance and training currentlyin place,and thevigourwith which individual</span>

<a name="page991"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">Police Service takes this issue seriously. There are, however, gaps and weaknesses in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">collective approach to the issue a number of which have been identified by HMIC. Having said</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, I am in no doubt that the Police Service is genuine in its desire to tackle corruption head</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on, with the ACPO led response to the HMIC report being particularly important in this regard.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For my part, I would whole heartedly adopt the HMIC recommendations relating to the need</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for consistent national standards and guidance, enhanced training and awareness, and more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">robust corporate governance arrangements. From the stand-point of sanctions, corruption is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a criminal offence with serious penalties, I do not feel it necessary therefore, to recommend</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any additional statutory or regulatory tools to assist in dealing with this important issue.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think the key findings that come out of this in many ways chime in with those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">previous work that&#8217;s been done, particularly by the HMIC, about the need for greater</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">clarity both for the public in terms of what&#8217;s police corruption and therefore what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is appropriate to bring to the IPCC, but also greater clarity in terms of &#8211; perhaps</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">greater consistency in recording incidents that have taken place from force to force.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">They identify that different forces appear to have&#8230;different levels of reporting of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">complaints about corruption and the question is raised as to whether that&#8217;s because</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of a different definition being used rather than the behaviour in relation to the forces.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Crucially, it refers again to the issue of additional powers and also about resources,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and these are issues that we intend, when legislative time allows, to be able to make</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">changes to the powers to the IPCC and we are looking at the case that they&#8217;ve put</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">forward in relation to additional resources.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-6"><a href="#para8-6" name="para8-6">8.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I certainly support these proposed changes and share the view of the IPCC that, in order for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the system to work as it should, it is vital that all police forces are both alert to allegations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of corruption and are capable of dealing with them effectively and appropriately.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup> I also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">agree that this is an area where independent oversight is essential, particularly from the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">standpoint of public perception, not least because the confidence of the public in the police is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fundamental to its legitimacy and to the absolutely critical cooperation and compliance that,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as an organisation, it needs both to expect and also to achieve.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-7"><a href="#para8-7" name="para8-7">8.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The issue of corruption overlaps with that of whistleblowing for the obvious reason that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">latter is often the route to the former being exposed. I recognise that there are other routes,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including of course robust investigative journalism (undeniably in the public interest) as well</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as the persistent endeavours of leaders within the Police Service, but for present purposes I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">am focusing on disclosures from within the organisation.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-8"><a href="#para8-8" name="para8-8">8.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I recognise and understand the sensitivity of this issue, and the sentiment expressed by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">many that the press is a safety valve for genuine grievances and concerns within the Police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Service as a whole. However, there remains an important point of principle which I need to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">come back to: that information which is confidential should remain so, unless there really are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exceptional circumstances justifying the placing of that information into the public domain.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Additionally, and looking at this more widely, the ends do not usually or, at least necessarily,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justify the means.</span>

IPCC Report &#8211; &#8216;Corruption in the police service in England and Wales: Second report &#8211; a report based on the IPCC&#8217;sexperience from 2008 to 2011, May 2012, p5, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IPCC-Corruption-in-the-Police-2nd-Report.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page992"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-8-9"><a href="#para8-9" name="para8-9">8.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">My overall assessment is that a series of pragmatic solutions need to be devised to maximise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the chance that genuine whistle-blowers will use confidential avenues in which they may have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">faith, rather than feel it necessary to break confidences by bringing about much wider public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dissemination through disclosures to the media. In my view, this strikes the right balance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between the competing interests at stake.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-10"><a href="#para8-10" name="para8-10">8.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As I have already said, the starting point for any police officer or member of police staff wishing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to report an issue of concern should be that they first look to their internal procedures, which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are buttressed by the law governing protected disclosures. I appreciate that all police forces</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">already have a whistleblowing line of reporting direct to the PSD of that force: typically, this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will be headed by a detective chief superintendent &#8211; in other words, a senior officer capable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of holding the respect of the majority of police ranks. Nonetheless, I also recognise that Mrs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Filkin identified a general lack of confidence in the ability of these departments to address</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their concerns across the board. There may also be some legitimate concern as to the ability (if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not the overall willingness) of PSDs challenging the most senior on issues concerning integrity</span>

<p id="para-id-8-11"><a href="#para8-11" name="para8-11">8.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Apart from the PSDs, the present position is that the Independent Police Complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commission (IPCC) already has a Public Interest Disclosure Act telephone line which is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">available for use in these circumstances, but it does not enjoy a sufficiently high profile. As</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and when whistle blowers use it, I understand that the IPCC&#8217;s practice, if at all possible, is to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conduct an interview, in order better to inform its assessment of the merits of the concern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being expressed.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-12"><a href="#para8-12" name="para8-12">8.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Given the apparent lack of trust in the current process, a more independently operated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system should be considered. I strongly believe that a more developed structure is required to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ensure that the public have absolute confidence that issues of integrity will be appropriately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">addressed at all levels within the Police Service, and that whistle blowers also have the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">confidence that their grievances will be addressed.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-13"><a href="#para8-13" name="para8-13">8.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As I explain below, I have in mind an enhanced role for both the IPCC and HMIC. For a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of reasons I am not in a position to descend into the detail of the structure I have in mind not</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">least because of the changing landscape surrounding police policy and its implementation. I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">am simply not in a position to forecast precisely how the responsibilities of the newly elected</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) will fit into the overall picture alongside the work</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the newly created National Crime Agency, ACPO (howsoever designated) or the National</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Police Improvement Agency (to be superseded by the College of Policing). Neither is it clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to me how the work of the HMIC will be affected, or what (if any) impact there will be on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">IPCC. All that I can do is to describe the architecture, and others will need to take it forward by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inserting the building-blocks as relationships and responsibilities are established. I recognise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that each of the bodies I have mentioned will wish to contribute to that debate and a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have not given evidence to the Inquiry.</span>
<a name="page993"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-8-14"><a href="#para8-14" name="para8-14">8.14</a></p>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">In the circumstances, I recommend that an enhanced system for protection of whistle </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">blowers and for providing assistance for the Police Service on general ethical issues </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">should at least comprise the following:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(a)  greater prominence should be given to the IPCC&#8217;s PIDA telephone line;</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(b)  there should be an &#8216;ethics line&#8217; to the IPCC, available for all serving Police Officers, </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">providing general ethical guidance;</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(c)  to  avail  those  at  Chief  Officer  level  (Assistant  Commissioner  level  within  the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">MPS), HMIC should identify one of its members, a former Chief Constable, as the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">designated point of contact for confidential ethics guidance. The Chief Officer </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">seeking and obtaining that advice would be able to refer to it should any issue </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">subsequently arise on a complaint to a PSD, a PCC, or indeed the IPCC itself. The </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">advice would not be determinative of the complaint, but the fact that it was </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">sought and received, as well as its content, would be a matter to be taken into </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 16px;">account;</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(d)  within the IPCC itself, there is a need for an enhanced &#8216;filter system&#8217; whereby </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">the nature of complaints are appropriately addressed at an early stage so that </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(a) they can be investigated at the right level, and (b) sufficient structures are put </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">in place to maintain confidentiality of the complaint, and differentiate as soon </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">as is appropriate between genuine whistle blowers and those who are merely </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">ventilating a personal grievance;</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(e)  the former Chief Constable referred to under sub-paragraph (c) above should </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">also be the recipient of complaints about Chief Constables made to the IPCC. In </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">the event that he or she may already have given informal advice in relation to </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">the subject-matter of the complaint, as per sub-paragraph (c) above, a substitute </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">HMI would be deputed to act; and</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(f)  Chief  Officers  should  also  be  the  subject  of  regular  independent  scrutiny  by </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">HMIC, including through unannounced inspections.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-15"><a href="#para8-15" name="para8-15">8.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As I have said, and for the reasons I have given, I am not addressing the actual mechanics of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such a system in this Report. But allied to this, I would also consider it prudent for PCCs and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chief Officers quickly to reassess the corporate governance arrangements in place within</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">each force area to ensure that they are fit for purpose. This would obviously be an important</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">part of ensuring that each of their specific roles and responsibilities in this area are clearly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">delineated.</span>

<a name="section9"></a>
<h2>9. Conclusion</h2>

<p id="para-id-9-1"><a href="#para9-1" name="para9-1">9.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is clear that the Police Service as a whole has responded positively and proactively in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wake of the public concerns which led to the setting up of this Inquiry in July 2011. I welcome</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the thoroughness and good sense of the changes which have been recommended to date,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the spirit in which the Police Service has demonstrated willingness for implementing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate and judicious enhancements of the existing regimes. Ultimately, the Police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Service in general and the MPS in particular has understood the importance of such a positive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">response in terms of allaying public concerns and correction legitimate perceptions.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-2"><a href="#para9-2" name="para9-2">9.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In taking its existing work forward, as supplemented by the recommendations I have made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in this Chapter, I fully endorse the judicious contribution made by the Home Secretary to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry and, in particular, her emphasis on the need for a country-wide series of policies</span>
<a name="page994"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">coordinated through or by ACPO. The majority of the issues at stake here are of universal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">application. The &#8216;blush test&#8217; will continue to work as a sound guide for the vast majority but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear leadership and the setting of the tone from the top is vital. Finally, clear and direct policy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">guidance is necessary to reinforce these common sense messages.</span>
