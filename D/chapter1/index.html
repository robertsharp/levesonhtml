<h1>CHAPTER 1<br/>THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In order to understand the present position in relation to press regulation, it is necessary to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examine what has happened in the past. This chapter of the Report examines the content and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context of the three Royal Commissions into the British Press undertaken since the Second</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">World War, the Younger Report into Privacy of 1972, and the two reports of Sir David Calcutt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">QC into privacy and the press published in 1990 and 1993. Taken together, these form the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">formal public policy response to concerns with the press, press standards and the behaviour</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of journalists and others acting on behalf of newspapers and their employees, in the post-war</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">period.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It can be argued that the findings of the three Royal Commissions as well as the reports</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Sir David Calcutt not only help to elucidate a pattern of press behaviour that remains</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pertinent to the work of this Inquiry, but also set out a series of attempts to find a solution to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">problems that remain broadly unchanged and unaddressed. Indeed, it has been contended</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by some witnesses to the Inquiry that the six documents that form the backdrop to this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">chapter bear telling testament to a misplaced faith in the ability of the industry to develop</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and lead self-regulatory systems capable of offering appropriate real redress to those who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been wronged, and of constituting a sufficient solution to problems of unethical and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unlawful behaviour in the newspaper industry. In this regard, the Media Standards Trust has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said in its submission to the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The conclusion&#8230; that self-regulation on its own, without any greater independence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or enhanced powers, does not provide adequate protection for the public or for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalists - is based in large part on an historical analysis of the continued failure</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the various voluntary self-regulatory bodies that have existed since the first Royal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Commission on the Press published its report in 1949.&#8221;</span>

<h3>Some context</h3>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As has been emphasised in this Report on more than one occasion, the British press has a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">long held reputation for the vitality and quality of its journalism as well as the diversity of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voices with which it speaks. Certainly, it has been with something approaching envy that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">overseas commentators examining the British press both historically and today have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impressed by both its freedoms and the breadth and scope of its journalism. In this regard, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is worth highlighting the very large number of occasions that the Inquiry has been told with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">real pride by commentators, journalists, proprietors and politicians about the achievements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the British press and the valuable role it plays in the public life of the nation.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For my part, I do not doubt that, at its best, British journalism is and has historically been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">world-beating: it has uncovered scandal, reported on significant events, and campaigned on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues of importance with both decency and integrity. Furthermore, it has been made very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear during the course of this Inquiry that journalism of the highest quality is not restricted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only to a certain section of the press but is to be found across its many distinct and different</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref1" name="footnote1" title="Go back to footnote reference 1 in the text">1</a>.  p13, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Submission-by-Media-Standards-Trust.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">parts: not only in the broadsheets but also in the mid-market titles and the tabloids along</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the regional and local press, both in print and now also in their online editions.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Before dealing with the analysis of historical responses to the culture and practices of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press, it is worth restating that the press does not exist in a vacuum. It is subject to other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">forces. Technological and societal changes have increased the pressures on what is and has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">historically been an intensely competitive market. The share which the newspaper industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">holds of the wider communications market has been steadily eroded, first by radio and then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the advent and growth of television. Television has moved from one initial offering by the BBC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the explosion of channels available through the introduction of satellite television services</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, further, with the continuation of this trend through the rollout of digital television.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The loss of market share has been further exacerbated by the internet and the increasing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">availability of mixed media services through that medium. Overall, these forces have had an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important role in shaping the culture, practices and ethics of the press over decades.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Itshouldnotbethoughtthatthecultureandpracticesthathavegivenrisetotheestablishment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of this Inquiry are in any way new, even if much of the technology which underpins new</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">developmentsis.Concernsastothebehaviourandpracticesofthepresshavebeenarticulated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by both private individuals and Governments throughout the twentieth century, and (in one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">form or another) very much earlier. Indeed, some of the practices and concerns that gave</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rise to the 1947 Royal Commission into the Press, and in particular those in relation to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breach of privacy of individuals, have been effectively repeated before this Inquiry. Thus, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">historical review carried out in this chapter demonstrates a number of common themes; in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular, it reveals not merely consistent and similar complaints over the preceding decades,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but also consistent and similar proposed solutions.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. The royal Commission into the press 1947</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Shortly after the election of the Labour Government in May 1945, the National Union of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Journalists (NUJ) passed a resolution which called for the new administration to establish</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an independent Commission to examine, among other things, structures of ownership and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">control of British newspapers. The NUJ resolution reflected growing concern about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">influence of a small group of newspaper publishers who had substantively increased their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">share of the national newspaper market in the inter-war period. The NUJ resolution also gave</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voice to other concerns and called for a Commission to investigate:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...with the object of furthering the free expression of opinion through the Press and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the greatest practicable accuracy in the presentation of news, to inquire into the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">control, management and ownership of the newspaper and periodical Press and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">news agencies, including the financial structure and the monopolistic tendencies in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">control, and to make recommendations thereon.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The resolution led to the tabling of a motion in the House of Commons that repeated its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">central concerns. Advanced by members of Parliament who had either worked as journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or were still employed as such, the motion also made an explicit connection between the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">growing concentration in newspaper ownership by a small number of proprietors as well</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as the substantial increases in the profitability of some newspapers since the conclusion</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">of hostilities, and a supposed decline in the quality of British journalism.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> The motion was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">passed by MPs on the 29 October 1946. It read:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;That, having regard to the increasing public concern at the growth of monopolistic</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">tendencies in the control of the Press and with the object of furthering the free</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expression of opinion through the Press and the greatest practicable accuracy in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the presentation of news this House considers that a Royal Commission should be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">appointed to inquire into the finance, control, management and ownership of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">Press.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In part, the concerns articulated in the resolution of the NUJ and the Parliamentary motion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reflected understandable public disquiet at a return to business as usual by the newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry after the war years (which had entailed strict Government control of all content,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">print as well as the means of distribution). The reversion to a peacetime modus operandi</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also heralded the return, after the quiescence of the war years, of a number of sharper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalistic practices increasingly unpalatable to the public at large. These were manifest to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">differing degrees in accusations of inaccuracy and political bias on the one hand and alarm at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the intrusion of journalists into the private lives of individuals on the other.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, public indignation at such behaviour was not new; the culture and practices of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some parts of the press had been noted as a matter of concern by the immediate pre-war</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government-appointed Political and Economic Planning (PEP) group which, in 1938, had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">formulated the first significant proposal for formal self-regulation of the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> Among</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other things, the PEP group&#8217;s final report argued for the establishment of a voluntary Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Tribunal led by an independent Chairman and supported by a panel of experts drawn from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the newspaper industry. This, the report suggested, should consider and mediate complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made by members of the public about the press. The outbreak of war drew an end to any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further work to achieve this end.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Commission was granted a broad remit by the Government of Clement Atlee and was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">charged with seeking answers to a number of questions that went further than the concerns</span>
that have been outlined above. The Government asked that the Commission investigate: <sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a>, <a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When the Royal Commission reported in 1949, it made a number of damning findings. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">found that there had been<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> progressive</span><span style="font-style:italic"> decline</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> calibre</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> editors</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> quality</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press itself, but also the welfare of the country at large. The Commission recommended</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that a system of self-regulation should be established, built around a &#8220;General Council of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press&#8221;. The Commission was unambiguous in its consideration of statutory controls which, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argued, would unacceptably restrict the freedoms of the press. It said that it was necessary:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;to safeguard the freedom of the press; to encourage the growth of a sense of public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">responsibility and public service amongst all engaged in the profession of journalism</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">[...]; and to further the efficiency of the profession and the well being of those who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">practiced it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Royal Commission hoped that the proposed General Press Council would function both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a guarantor of the &#8220;freedom and prestige of the Press&#8221;, by representing the interests of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper industry through a single, unified voice as well as a brake on poor and unethical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalistic practices. In so doing the Royal Commission made a fundamental statement on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the nature of the relationship between the state of the press and the health of the nation as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whole, suggesting a correlation between the ownership structures of the newspaper industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the incidence of inaccurate reporting and poor journalism. Significantly too, the Royal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commission&#8217;s report recognised that, as a consequence of technological and commercial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">changes, the ability of newspapers to disseminate<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> public</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> mass</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> information</span></span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Report of the Royal Commission made a number of recommendations, some of which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">added important detail to the central proposal of the formation of this &#8216;General Council&#8217;. For</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">instance, the Commission recommended that the Press Council be made up of 25 members,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a proportion of whom (some 20%) would be appointed from outside the industry and would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ensure that lay interests were adequately represented. The Commission&#8217;s Report also set</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out what Sir William David Ross and his fellow commissioners regarded as the necessary and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">non-negotiable elements of an effective regulatory regime for the British press. These were: a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">code of conduct; powers to adjudicate and rule on complaints, including those received from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">third parties as much as from individuals directly affected, and powers to impose sanctions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where appropriate. It was intended by the Commission that the Press Council should have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficient powers to maintain press standards and where appropriate to impose sanctions for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">poor conduct:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It should have the right to consider any complaints which it may receive about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the conduct of the Press or of any persons towards the Press, to deal with these</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">complaints in whatever manner may seem to it practicable and appropriate, and to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">include in an annual report a statement of any action taken.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is clear from the recommendations made by the Royal Commission that it intended that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press Council should have a broad remit, encompassing a number of potentially problematic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and conflicting functions; this would include being a champion of press freedom as well as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a defender of the rights of members of the public who might have been mistreated by the</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">press. In addition the Royal Commission proposed that the General Council of the Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should have appropriate powers to monitor and rule on the terms and conditions of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">employment of journalists and other newspaper workers, whilst also promoting the interests</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of consumers and conducting research into the long-term social and economic impacts of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">print industry. The Commission was clear; its proposals were not intended<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> safeguard</span><span style="font-style:italic"> its</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">own liberty&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> but</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span> &#8220;save the press from itself.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although Parliament unconditionally accepted the recommendations of the Commission, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry response to them was slow and much wrangling and negotiation followed. Indeed,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it has been convincingly argued by some commentators that such progress was only made as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a consequence of the real threat of statutory regulation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That came about in this way. The initial industry response of the press to the Report of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Royal Commission found little favour with the then Government. That response was seen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as concentrating too much power in the hands of already powerful newspaper proprietors,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">and paying too little heed to many of the recommendations contained in the report. The NUJ</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also declared the newspaper industry&#8217;s proposals to be unacceptable to the Union and its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">members.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-12"><a href="#para2-12" name="para2-12">2.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">To deal with what appeared to be a palpable lack of progress and refusal on the part of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper industry to grapple with the fundamental criticisms and concerns at the heart of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Royal Commission&#8217;s report, in November 1952 the Labour backbench MP, CJ Simmons,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the backing of a number of members of the Shadow Cabinet, introduced a Private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Member&#8217;s Bill. This Bill was intended to establish a Press Council in statute. The threat of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statutory regulation quickly persuaded newspaper publishers to come to an agreement that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was deemed satisfactory to the Conservative Government, which then took action to prevent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a second reading of the Bill.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When it was eventually established in 1953, the General Council of the Press, as had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fashioned by the industry and endorsed by the Conservative Government, was substantially</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different from the proposals that had been recommended by the Royal Commission. In many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">respects, the changes which had been made to the structures and functions of the nascent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press Council were to the benefit of the industry and not to those who complained of having</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been the victims of press mistreatment. Significantly, proposals for lay representation on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Press Council, including the appointment of Chairman from outside the industry, had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been dropped. Further, the recommendation that the Press Council be able to investigate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and make findings on complaints brought by members of the public was changed so that,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in most circumstances, only complaints by persons affected by stories would be accepted;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">third party complaints would be entertained on a discretionary basis and exceptionally. Other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations relating to the promotion of standards and the employment conditions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of journalists and other newspaper employees were also omitted from the final proposals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">brought forward by the industry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></span>

<h2>3.  The royal Commission of 1962 and the Younger Committee into privacy </h2>


<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The General Council of the Press was neither the body nor the panacea that the Royal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commission had intended. From the outset it was the subject of criticism, particularly from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those who thought themselves the victims of press mistreatment. It was seen as self-serving</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and concerned more with defending the interests of journalists and newspaper editors than</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">in addressing the many issues identified by the first Royal Commission on the press. In 1961</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a second Royal Commission was established:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...to examine the economic and financial factors affecting the production and sale of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapers, magazines and other periodicals in the United Kingdom.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Shawcross, a former Labour Attorney General and then President of the Board of Trade,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">later becoming a cross-bench peer, was appointed Chairman of the second Royal Commission.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Shawcross was a passionate defender of press freedoms and had spoken publicly on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subject on a number of occasions. He brought a formidable intellect to the task as well as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reputation for gravitas and forensic analysis achieved as Chief UK Counsel for the Prosecution</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the post-war Nuremberg trials.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The establishment of a second Royal Commission on the press was prompted in part by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">closure of a number of national and provincial newspapers which had led to a further, and to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some, worrying concentration in the ownership of newspaper titles. Its primary purpose was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to look at the costs of production, printing and distribution as well as at the nascent impact of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">television on readership and advertising revenues, and to consider whether these factors had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">affected the diversity of ownership and control. The terms of reference to the Commission</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained it thus:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...to examine the economic and financial factors affecting the production and sale of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapers, magazines and other periodicals in the United Kingdom.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Commission was not primarily concerned with the performance of the press or with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">questions of ethical behaviour, and indeed its terms of reference made no express reference</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to either of these matters. But its very establishment reflected political and public concern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the steady build up of complaint, as well as public disapproval, at press behaviour. Some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contemporary commentators sought to explain this further decline in standards through the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prism of increased competition for circulation. Others called into question the effectiveness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the overall system of self-regulation through the General Council of the Press, decrying its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inability to put an end to press intrusion into the private lives of individuals.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup> It is a matter of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some significance that Lord Shawcross commented on the failure to heed the lessons of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">first Royal Commission:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;[h]ad they been carried out much of our own inquiry might have been unnecessary&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Shawcross Commission published its findings in September 1962. The Commission</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">levelled substantial criticism at the General Council of the Press for, in particular, its failure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to implement many of the recommendations made by the first Royal Commission on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press. These specifically included those recommendations relating to the monitoring and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforcementofstandards,theinvolvementof layrepresentativeson theCouncil and its failure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to heed recommendations relating to the monitoring of levels of newspaper ownership.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Shawcross Commission clearly identified those issues that it deemed had led to a decline</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in press standards, and it called for an improvement in the performance of the General Council</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Press. However, the solutions it proposed were little different from those articulated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the first Royal Commission in 1949. It recognised the desirability of a voluntary system of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">self-regulation for the press, but made clear that any such system of regulation would need to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be built around an effective and credible body rather than the General Council of the Press as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was then constituted. It recommended that the industry should be given two years to bring</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">forward, develop and implement appropriate plans but, should these not be forthcoming,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommended that the Government should introduce the legislation necessary to establish a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press Council in statute, with powers equivalent to those recommended originally by the first</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Royal Commission in 1949. Lord Shawcross said at the time:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;If... the Press is not willing to invest the Council with the necessary authority and to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contribute the necessary finance the case for a statutory body with definite powers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the right to levy the industry is a clear one&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Anxious at the potential threat of statutory legislation, the industry response to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations of the second Royal Commission was rather swifter than had been the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case following the first Royal Commission. The General Council of the Press was reformed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as the Press Council. For the first time it included lay representation on its board. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newly formed Press Council also made amendments to its constitution to reflect the wider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations made by the Commission. Clauses that were no longer regarded as relevant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to its role and remit were removed and, in particular, a new clause was introduced in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the consideration of complaints about the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup> This empowered the Press Council to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deal with them<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> whatever</span><span style="font-style:italic"> manner</span><span style="font-style:italic"> might</span><span style="font-style:italic"> seem</span><span style="font-style:italic"> practical</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> appropriate&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup> The reformed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press Council also took a more proactive approach to the consideration of some of the most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significant challenges facing the press and published guidance on contempt of court, privacy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and defamation.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These reforms, however, were not universally well-received. Questions were asked almost</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">immediately about the ability of the Press Council to regulate the actions and conduct of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers.Thesehadalteredlittleovertime,andthepresscontinuedtopushattheboundaries</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of what was considered acceptable journalism. Coverage of the Profumo scandal and, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular, the Sun&#8217;s exclusive interview with Christine Keeler, as well as the vilification of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the child-killer Mary Bell, by turns titivated, entranced and horrified the public. Further,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allegations of payments for stories relating to the Profumo affair, as well as to witnesses in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the case of the Moors Murders, undermined confidence in the efficacy of the Press Council</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as the regulatory body for the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup> Perhaps unsurprisingly, by the end of the decade there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were calls for a further Royal Commission on the press as well as an inquiry into the workings</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The introduction of a Private Members Bill on privacy forced the hand of the Wilson</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government, and in 1970 a new Committee looking, once again, at the behaviour of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press was constituted.</span>

<h3>The Younger Committee</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-10"><a href="#para3-10" name="para3-10">3.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Committee on Privacy, chaired by Sir Kenneth Younger, was established to examine</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a number of issues relating to the personal privacy, including the responses of the Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council to alleged breaches of privacy in the press. Sir Kenneth Younger was a barrister by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">training and former Labour Party politician who had served as a junior Home Office Minister</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the Government of Clement Atlee. After leaving Parliament in 1957, Sir Kenneth had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">campaigned for progressive political reform with regard to a number of social issues including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the legalisation of homosexuality and reform of prison conditions.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-11"><a href="#para3-11" name="para3-11">3.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Published in July 1972, the report of the Younger Committee on privacy was highly critical of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Press Council and its seeming inability to command the confidence of the British public.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Committee suggested a causal link between the level of lay representation on the Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council and the overall credibility of that organisation in the public mind. The Commission</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">duly recommended that the Press Council increase the representation of lay members; it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also recommended that steps be taken to ensure the independence of lay appointments</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because, in its view, the process of appointment was both opaque and too readily open to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">influence from the industry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup> Of the recommendations made by the Younger Committee,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perhaps the most significant related to the publication of Press Council adjudications by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers. The Younger Committee suggested that where an adverse adjudication had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been issued by the Council, it should be given similar prominence to that given to the original</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">article.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup> The Younger Committee also recommended that the Council make efforts to codify</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its adjudications on privacy and build up a body of case law understood by the industry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-12"><a href="#para3-12" name="para3-12">3.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is perhaps indicative of the prevailing mood that the Committee did not unanimously agree</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the recommendations made in the final report. However, a minority of the commissioners</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whoworkedtogetherwithSirKenneth,didnotbelievetherecommendationstobesufficiently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">far-reaching, and a minority report was published which recommended among other things</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a general law of privacy to provide individuals with proper protection from unjustified press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intrusion.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-13"><a href="#para3-13" name="para3-13">3.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The reforms of the Press Council, which were finally implemented in July 1973, did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">encompass the most significant of the recommendations made in the Younger Report. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular, recommendations on the prominence of adjudications and the codification of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rulings had been dropped. Lay membership on the Press Council was increased by four to ten,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which was exactly half the number of industry representatives. Begrudgingly accepting the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Committee&#8217;s recommendation, the Chairman of the Press Council, Lord Pearce, noted that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Younger Report had provided &#8216;no evidence&#8217; to support the conclusions it made linking public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">confidence in the Press Council to the proportion of lay representatives but, nonetheless,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Following the publication of the Younger Report, public criticism of the Press Council,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">characterised by Lord Pearce as &#8216;assaults on the principle of self-regulation,&#8217; became more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commonplace.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup> Certainly, the tensions between the regulator, the regulated and the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were made more acute by the political and social tensions between the Government, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">trade unions and the industry more broadly, and did little to address the failings, both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perceived and actual, of the Press Council. Indeed, the performance of the Press Council was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regarded by the Government of the day as so inadequate that, within a year of publication of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Kenneth Younger&#8217;s report, not only was a third Royal Commission on the Press established,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but it was given an express remit to examine in detail<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> responsibilities,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> constitution</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span></span>

<h2>4. The royal Commission of 1974</h2>

<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Third Royal Commission on the Press was established on 7 March 1974 under the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chairmanship of Professor Oliver (later Lord) MacGregor, then a leading academic in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">field of socio-legal studies and medical sociology and, immediately before his appointment, a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford. Much later, he was appointed first Chairman of the Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Complaints Commission.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The MacGregor Commission was constituted not only in the context of ongoing discussions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the recommendations of the Younger Report on privacy but also against a continuing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">backdrop of concern at the behaviour of journalists and the press more widely. Public and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political frustration was also growing at the apparent inability of the Press Council to curb</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the worst excess of such behaviour or to provide sufficient redress to those who had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wronged by the press. The MacGregor Commission was granted a broad remit and was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">invited to:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...inquire into the factors affecting the maintenance of the independence, diversity</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and editorial standards of newspapers and periodicals and the public freedom of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">choice of newspapers and periodicals, nationally, regionally and locally.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When it reported in 1977, the McGregor Commission sought to explain the real difficulties it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had faced in reaching its recommendations. The Commission expressed concern that there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was no real public or political consensus on the role of press in British society. It recognised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the press should not be subject to state control but it refused to advocate a press that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was subject only to the unregulated forces of the market and the pursuit of profit.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup> Although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undecided on the most suitable form of regulation for the press, the Commission was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unequivocal in its criticism of the Press Council both as a regulator of press standards and as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">able to provide appropriate means of redress. It recommended wholesale changes to both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the structure and functions of the Press Council.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Commission&#8217;s proposals for reform of the Press Council included a reiteration of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dormant recommendations of the first and second Royal Commissions as to the prominence</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissions and the Younger Commission, also proposed that the question of confidence in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thePressCouncilshouldbeaddressedthroughanincreaseinthenumberoflayrepresentatives</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the appointment of a lay Chairman. It also recommended that the Press Council should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seek to curb the worst excesses of the press through the development and implementation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a written code of conduct. The Commission&#8217;s report noted:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...it is unhappily certain that the Council has so far failed to persuade the</span>

<p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The MacGregor Commission also made recommendations intended to effect a fundamental</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">shift in the treatment and handling by the Press Council of complaints made by members of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public. It proposed that the Press Council should not only act as mediator and arbitrator of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints but should also actively seek, where appropriate, to secure the swift publication of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">adjudications, where necessary on the front page. The MacGregor Commission also entered</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In line with the approach of the Second Royal Commission, the final report of the MacGregor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commission suggested that if the response of the industry and Press Council was insufficient</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to address ongoing concerns as to press conduct and restore confidence in the Press Council,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then a statutory solution might need to be sought.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup> That said, Professor MacGregor remained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hopeful that such measures would not be necessary. The conclusion to its report set out its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aspiration and belief that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref38" href="#footnote38">38</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...these recommendations will be accepted and acted on by the Press Council, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that it will fulfil the hopes that were held for it in 1949.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In a yet further parallel to the Younger Review, the MacGregor Commission published a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">minority report, its adherents taking the line that more was needed to modify the culture,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and ethics of the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref39" href="#footnote39">39</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-8"><a href="#para4-8" name="para4-8">4.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Much as the publication of the MacGregor Report in 1977 had mirrored the publication of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Shawcross report in 1962, there were many similarities between the reactions of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press Council and the industry to the two sets of recommendations. The Press Council</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rejected the most significant recommendations of the MacGregor Commission, arguing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that they amounted to an unnecessary restraint on the press and muzzled freedom of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expression, despite widespread and very public calls for meaningful reform. In all, five out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of twelve of the MacGregor Commission&#8217;s recommendations for reform of the Press Council</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were explicitly rejected, including the recommendation for a written Code of Conduct, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a number of others were<span style="font-style:italic"> de</span><span style="font-style:italic"> facto</span> ignored.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup> Furthermore, where the call for reform was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">heeded and changes implemented, that implementation was partial and incomplete. As the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Media Standards Trust has fairly pointed out, this repeated the:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...previous outcomes of 1953, 1963 and 1973 (when the recommendations of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">first two Royal Commissions and the Younger Report were implemented).&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-9"><a href="#para4-9" name="para4-9">4.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of the recommendations made by the MacGregor Commission in relation to the Press Council,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only those relating to lay representation, the appointment of a Conciliator and to the seeking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of nominations &#8216;from any source&#8217; were adopted in full.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-10"><a href="#para4-10" name="para4-10">4.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Yet although the reaction of the industry was predictably obstructive, the reaction of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public was different. Whereas the newspaper industry had criticised the recommendations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made by Professor MacGregor because of the restrictions they believed the proposals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would, if implemented, have placed not only on freedom of speech but also on the ability</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of journalists to hold the rich and powerful to account, public criticism of the report focused</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the perceived weakness of its proposals, particularly in relation to the Press Council. In a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">curious twist of fate, contemporary commentators also suggested that there were unintended</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consequences to the publication of the MacGregor report, namely that the extent of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criticism of the Council in the report weakened it still further and<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;did</span><span style="font-style:italic"> little</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> improve</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">long-term credibility of that body.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup></span>

<h2>5. The first report of Sir David Calcutt QC</h2>

<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is clear that neither the MacGregor Commission nor the limited and begrudging response</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the industry to its recommendations did much to stem the increasingly growing sense</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that self-regulation of the press through the offices of the Press Council was not an effective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">means of limiting harmful press behaviour. Rather, they fostered a polarisation of the debate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the role of the press in British society and the most effective means of regulating what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">many believed to be the most harmful aspects of press behaviour. Indeed, the period</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between the publication of the report of the third Royal Commission and the formation of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Press Complaints Committee in 1990 (following the publication of the first of the reviews</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, defamatory allegations made in The Sun about the singer, Elton John</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(which led to the award of record damages for libel in 1987), the coverage of the television</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">presenter Russell Harty&#8217;s illness and subsequent death in 1988, and the coverage of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">alleged behaviour of Liverpool football fans during the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. Some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of these examples of breaches of privacy and defamatory reporting became stories in their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">own right. The growing list of high-profile incidents involving harmful press behaviour tested</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public and Parliamentary support for the Press Council and led to a &#8216;crescendo&#8217; of criticism.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The corollary to this was the continued erosion of public support for voluntary self-regulation.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It should not be doubted that contemporaneous arguments about journalistic freedoms and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the most effective means of regulating the British press were amplified through the wider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">travails and industrial disputes that afflicted the industry during this period. These paralleled</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a growing ideological divide in British politics. Back in 1974, the Labour Party had published</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">a report entitled<span style="font-style:italic"> The</span><span style="font-style:italic"> People</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Media</span> which set out its thinking on the British media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and communications markets. It proposed that a joint regulatory code should be developed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for both broadcasting and the press, and that public confidence in the regulator should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be fostered through greater transparency, regular public review of that body and a legally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforceable right of reply.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup> The report also considered the state of the press market and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perhaps unsurprisingly for a document produced by a political party which was not always</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">favourably characterised in press reporting, bemoaned a lack of accountability and bias in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press. More significantly,<span style="font-style:italic"> The</span><span style="font-style:italic"> People</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Media</span> was also strongly critical of the existing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system of self-regulation through the Press Council; whilst the Governments of Harold Wilson</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and James Callaghan did little to change the system of self-regulation for the press, the report</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">marked an fundamental shift in political support for the Press Council, which had previously</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">benefited from the tacit support of both the Labour and the Conservative Parties.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-3"><a href="#para5-3" name="para5-3">5.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Labour Party was certainly not alone in its criticism of the Press Council. The Campaign</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for Press Freedom (which would later be re-constituted as the Campaign for Press and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Broadcasting Freedom (CPF)) also advocated a complete overhaul of regulation of the press.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Perhaps unsurprisingly for an organisation that had its roots in the wider Labour movement,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the CPF pointed to what it regarded as unnecessary and destructive hostility directed at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">trade unions by newspaper proprietors. The CPF also sought to lay the blame for the lack of real</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and meaningful reform at the door of the Press Council and the system of self-regulation itself.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-4"><a href="#para5-4" name="para5-4">5.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">So concerned was the CPF at the perceived injustices of the existing system that it established</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">itsownInquiryintothePressCouncil andmattersrelatingtoit.Whenitwasfinallypublishedin</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1983, the CPF report (known as the Robertson Report on the Press Council after its Chairman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Geoffrey Robertson). The Robertson Report was unsurprisingly critical of the performance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Press Council, but recommended nevertheless that the organisation be granted one final</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opportunity to reform itself and demonstrate its efficacy as a regulator.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-5"><a href="#para5-5" name="para5-5">5.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The conclusions of the report were unambiguous about what such reforms should entail.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It recommended substantive changes to the Press Council and indeed to the existing law.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Recommendations for reform of the Press Council included the further and oft repeated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">call for the development of a published code of conduct, auditing powers to ensure the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">maintenance of high standards, as well as powers, backed by contract, to direct prominent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication of corrections.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup> The Robertson Report also recommended that the Press Council</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be given responsibility for the training and professional development of journalists. However,</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">this report also went much further in its recommendations than just proposals for the reform</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Press Council. It also recommended substantive legislative change. Proposals put</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">forward by the CPF included legislation to establish a statutory press ombudsman, to provide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a defence in law for investigative journalism, a Freedom of Information Act and changes to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the laws on libel and contempt.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-6"><a href="#para5-6" name="para5-6">5.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Reference has already been made to examples of press misconduct in the 1980s, but it would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be incorrect to suggest that the Press Council was always silent in these circumstances.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Indeed, under the leadership of its final Chairman Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC, the Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council made significant efforts better to represent ordinary people and the victims of press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mistreatment.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup> However, there is little evidence to suggest that such rulings were respected</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or observed by the industry. Indeed, in material submitted by Sir Louis to the Inquiry, he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has made clear his belief that the Press Council ultimately failed because its rulings were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">routinely, though not always, traduced and undermined in the pages of newspapers, thereby</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only serving to undermine public confidence in that body.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-7"><a href="#para5-7" name="para5-7">5.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The perceived inability of the Press Council to take credible and effective action in these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cases of press mistreatment further damaged its reputation. Increasingly, it was regarded as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ineffective both as a regulator of press conduct and as a means of redress for those who had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suffered harm. Consequent opprobrium at the Press Council was not restricted to those who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were the victims of press misconduct, but also extended to policy makers and to some of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those involved in the industry. Already in 1980, the NUJ had withdrawn its membership from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Press Council on the grounds that it was not only incapable of internal reform but also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not able effectively to improve the behaviour of the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-8"><a href="#para5-8" name="para5-8">5.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Parliamentary concern at the behaviour of some parts of the press was such that in 1989</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">two Private Members&#8217; Bills were put before Parliament. These were intended to address</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the intrusive practices conducted by some journalists and the lack of redress available</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to those who had been the victims of them. The first of the two Bills was laid before the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">House of Commons by a Conservative MP, John Browne. His Bill proposed the introduction</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a privacy tort, envisaged as a means of helping to protect individuals from unwarranted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intrusion by the press. The second such Bill was introduced by Tony Worthington, a Labour</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MP. This proposed the creation of a statutory Press Commission Appeal Tribunal with legally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforceable sanctions. Introducing his Bill to Parliament, Mr Worthington expressed the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hope that it would improve access to redress for those who had been the victims of press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mistreatment and speed up the process of dealing with complaints.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-9"><a href="#para5-9" name="para5-9">5.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These Private Members&#8217; Bills were not the only attempts by Parliamentarians to tackle</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perceived press wrong-doing and the seeming inability of the Press Council to police press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">excesses effectively, although they were the last before the eventual appointment of Sir David</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Calcutt in 1989. For example:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref49" href="#footnote49">49</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-10"><a href="#para5-10" name="para5-10">5.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Government responded to this continual build-up of pressure for both the reform of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press Council and the introduction of effective curbs on the worst excesses of press practice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by appointing a Departmental Committee, chaired by Sir David Calcutt QC, to investigate the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matter. Sir David was asked:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...to consider what measures (whether legislative or otherwise) are needed to give</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">further protection to individual privacy from the activities of the press and improve</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recourse against the press for the individual citizen.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-11"><a href="#para5-11" name="para5-11">5.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir David published his report on Privacy and Related Matters in June 1990. It is clear from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">content of the report that the members of the Committee considered its remit to go beyond</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a limited discussion of privacy and encompass the existing system of press regulation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">51</a></sup> The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">final report was highly critical of the Press Council and set out in clear terms the failings of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that organisation. These included: its ineffectiveness as an adjudicator; the lack of confidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in its independence from the newspaper industry; its tendency to reject large numbers of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints; the lack of clarity in its selection and categorisation of complaints; the time taken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to resolve contested cases; and the lack of effective sanctions in instances of proven breach.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref52" href="#footnote52">52</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-12"><a href="#para5-12" name="para5-12">5.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, contrary to the expectations of a number of contemporary commentators, Sir David</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Calcutt&#8217;s first report did not advocate the introduction of statutory controls for the press.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rather, it recommended that the Press Council should be abolished and replaced with a new</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">self-regulatory organisation; the Press Complaints Commission (PCC). The report argued that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press be given:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...one final chance to prove that voluntary self-regulation can be made to work.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">However, we do not consider that the Press Council, even if reformed as proposed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in its internal review, should be kept as part of the system. We therefore recommend</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the Press Council should be disbanded and replaced by a new body, specifically</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">charged with adjudicating on complaints of press malpractice. This body must be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">seen to be authoritative, independent and impartial. It must also have jurisdiction</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">over the press as a whole, must be adequately funded and must provide a means</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of seeking to prevent publication of intrusive material. We consider it particularly</span>

<p id="para-id-5-13"><a href="#para5-13" name="para5-13">5.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The report recommended that this new body should deal with the numerous and substantial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns that had been raised around the behaviour of some parts of the press. In contrast</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the three Royal Commissions, the Calcutt Committee did not make a large number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations for specific reforms. Rather, it set out a framework of measures that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Committee regarded as the necessary elements of an effective self-regulatory regime. The</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">redress for complaints made by members of the public against the press, including the ability</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to consider allegations of unfair treatment and unwarranted infringements of privacy. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">addition, the Commission was to<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;publish,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> monitor</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> implement&#8221;</span> a comprehensive code</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">hotline for complainants.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-15"><a href="#para5-15" name="para5-15">5.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir David also made clear that the adjudication of complaints should be a clear and fast process</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that, where a newspaper was demonstrated to be in breach of the code, an apology</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be given to the complainant. Sir David also recommended that the PCC should be able</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to advise on the form and placing of replies or corrections. It is noteworthy that Sir David&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">report made no mention of sanctions and instead placed emphasis on the preparedness of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press to adhere to the adjudications of the PCC.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-16"><a href="#para5-16" name="para5-16">5.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition, Sir David&#8217;s report made a small number of specific recommendations about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">structure and function of the PCC, intended to address concerns expressed by the three</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Royal Commissions as to the independence of the organisation. The report recommended</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the PCC should have an independent Chairman supported by a Commission made up of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no more the twelve Commissioners. These would be appointed by a separate independent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appointments commission which would select and appoint on the basis of merit alone.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-17"><a href="#para5-17" name="para5-17">5.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As had been the case after the second Royal Commission(but not other reviews less favourable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the press), the response of the industry was swift. The Press Council was duly disbanded,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and in the spring of 1990 the five publishing associations in the UK (the Newspaper Publishers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Association,theNewspaperSociety,thePeriodicalPublishersAssociation,ScottishNewspapers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Publishers Association and the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society) worked together to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">establish the Press Standards Board of Finance (PressBoF) for the specific purpose of funding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC. The PCC was itself incorporated on 1 January 1991 and, in a nod to the history of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the self-regulation of the press as well as in recognition of his very real qualifications for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">post, Lord McGregor was appointed as its first Chairman.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref57" href="#footnote57">57</a></sup> However, the full Commission was</span>

<h2>6. The second report of Sir David Calcutt QC</h2>

<p id="para-id-6-1"><a href="#para6-1" name="para6-1">6.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although the PCC had been established speedily, standards of press behaviour remained a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern to politicians and members of the public alike because no immediate improvement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in press behaviour was discerned. Indeed it has been suggested that despite the speed and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">promise of its establishment, the PCC quickly followed the<span style="font-style:italic"> modus</span><span style="font-style:italic"> operandi</span> demonstrated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the Press Council in its responses to the Royal Commissions and Sir Kenneth Younger&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">report on privacy in 1972.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup> Many of the recommendations made by Sir David Calcutt were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">either quietly shelved or ignored by the PCC. Others were modified or implemented in a</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">manner that benefitted the industry. For instance, the Code of Conduct was promulgated by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the industry rather than the PCC itself and, as indicated above, the appointments process was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not independent.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-2"><a href="#para6-2" name="para6-2">6.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Commission also struggled to impose its authority on the industry; it has been argued</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, in failing to commit to dealing with complaints from third parties, or indeed establish any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigatory arm, the regulatory function and capacity of the newly formed Commission was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;gravely weakened&#8217; from the outset.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup> In 1992 the Labour MP, Clive Soley, introduced a Private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Member&#8217;s Bill on Freedom and Responsibility of the Press. The Bill proposed the creation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a statutory Independent Press Authority, with powers to enforce its rulings through the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">courts. Clive (now Lord) Soley has suggested that his Private Member&#8217;s Bill was intended to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complement thinking around Sir David&#8217;s forthcoming follow-up review.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref61" href="#footnote61">61</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-3"><a href="#para6-3" name="para6-3">6.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Following the publication in The Sun of the detail of intimate conversations between the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Princess of Wales and James Gilbey, and the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(as she now is), the Secretary of State for National Heritage, David Mellor QC MP, gave a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">speech in July 1992 in which he reflected widespread public anger at the actions of The Sun.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He described the press as drinking in the<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;last</span><span style="font-style:italic"> chance</span><span style="font-style:italic"> saloon&#8221;</span> . Mr Mellor later complained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that his stance on the need for reform of the press led to him being driven from office by a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">series of salacious stories about his private life although he acknowledges that the timing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was coincidental.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref62" href="#footnote62">62</a></sup> Perhaps with greater ambiguity, he has also suggested that some of that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">coverage was legitimate and a matter of public interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-4"><a href="#para6-4" name="para6-4">6.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In July 1992, Sir David Calcutt was asked by the Secretary of State for National Heritage to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conduct a second review, the report from which was published in January 1993. This was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">just before Mr Mellor had left office in the circumstances explained above. David Mellor&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explanation to the Inquiry was that 18 months had elapsed since the press had been described</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by him as drinking in the<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;last</span><span style="font-style:italic"> chance</span><span style="font-style:italic"> saloon&#8221;</span> in December 1989, and the matter needed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be re-assessed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref63" href="#footnote63">63</a></sup> There, Sir David analysed the record of self-regulation by the press since the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">formation of the PCC in January 1991. Sir David&#8217;s assessment was forthright. He contended</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">that self-regulation by the PCC had failed and called for the introduction of a statutory Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Complaints Tribunal. He summarised his conclusions as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref64" href="#footnote64">64</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Press Complaints Commission is not, in my view, an effective regulator of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press. It has not been set up in a way, and is not operating a code of practice, which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enables it to command not only press but also public confidence. It does not, in my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">view, hold the balance fairly between the press and the individual. It is not the truly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">independent body which it should be. As constituted it is, in essence, a body set up</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by the industry, financed by the industry, dominated by the industry, and operating a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">code of practice devised by the industry and which is over-favourable to the industry.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-5"><a href="#para6-5" name="para6-5">6.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir David&#8217;s second report made clear his view that the press was neither capable nor willing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to initiate reforms that might constitute a credible alternative to statutory regulation. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">therefore recommended that the proposals set out in his first report for a statutory &#8220;Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Complaints Tribunal&#8221; be enacted forthwith:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref65" href="#footnote65">65</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It has been argued that two years is too short a time in which to judge the Press</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Complaints Commission. But the way forward was clearly spelt out in the Privacy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Committee&#8217;sReport.Inparticular,theCommitteestressedtheneedfortheCommission</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">tobeseenasanindependentbodywhichwouldcommandtheconfidenceofthepublic.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Both the Committee, and subsequently the Government, gave a clear indication that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this was the last chance for the industry to put its own house in order. It has to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">assumed that the industry, in setting up the present Press Complaints Commission,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">has gone as far as it was prepared to go. But it has not gone far enough.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-6"><a href="#para6-6" name="para6-6">6.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If the conclusions reached in Sir David Calcutt&#8217;s second report were damning of the PCC, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations for change were equally alarming for the supporters of self-regulation. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">final report contained a detailed set of proposals for the wide-ranging powers that should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">granted to that body. These included powers to establish and maintain a code of practice,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prevent the publication of material in breach of the code, handle complaints in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to alleged breaches of the code (including from third parties), investigate and adjudicate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on breaches without a complaint, require the publication of adjudications, apologies and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">corrections, and, where appropriate, to hold full hearings.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref66" href="#footnote66">66</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-7"><a href="#para6-7" name="para6-7">6.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC and the industry rejected the analysis of Sir David. They argued that he had failed to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Indeed, Sir David&#8217;s proposals were seen as a step too far by even the most adamantine critics</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref68" href="#footnote68">68</a></sup> However, the PCC did accept that some reform was required and under the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">leadership of its second Chairman, Lord Wakeham, changes were made to aspects of policy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and procedure, largely to improve and expedite the complaints handling procedures.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref69" href="#footnote69">69</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">members (nine, including the Chair, alongside seven serving editors). Similar changes were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also made to the independent Appointments Committee.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-9"><a href="#para6-9" name="para6-9">6.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In further changes, the industry agreed that the PCC should be granted powers to ratify, if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so advised, the changes to the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice recommended by the Editors&#8217; Code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Practice Committee. Funding to the Commission was also increased substantially. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enabled the development and introduction of a hotline for members of the public specifically</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to deal with incidents of harassment by members of the press, as had been recommended in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir David&#8217;s first report.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-10"><a href="#para6-10" name="para6-10">6.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The weakness of the press response to the second Calcutt report, as part of an overall</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">narrative, was demonstrated by an example provided by Lord Brooke, the Secretary of State</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for National Heritage between July 1992 and September 1994. He recalled that in 1993 the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sunday Mirror published photographs of the Princess of Wales exercising in a private gym.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref71" href="#footnote71">71</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord McGregor, then Chairman of the PCC, issued a public rebuke of the Sunday Mirror; but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">instead of showing contrition the paper&#8217;s response was to leave the system of self-regulation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">through the PCC.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref72" href="#footnote72">72</a></sup> Lord Brooke suggested that this incident was instructive at many levels,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">demonstrating not only the weaknesses existing within the system of regulation, but also the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">refusal of the press to begin to countenance change until compelled to do so as a consequence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of public indignation at its behaviour.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref73" href="#footnote73">73</a></sup> Lord Brooke described the matter thus:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref74" href="#footnote74">74</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">of the Mirror in the first week of November 1993, when the photographs were taken</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">of Princess Diana working out in a gymnasium, had a very powerful effect on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">behaviour of the press immediately, because they had been resisting anything that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in any way related to &#8211; either to Calcutt or to ourselves and indeed others, and then</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">suddenly changed their minds when they realised that an episode as absurd as the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mirror episode, where the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission rebuked the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mirror &#8211; the Sunday Mirror, in fact &#8211; rebuked the Sunday Mirror for their behaviour,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">first led the Sunday Mirror to walk out of the Press Complaints Commission, and then</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to come back, and it was clear that some of the things that were being said to them</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about the degree of control that they had were actually being proved by reality.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Government did not immediately respond to Sir David&#8217;s second report. Rather, it waited</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">until 1995, when the Secretary of State for National Heritage, Virginia Bottomley MP, rejected</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his recommendation for statutory regulation and instead supported the package of reforms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that had been proposed by Lord Wakeham. The Inquiry has heard from witnesses who have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sought to explain the nature of the Government&#8217;s response. Sir John Major has told the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry that, although a matter of concern to his Government, the conduct of the press could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not be regarded as a priority, nor, he noted, was there any agreement within the Government</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the most desirable way forward.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref75" href="#footnote75">75</a></sup> He recounted that his Government had to contend with</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir John&#8217;s recollection of events has found a complementary echo in the evidence of Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Brooke. He told the Inquiry that there was little appetite in Cabinet for the statutory solution</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposed by Sir David in his second report.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref78" href="#footnote78">78</a></sup> Lord Brooke also explained that a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legislative proposals, through which press intrusion might be addressed,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref79" href="#footnote79">79</a></sup> had been put</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">forward by different Government departments. These included both a privacy tort and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposals to make some forms of intrusion a criminal offence. Lord Brooke noted that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although there was some agreement in Cabinet on bringing forward legislation to introduce</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal offences, there was less accord in relation to the introduction of a tort of privacy.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref80" href="#footnote80">80</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-13"><a href="#para6-13" name="para6-13">6.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Stephen Dorrell, the Secretary of State for National Heritage from July 1994 to July 1995, was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsible for the formulation but not the publication of the response to the second Calcutt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">report. He has helped complete this picture. He said that such were the disagreements in</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cabinet around both the likelihood of the Government enacting legislation and the desirability</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of regulating the press, that the Government had<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;argued</span><span style="font-style:italic"> itself</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> standstill&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref81" href="#footnote81">81</a></sup> He also noted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the reforms to the PCC proposed and then implemented by Lord Wakeham increasingly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appeared to meet the needs set out by Sir David Calcutt without the requirement for time-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consuming and controversial legislation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref82" href="#footnote82">82</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-14"><a href="#para6-14" name="para6-14">6.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nonetheless, many have suggested that Lord Wakeham&#8217;s appointment and tenure was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very much in the interest of the press. Lord Smith summarised industry thinking behind his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appointment in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref83" href="#footnote83">83</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think the newspaper industry did not want statutory control and that they accepted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they needed someone to be the chairman with a bit of clout, who could stop statutory</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">control by getting the standards up to an acceptable level, and this was my view of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what I thought they probably wanted.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir John Major explained why Lord Wakeham&#8217;s appointment might well have been valued by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the industry itself:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref84" href="#footnote84">84</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I mean, those who were at all queasy about it would then say, &#8220;Look, here is one</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of our own, a very respected former Cabinet Minister who is actually chairing the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">PCC. Therefore, why don&#8217;t we wait and see how well he gets on? Why rush ahead</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with legislation?&#8221; So his appointment did have a material effect upon views in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Parliamentary party.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, Lord Wakeham was not appointed simply for his political skills. In perhaps the most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important respect, he shared the values which were most cherished to the industry which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC was regulating. Lord Wakeham explained that he was a strong supporter of both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press freedom and self-regulation:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref85" href="#footnote85">85</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you could be a chairman of a body that was running a system of self-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regulation unless you believed in self-regulation. I think that would be a bit difficult.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">And I can&#8217;t imagine you being a very good chairman of a Press Council if you didn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">believe in press freedom. I would have thought they were pretty self-evidently things</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that were required for the job.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-16"><a href="#para6-16" name="para6-16">6.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whilst it is clear that the PCC did introduce reform during the chairmanship of Lord Wakeham,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including the appointment of a Privacy Commissioner tasked with the oversight of each and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">every complaint to do with privacy, these changes did not amount to the creation of the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisation envisaged by Sir David Calcutt in his first report, but rather a PCC that met the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">minimum requirements of a Government increasingly disinclined to effect major reforms of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the system of press regulation and fearful of the political ramifications of any such change.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-17"><a href="#para6-17" name="para6-17">6.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC won support in some quarters, including in Government, for the breadth of its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposed reforms and their speed of implementation. But the frank evidence of Sir John</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Major is pertinent on this issue:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref86" href="#footnote86">86</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In retrospect, yes. I mean, there were some things done. It has to be said on behalf</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the PCC that it did make some changes. They were relatively trivial changes,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but they were changes. And they also, if I remember correctly, appointed a privacy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">commissioner from among their numbers, a Professor Pinker, at the time. So there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were things that they had done, and the hope that Stephen Dorrell is expressing there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is that John Wakeham would be able to persuade the media, the press, to go a good</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deal further than they already had done. It was, as you say, aspirational.&#8221;</span>

<h2>7. The death of Diana, princess of Wales</h2>

<p id="para-id-7-1"><a href="#para7-1" name="para7-1">7.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 was a wake-up call for the press. Although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it did not generate a specific inquiry into press ethics, it did reignite a public demand for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">improvements in press behaviour.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-2"><a href="#para7-2" name="para7-2">7.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Considered as a whole, the reforms introduced in response to the public outcry were the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">most comprehensive ever introduced by the PCC. It should not be doubted that the reforms,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which concerned amendments to clauses 4 and 6 of the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice, did have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an impact on the behaviour and actions of journalists, press photographers and paparazzi.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-3"><a href="#para7-3" name="para7-3">7.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nonetheless, it is apparent from the evidence that these changes were, as so many before,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hard won from the industry and not freely given. Lord Smith provided a detailed description</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the protracted negotiations between his Department and the industry through the offices</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the PCC, in which despite the tragic background, the quite extraordinary levels of public</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">concern, and the willingness of the PCC to act in the first instance as regulator and then</span>

<p id="para-id-7-4"><a href="#para7-4" name="para7-4">7.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Smith told the Inquiry that it was Government policy to seek to strengthen the system</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of self regulation and, in particular, to bring about changes in relation to sanctions, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">definition of the public interest, and the issue of PCC pro-activity.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref88" href="#footnote88">88</a></sup> Lord Smith made clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he thought that tackling these three issues would effect far-reaching and lasting change</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the attitudes of the industry such that the press<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;should</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> slip</span><span style="font-style:italic"> back</span><span style="font-style:italic"> into</span><span style="font-style:italic"> old</span><span style="font-style:italic"> ways</span><span style="font-style:italic"> when</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the events of the past week have receded from recent memory&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref89" href="#footnote89">89</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-5"><a href="#para7-5" name="para7-5">7.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, it is quite clear from the evidence both of Lord Smith and Lord Wakeham that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry was unwilling to make concession in these respects. Rather the changes that were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">finally adopted were confined to those very few areas outlined above most closely associated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the direct circumstances surrounding the death of Princess Diana. Lord Smith testified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the industry demonstrated a disinclination to agree to any changes and did so only under</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">duress after considerable public and political pressure was brought to bear. In his evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Smith recalled a meeting with Lord Wakeham in which the latter said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref90" href="#footnote90">90</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;If the government can keep up some external pressure on me, pushing me all the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">time to go a bit further, then that will be very helpful, he said, in enabling me to make</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">better progress with the editors and proprietors.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-6"><a href="#para7-6" name="para7-6">7.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Even in the evidence of Lord Wakeham it is clear that his ability to broker a solution was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">severely circumscribed by the unwillingness of editors and proprietors to concede ground:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref91" href="#footnote91">91</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;bear in mind the changes in the code were not a matter for me; they were a matter</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for the editors under the arrangements, and I therefore had to move carefully to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">make sure the editors went along with what I wanted.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-7"><a href="#para7-7" name="para7-7">7.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">LordSmithrecognisedthatoneofthelessonsfromhistorywasthatthewindowofopportunity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for reform was short. He said that over a period of months the attitude of the PCC shifted from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operating as a regulator to championing the interests of the press. This was a metamorphosis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which it may be argued was as inevitable and it was entirely understandable, as other &#8216;real</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">world&#8217; concerns impacted, in particular in relation to the possible ramifications for the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into UK domestic law.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref92" href="#footnote92">92</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-8"><a href="#para7-8" name="para7-8">7.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further, the reforms to the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice that were introduced with effect from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1 January 1998 were neither welcomed by the press nor much observed in the longer term.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Smith described these as:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref93" href="#footnote93">93</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;... carried through, sometimes, I suspect, with gritted teeth amongst the editors and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proprietors, because there was a public wind at the back of change. But that moment</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">did not last for terribly long, and the equilibrium returned more or less to normal, which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">makes it very difficult for government to take strident steps to restrain press activity.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">changes immediately after the death of Diana, the conduct of the press did improve.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Certainly in terms of the specifics of the changes, their approach to the coverage</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the princes, handling of children and minors, some of the intrusive taking of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">photographs, there was a palpable change of behaviour. But after that two to three-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">year period, I think it began to slip, and as we know from all the evidence that you&#8217;ve</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been receiving, it slipped grievously in quite a number of ways.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-10"><a href="#para7-10" name="para7-10">7.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Evidently, the same dynamics that played in the aftermath of the reporting of the Royal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">CommissionsandthereportsofSirDavidCalcuttwerealsoapparentintheindustry&#8217;sresponse</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">at this point. The industry moved quickly to make a number of high profile but nevertheless</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">limited changes which were in any event only begrudgingly accepted. In this case, they were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ably guided by the dextrous political hand of Lord Wakeham who moved swiftly and adroitly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to secure political backing for an industry-led response to these events.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref96" href="#footnote96">96</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In 2003 Sir Christopher Meyer was appointed Chairman of the PCC, and the evolution of that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisation under his leadership is addressed elsewhere in this Report, in particular in Part J.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The organisation which he inherited was hidebound by the structural and cultural constraints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which this chapter has served to highlight. It would require a herculean task to break free</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from them.</span>

<h2>8. Conclusions</h2>

<p id="para-id-8-1"><a href="#para8-1" name="para8-1">8.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At this juncture, it is opportune that I seek to draw out some brief lessons from the history</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of press self-regulation in the UK since the foundation of the General Council for the Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in 1953, as well as the public policy response to concerns at the conduct of some sections of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-2"><a href="#para8-2" name="para8-2">8.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It must be made clear that the story is not all bad, in the sense that there have been a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of reforms in press regulation since the Second World War. That said, whilst recognising some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the good work that has been done in response to criticism, to changing attitudes and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear recommendations of the reports, it is evident that many of the lessons of the post-war</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">period have been ignored. This chapter of the Report attempts to provide only a cursory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">glance at the recent history of the British press, but it is patent that many of the concerns and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices that led to the establishment of three Royal Commissions, a Committee on privacy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the two reviews led by Sir David Calcutt, are the same as those which have led to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">establishment of this Inquiry. This has been a history of strongly recurring themes.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-3"><a href="#para8-3" name="para8-3">8.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An equally strong recurrence has been concern about the inability of &#8216;self-regulation&#8217; to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">address the underlying problem sufficiently, an inability which has been consistently pointed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out by all of those who have examined the problem in depth. The history demonstrates a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">distinct and enduring resistance to change from within the press. This replication of pattern,</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">of the wheels of history moving in concentric circles, has been demonstrated through the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press response to the recommendations made and repeated over the years, the regulators&#8217;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref97" href="#footnote97">97</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">response to those recommendations and, it must be said, the response of successive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Governments to the clear advice they have been receiving.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-4"><a href="#para8-4" name="para8-4">8.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">My conclusion on the cyclical nature of press self-regulation is not a novel one. Indeed, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was shared by many of the witnesses to the Inquiry. Lord Brooke suggested that the history</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of press self-regulation has been one of a distinct reluctance on the part of the industry to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">implement meaningful change. He noted that such change that has been effected has only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been implemented in the face of the very real threat of statutory intervention:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref98" href="#footnote98">98</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;But in the period since 1945, I observe that quite extraneous events, like a Private</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Members&#8217; Bill, actually have had the effect of moving the story on quite a lot. In the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">case of the 1949 Royal Commission under Sir William Ross, there was a proposal that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the press should have a general body of their own, and they showed no sign at all</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of doing anything about that until a backbench MP called Mr Simmons in 1952/53</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">brought in a Private Members&#8217; Bill, whereupon effectively almost instantly the press</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">came around to the original recommendation in the Royal Commission.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He continued:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref99" href="#footnote99">99</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In the same way, in 1989 &#8211; I noticed the text of Mr Dorrell&#8217;s account of how the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Calcutt 1 was set up, but its actual genesis was the report stage of Mr Worthington&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bill entitled &#8220;Right of Reply&#8221; in 1989, and the government minister responding at the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">dispatch box on that bill basically foreshadowed Calcutt 1 in his response. So these</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">things happen as a result of different, frequently unrelated episodes.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-5"><a href="#para8-5" name="para8-5">8.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Brooke perceived a causal link between the credible threat by policy makers of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">introduction of statutory regulation for the press, and the introduction by the industry of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">limited measures to improve the existing system of self-regulation for the press, a system that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has worked overall to the distinct advantage of the industry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref100" href="#footnote100">100</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The other Royal Commissions and Lord Younger&#8217;s Commission weren&#8217;t quite so</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fruitful, but then there wasn&#8217;t a Private Member around to help.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-6"><a href="#para8-6" name="para8-6">8.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The same reasoning has been pursued more forthrightly in submissions to the Inquiry by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Professor Brian Cathcart of Kingston University. He told the Inquiry that in his view the history</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of press reform is one of failure to introduce measures recommended in terms to improve</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public trust in both the press and the system of self&#8211;regulation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref101" href="#footnote101">101</a></sup> He said that the attitude of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press to change in this area has been one of foot-dragging and obfuscation, with progress</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only occurring under duress:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref102" href="#footnote102">102</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think you go back to the first Royal Commission, 1946 to 1949, I think, which reports,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recommends the setting-up of a Press Council and it takes three and a half years</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press will set something up. That, if you look through the history, and this is another</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">thing that Hacked Off is doing, that sort of conduct is repeated and repeated.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-7"><a href="#para8-7" name="para8-7">8.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Similar observations were made by the Media Standards Trust, which submitted to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry a detailed analysis of the cycle of industry-led reform.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref103" href="#footnote103">103</a></sup> Dr Martin Moore argued</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that in the face of considerable public concerns prompting the Royal Commission and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other investigations into the behaviour of the press, the industry has been unmoved until</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;threatened with the Damoclean sword of some form of statutory regulation.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref104" href="#footnote104">104</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Further,</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Moore has said the paucity of reforms implemented by the industry has led to a cycle of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;subsequent commissions, often within a decade&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> examining</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> all</span><span style="font-style:normal"> intents</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> purposes</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">TheMediaWiseTrustagreed,recallingwithsomeconcernthatrecommendationsmadebythe</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ross Commission in 1949, repeated in the report of the Shawcross Commission of 1962 and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">again by Lord McGregor in 1974, have yet to be implemented, particularly with regard to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prominence of apologies and corrections. However, in a somewhat different vein from other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commentators, the Mediawise Trust suggested that it is incorrect to describe the history as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cyclical, as this tends to obscure the fact that the calls for reform became increasingly strident</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and more forthright with time, and the refusal of the press to implement the changes at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">heart of those reports more obdurate.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-9"><a href="#para8-9" name="para8-9">8.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The historical lessons are clear enough, but the challenge for today is whether any of them</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will be taken on board. Those who complain about the conduct of the press<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref106" href="#footnote106">106</a></sup> are entitled</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to ask &#8220;How many chances must the press be given before something is done about it?&#8221; The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">problem is to decide whether that complaint is justified and, if it is, what that &#8220;something&#8221; is.</span>

The fact that most of the press do not behavein a way that requires regulation does not, however, negate the need for such regulation to deal with those whosebehaviour does not meet the high standards of the majority</p><!--footnote-->
