<h1>CHAPTER 5<br/>SOME CASE STUDIES</h1>

<h2>1.<span style="font-size: 23px;"> Introduction</span></h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The previous Chapter explored the culture, practices and ethics prevailing at the News of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">World (NoTW) before its demise. This, and the following Chapter, takes a broader view. They</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seek to examine the wider evidence submitted to the Inquiry in some detail, with a view to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">making a general assessment of the culture, practices and ethics of the press, in line with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Terms of Reference. It should be understood that it is not possible or desirable to cover all the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence submitted to the Inquiry in the Report: some of it will be referred to simply by way</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of footnotes to the main text; other parts of the evidence will not be mentioned expressly</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">at all.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In this Chapter, before proceeding to examine the evidence as a whole,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> I examine in detail a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of individual examples of press reporting in recent years. Some of those examples will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be well known to many reading this report and include the reporting of the disappearance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Amanda (Milly) Dowler, the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, the arrest of Christopher</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Jefferies on suspicion of murder and the publication of details of the medical condition of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the former Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Gordon Brown&#8217;s son. The first three of those, at least,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were chosen because they exemplified what might be described as the most egregious cases</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of unethical journalistic conduct.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The final examples included in this Chapter are defined by the fact that they are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contemporaneous with the Inquiry; they are stories which emerged during the course of, or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subsequent to, the formal hearings, and may indicate that the risks identified in the following</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chapter cannot be dismissed as historical. They include the Daily Mail&#8217;s attack on Hugh</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Grant&#8217;s &#8216;mendacious smears&#8217;, the press treatment of the family of Sebastian Bowles after his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">death, and the contrasting approach to the recent stories which impacted on the privacy of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">two members of the Royal Family.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">All (except the Royal examples) were subjected to detailed scrutiny during the course of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry. The theme common to them all, and which therefore merits their generic description</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as &#8216;case studies&#8217;, is their link to the next chapter of the Report containing the wider criticisms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the culture, practices and ethics of the press, and the emergence of patterns. In other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">words, each case study exemplifies at least one and often several of the attributes of and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">flaws in the press which have been addressed at length below;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> in this Chapter, however,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they are not addressed from the perspective of the criticism but rather from the perspective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the victim, thereby providing some insight into the overall impact of the way in which the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant story has been reported. Accordingly, the time taken to examine these cases is not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the purpose of levelling specific criticisms against individual titles and journalists (although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I recognise that this might be a by-product of the exercise) but for the light they shine on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the wider picture. It follows that the analysis of each case study will not be exhaustive; it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will merely be sufficient to illuminate and buttress the generic conclusions that I have felt it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate to reach.</span>


 <p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">What follows in this introductory section is a thumbnail sketch of each of these case studies,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a prelude to the more detailed analysis set out in subsequent chapters.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence relating to the reporting of the disappearance of Milly Dowler is examined as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the first of these case studies. This Inquiry was set up in the light of the public reaction to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Guardian&#8217;s story published on 4 July 2011 that the voicemail of Milly Dowler was hacked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into and tampered with by one or more journalists from the NoTW, such that a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her voicemail messages were deleted, thereby giving her family false hope in her well being.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence relating to these allegations will need to be examined, not least because the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Guardian later retracted that part of its story that asserted that one or more messages had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been deleted.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of equal if not greater importance, however, is that Mr and Mrs Dowler were subjected to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intrusive and insensitive press reporting at a time of intense personal distress. Such was the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appetite in certain sections of the press to acquire information and photographs which would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enable &#8216;the story&#8217; to be kept alive as one of ongoing human interest to readers, these sections</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press often overlooked the privacy rights and personal feelings of the Dowler family.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thus, the family came to be treated as little more than a commodity in which the press had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an unrestricted interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry also heard at length from Dr Kate and Dr Gerry McCann, who, following the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disappearance of their daughter Madeleine in Portugal in May 2007, were the victims of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what may only be fairly described as serial defamations in a number of newspapers between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">September 2007 and January 2008. The McCanns were initially the subject of balanced and</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">sensitive press reporting in the British press: not merely did the story attract the open-hearted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sympathy of the public, owing to the way that it resonated on a number of obvious levels, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the parents took a strategic decision at a very early stage to engage with the press in order to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">avail the search for their daughter.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By the summer of 2007, however, what had begun as a sympathetic approach by the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to an ongoing personal tragedy had altered; this change had been prompted by &#8216;leaks&#8217; from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Portuguese police to the local and British media representing their version or speculation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of what might have happened to Madeleine. Some, but certainly by no means all, sections of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press in the UK decided to run with stories which alleged that the McCanns were in some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way responsible for the disappearance of their daughter. One title prided itself in the fact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it was apparently fair minded because on one day it would print a hostile story while the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">next it would provide a more sympathetic portrayal. The defamatory reporting continued for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approximately four months, the principal perpetrator asserting that the public appetite for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the story was undiminished. Ultimately, it took the threat and then the reality of libel action</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to bring this spate of reporting to an end, and the McCanns received substantial damages and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a front page apology in settlement of their claims.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-10"><a href="#para1-10" name="para1-10">1.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It was inevitable and entirely in the public interest that there be full reporting of stories about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both Milly Dowler and Madeleine McCann. Like the Dowlers, however, the McCanns were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also treated as if they were a commodity in which the public, and by extension the press, had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an interest or stake that effectively trumped their individual rights to privacy, dignity or basic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">respect. The press believed that the public&#8217;s legitimate interest in the story was insatiable,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that belief required it to sustain that interest by following every possible development</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or turn, however implausible or apparently defamatory. Also like the Dowlers, the McCanns</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were the victims of grossly intrusive reporting, prying photographers and an ongoing &#8216;media</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">scrum&#8217; which paid little or no regard to their personal space, their own personal distress and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in particular, the interests of Madeleine&#8217;s younger siblings.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-11"><a href="#para1-11" name="para1-11">1.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are two other aspects of the McCann &#8216;case study&#8217; which merits its inclusion as such.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, the PCC did nothing until it was too late, and the reasons for this inactivity need to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be explored. Secondly, the NoTW published highly personal extracts from Dr Kate McCann&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">diary in September 2008 following a telephone conversation between its news editor and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">McCanns&#8217; spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, on 12 September. The Inquiry was provided with a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transcript of that conversation at an early stage, but without knowing the full background</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was difficult to discern the true purpose of the conversation and what was understood or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">agreed by or between the participants to it. However, when he came to give evidence, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">news editor accepted that Mr Mitchell had been deliberately misled so that it would appear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he had given his consent to the publication of the extracts on behalf of Dr McCann</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whereas in truth he had not.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-12"><a href="#para1-12" name="para1-12">1.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Another individual who was the victim of unbalanced, prejudicial and wildly inaccurate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press reporting was Christopher Jefferies, who was arrested on suspicion of being involved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the murder of Joanna Yeates on 30 December 2010. Mr Jefferies gave evidence to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry and, notwithstanding the remarkably measured and dispassionate terms in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was given, testified to a series of egregiously defamatory and unfair articles in a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of national newspapers over the New Year period, which hinted, rumoured, speculated,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggested, or at times indicated that he was the perpetrator. Again, this is a very clear example</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of injudicious, sensationalised and intemperate reporting which was designed to feed what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the newspapers concerned judged to be the curiosity and prurient interest of their readers;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this was no doubt, supported by an (entirely erroneous) assessment that the police had &#8216;got</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the right man&#8217;. In the result, the police had not: Mr Jefferies was released, initially on police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bail; subsequently, the perpetrator of Ms Yeates&#8217; murder (who had provided information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which purported to implicate Mr Jefferies) was arrested, charged and convicted at a trial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which did not challenge responsibility for the killing. Mr Jefferies brought defamation actions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">against a number of newspapers, and the Attorney General successfully brought contempt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proceedings against two.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-13"><a href="#para1-13" name="para1-13">1.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The next case study which will be examined concerns the story published in The Sun in 2006</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regarding the illness of one of Mr Brown&#8217;s children. This story is of interest for a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of connected reasons. First, even without disclosing its source so as to permit his or her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identification, The Sun has refused to explain how the story was sourced. The second reason</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns the absence of any public interest justification for publishing a story about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">health (ie the private life) of a child; and the third is the circumstances in which the paper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sought to obtain the consent of Mr and Mrs Brown to its publication. The evidence in this last</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">respect has clear resonances with the evidence of Anne Diamond, the broadcast journalist</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and presenter, relating to the death of her infant son and her enforced association with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Sun&#8217;s cot death charitable appeal, and the evidence relating to the obtaining of Dr Kate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">McCann&#8217;s consent, through a conversation with her agent, to the publication of extracts from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her personal diary.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-14"><a href="#para1-14" name="para1-14">1.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is much that could be discussed about the evidence that actor Hugh Grant provided</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and he would be the first to say that press treatment of those who have achieved what is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">called &#8216;celebrity status&#8217; should only be considered behind the complaints of people like the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dowlers, the McCanns and Mr Jefferies. He is included as a case study because of a detail in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his evidence and the reaction that it provoked. He gave evidence to the Inquiry as to his belief</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that a story in The Mail on Sunday about an alleged flirtation with a &#8216;plummy-voiced executive&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been obtained by voicemail hacking. Mr Grant accepted that he had no hard evidence to</span>
 <span style="font-size: 15px;">support this belief; it was an exercise in speculation (although it might otherwise be described</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as inference). The day after he had appeared before the Inquiry, on 22 November 2011, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Daily Mail published a piece which accused Mr Grant of making a &#8216;mendacious smear&#8217; against</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Mail titles. It is of value because it is a good example of the strategy of &#8216;defensive attack&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(although the Mail titles argue that the story was entirely justified) which itself represents a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strand within the culture of the press. It is also of interest since the relevant evidence grew</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out of the Inquiry&#8217;s proceedings themselves.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-15"><a href="#para1-15" name="para1-15">1.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">During the course of the Inquiry, Sebastian Bowles, an 11-year old schoolboy, was tragically</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">killed in a coach crash in Switzerland. Unfortunately, his family was subjected to insensitive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and intrusive press reporting which failed to respect their privacy and their grief. The evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given by the family solicitor, Giles Crown, chimed with evidence given during the course of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Module One of the Inquiry, more fully set out and footnoted below. Again, this has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">selected by the Inquiry as a case study because it is illustrative of a clear strand within the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">culture, practices and ethics of the press, as well as shining light on the effectiveness of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">PCC.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-16"><a href="#para1-16" name="para1-16">1.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The final Section of this Chapter deals with two significant stories which entered the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">domain after the formal Inquiry sessions concluded in July 2012. They relate to the private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lives of two members of the Royal Family, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intrusions in relation to Prince Harry, and the contrast with the approach to the story relating</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Duchess of Cambridge and the ramifications of both, form the basis of an important</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case study, illustrating as it does a series of generic issues surrounding the approach to clause</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">3 of the Editors&#8217; Code and the general provision relating to the public interest; the relevance</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of publication on the internet; and the overall response (or lack of it) of the Press Complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Commission (PCC).</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. The dowlers</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Bob and Sally Dowler fully appreciated that the disappearance of their daughter, Amanda,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">known as Milly, was a<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;massive</span><span style="font-style:italic"> news</span><span style="font-style:italic"> story&#8217;</span> . From the start, the press was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;like</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> double-edged</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sword&#8217;:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> as</span><span style="font-style:normal"> many</span><span style="font-style:normal"> have</span><span style="font-style:normal"> pointed</span><span style="font-style:normal"> out</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> similar</span><span style="font-style:normal"> vein,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> there</span><span style="font-style:normal"> is</span><span style="font-style:normal"> often</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span><span style="font-style:normal"> fine</span><span style="font-style:normal"> line</span><span style="font-style:normal"> between</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> need</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to engage the press to publicise a predicament or a cause, and the dangers of press intrusion.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As Mrs Dowler explained in her witness statement:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;What we did not appreciate was the extent to which the newspapers would intrude</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on our private turmoil and how little control we would have over where the lines were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">drawn in this respect. We did not have any experience in dealing with the media and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we have to make a lot of difficult choices, without the benefit of professional advice</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and at an extremely harrowing time in our lives. It felt like a lot of our decisions to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">engage the press had ramifications beyond those you could logically expect.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Dowlers gave examples of two types of media intrusion which, in the light of all the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other evidence the Inquiry was subsequently to receive, appear to be commonplace. First,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the months following Milly&#8217;s disappearance, Mr Dowler was frequently &#8216;door stepped&#8217; by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists and photographers looking for a story. In the words of Mrs Dowler:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></span>



 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;Bob would be in the front garden and a reporter would pop up asking a question</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about the case. In our experience, the journalists rarely started by introducing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">themselves. They would simply launch into a series of questions about Milly...&#8217;&#8217;</span>
<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, a particularly poignant piece of evidence concerns an occasion when the Dowlers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decided to walk home from Walton-on-Thames railway station following the route which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Milly habitually took. This was intended to be an intensely private moment. As Mrs Dowler</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained to the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;I met Bob and then we just basically quietly retraced her steps and no one was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">really around, so it was very much like the day she&#8217;d actually gone missing, and we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">put out missing leaflets with her photograph and a telephone number on, and that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">number had been changed, and I was checking the posters to see if the number &#8211; if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the right poster was up, and as I walked along, I was sort of touching the posters. And</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we walked back to our house, which is maybe three-quarters of a mile, something</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">like that, and that was on the Thursday, and then on the Sunday, that photograph</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">appeared in the News of the World and I can remember seeing it and I was really</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cross because we didn&#8217;t see anyone. They&#8217;d obviously taken the picture with some</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sort of telephoto lens. How on earth did they know we were doing that walk on that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">day? And it just felt like such an intrusion into a really, really private grief moment,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">really.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An article in the NoTW published on 12 May 2002 was headlined,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;The</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Longest</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Walk&#8217;</span> . The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">secondary headline was,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;Face</span><span style="font-style:italic"> etched</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span><span style="font-style:italic"> pain,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> missing</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Milly&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> mum</span><span style="font-style:italic"> softly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> touches</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> poster</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of her girl as she and her hubby retrace her last footsteps.&#8217;<span style="font-style:normal"> Although</span><span style="font-style:normal"> this</span><span style="font-style:normal"> doubtless</span><span style="font-style:normal"> made</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">story replete with human interest, it is difficult to argue with Mrs Dowler&#8217;s observation that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this was an unjustified intrusion into a moment of private grief. The very language of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">article indicates that the NoTW was well aware of the intrusion, but whether the editor or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sub-editor gave any thought to whether it might be justified is impossible to know at this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">distance. If he or she did, the judgment reached was misconceived.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One of the questions which the Dowlers asked themselves at the time was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;how</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> earth</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">did they know that we were doing that walk on that day?&#8217;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> There</span><span style="font-style:normal"> is</span><span style="font-style:normal"> no</span><span style="font-style:normal"> evidence</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> NoTW</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographers were carrying out day-to-day surveillance of the Dowlers on the off-chance;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had they been doing so, obvious ethical concerns would arise. Another possible inference (as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to which I make no finding) is that the NoTW discovered the Dowlers&#8217; likely whereabouts on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the day by listening to a phone message.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
The Dowlers also gave evidence as to the occasion on which Mrs Dowler gained access to Milly&#8217;s personal voicemail message, having previously only been able to hear the automated</span>
message. To the best of their recollection this occurred in April or May 2002 after a visit to the
Birdseye building at Walton-on-Thames in order to view some CCTV footage. As Mrs Dowler
told the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup>
&#8216;&#8216;we were sitting downstairs in reception and I rang her phone ... And it clicked through</span>
onto her voicemail, so I heard her voice, and it was just like &#8211; I jumped &#8211; &#8220;She&#8217;s picked





 
<hr/>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">up her voicemails, Bob, she&#8217;s alive&#8221;, and I just &#8211; it was then, really. Look, when we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were told about the hacking, that is the first thing I thought.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At the time Mrs Dowler managed to access her daughter&#8217;s voicemail it is clear from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence that emerged during the course of the criminal proceedings that Milly was already</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dead. The &#8216;false hope moment&#8217;, as it came to be described, was generated by the fact that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemails on the system were deleted, with the consequence that the automated message</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8211; signifying a full voicemail &#8211; was replaced by the personal voicemail greeting.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the article published on 4 July 2011 the Guardian&#8217;s account was along the lines that NoTW</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists, or someone acting on their behalf, were responsible for the deletion of these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">messages. However, the accuracy of this account was questioned in December 2011, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given its obvious importance the Inquiry sought further assistance from the Metropolitan</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Police Service (MPS) and Surrey Police who undertook a full investigation into what happened.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ultimately, in May 2012 the Inquiry received a witness statement from Detective Chief</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inspector John MacDonald, of the MPS, which was read into the record.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This evidence conclusively established that the Dowlers had visited the Birdseye building</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">shortly after 18:00hrs on 24 March 2002, which was three days after Milly&#8217;s disappearance.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The family liaison officer&#8217;s log records:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;At 19:10 hours Mr and Mrs Dowler were taken home by the FLO. Whilst at home,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mrs Dowler rang Milly&#8217;s mobile. The log records that Mrs Dowler &#8216;became distressed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as Milly&#8217;s voicemail was now on the recorded message whereas previously there was</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">a recorded message (automated).&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although call data subsequently established that the time of Mrs Dowler&#8217;s call was 18:32hrs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(ie over 30 minutes earlier than the FLO&#8217;s log record, which was completed after the event), it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is clear from all the available evidence that the &#8216;false hope moment&#8217; occurred during the early</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evening of 24 March 2002 and not in April or May as the Dowlers had originally believed. They</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are not to be criticised for this in any way, since at the time of giving their witness statement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they were being asked to recall traumatic events occurring nearly a decade beforehand.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCI MacDonald&#8217;s investigation revealed that Milly&#8217;s last call to her own voicemail was at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">17:07hrs on 20 March, and one of Milly&#8217;s friends called her voicemail at 19:46hrs on 21 March</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and left a message. This was almost certainly the tenth message left on Milly&#8217;s voicemail: at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this point, the mailbox was full, and a &#8216;generic&#8217; (ie automated) message was left. But, after</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">72 hours, messages began to be automatically deleted. In the words of DCI MacDonald:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;The phone provider has also confirmed that when the voicemail box was full the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">automated message would be heard, and once messages had started to drop off,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the personal voicemail greeting that Mrs Dowler heard would again have come into</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">effect.&#8217;&#8217;</span>



 <p id="para-id-2-12"><a href="#para2-12" name="para2-12">2.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Accordingly, the probable inference is that Mrs Dowler&#8217;s call was made shortly after one of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the previous messages was deleted &#8211; 72&#190; hours had elapsed between Milly&#8217;s friend&#8217;s call and</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Mrs Dowler&#8217;s.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are two additional pieces of evidence which fall to be considered, although on analysis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they do not bear on the genesis of the &#8216;false hope moment&#8217;. First, on 26 March 2002 there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was a voicemail platform migration by the service provider, Mercury one2one. That migration</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">included Milly&#8217;s voicemail. It would have had the effect of resetting Milly&#8217;s personal greeting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to an automated voicemail message, which would have remained as such until changed by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the owner of the phone. Yet this occurred two days after the key date for present purposes,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and could have had no impact on the false hope moment. Second, DCI MacDonald gave</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence that a message left on Milly&#8217;s voicemail at 14:10hrs on 26 March was shown as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a saved message when Surrey Police listened to it at 15:25hrs. The issue is complicated by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the fact that there were a number of technical matters being carried out on that day by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">service provider, but in the words of DCI MacDonald:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;It is not possible to state why the message left at 14:10 hours on 26 March was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">shown as a saved message when Surrey Police listened to it at 15:25. One possibility</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is that it was subject to an illegal intercept in that 75 minute period. However we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should also consider the lack of a complete set of call data for that time when trying</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to interpret what happened.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-14"><a href="#para2-14" name="para2-14">2.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is neither necessary nor appropriate for present purposes to delve further into these issues.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Unnecessary, because whatever happened on 26 March 2002 can have no logical bearing on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mrs Dowler&#8217;s state of mind two days earlier, and inappropriate, because the whole issue of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">possible illegal interception of Milly&#8217;s voicemails is now the subject of criminal proceedings.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is, however, appropriate to make reference to what was said on behalf of the Guardian</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper on 9 May 2012 immediately after DCI MacDonald&#8217;s evidence had been read:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;The Guardian story of 4 July 2011 was based on multiple sources and their state of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">knowledge at the time. Our error, as we acknowledged and corrected last December,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was to have written about the cause of the deletions as a fact rather than as the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">belief of several people involved in the case. We regret that. After five more months</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of intensive inquiry, the police have found that the passage of time and the loss</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of evidence means that &#8216;reaching a definitive conclusion is not and may never be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 13px;">possible.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It would be otiose for the Inquiry to comment on the Guardian&#8217;s expression of regret, which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">speaks for itself. Whereas it is true that a definitive conclusion is not possible on the existing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">state of the evidence, and may never be, the Inquiry does conclude on the lower standard</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of proof of the balance of probabilities that tampering with or illegal interception of Milly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dowler&#8217;s voicemail was not the cause of the &#8216;false hope moment&#8217;: this resulted from nothing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">less banal than the automatic deletion of messages in the ordinary course of the workings of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the system.</span>


 <p id="para-id-2-16"><a href="#para2-16" name="para2-16">2.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">But it remains worthwhile to underline that the essential gravamen of the Guardian&#8217;s original</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story of 4 July 2011, namely that Milly Dowler&#8217;s phone was hacked by or on the instructions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of journalists employed by the NoTW, was correct, and is now the subject of criminal charges.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-17"><a href="#para2-17" name="para2-17">2.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Surrey Police have submitted detailed evidence to the Inquiry and to the Culture, Media and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sport (CMS) Select Committee bearing on this issue.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup> This establishes that shortly before 13</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">April 2002 NoTW reporters listened to at least four voicemail messages left on Milly&#8217;s phone,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one of which (timed at 10:13hrs on 27 March 2002) they had transcribed as follows:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8216;&#8216;Hello Mandy. This is [REDACTED from [REDACTED] recruitment agency. We are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ringing because we are starting interviewing today at [REDACTED]. Call back on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">[REDACTED]. Thanks. Bye.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-18"><a href="#para2-18" name="para2-18">2.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The NoTW apparently deduced from this that Milly was still alive and using the name &#8216;Mandy&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to seek work in the area where the agency was based. The agency notified Mercia Police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it had received two telephone calls from a woman claiming to be Mrs Dowler (either a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hoaxer or a journalist) asking whether Milly was working for them. The agency gave out no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information to the caller, but on 13 April 2002 NoTW reporters attended at the premises of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the agency in search of further leads. At 12:10hrs on 13 April the joint owner of the agency</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contacted Surrey Police by telephone, stating:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;We have had a News of the World reporter... harassing us today. He says that our</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">agency has recruited Milly as an employee, demanding to know what we know and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">saying that he is working in full co-operation with the police.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-19"><a href="#para2-19" name="para2-19">2.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That last assertion was of course untrue. Surrey Police then contacted the NoTW which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">admitted that it had acquired its information from Milly&#8217;s phone (claiming to have obtained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the number and PIN from school children) and confirming that it had a recording of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail message.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-20"><a href="#para2-20" name="para2-20">2.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Later on 13 April the NoTW contacted Surrey Police claiming that it was confident of its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sources and that it was intending to print the information it had relayed to the police as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">news story. Despite police warnings that the message was probably the work of a hoaxer, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW went into print on Sunday 14 April 2002 with its angle on the story.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-21"><a href="#para2-21" name="para2-21">2.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is unnecessary for the Inquiry to investigate every aspect of this somewhat convoluted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sequence of events, which undoubtedly would have impacted on the police investigation in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">April 2002. Surrey Police carried out no arrests at the time, but detailed investigations have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been conducted pursuant to Operation Weeting. It is sufficient for present purposes to state</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the main thrust of the article published in the Guardian on 4 July 2011, that Milly Dowler&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail was hacked into by NoTW journalists, was correct. As the Dowlers explained in their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">witness statement, they received substantial compensation from News International (NI) to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mark the egregious conduct of their employees. Even if that conduct did not embrace causing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the &#8216;false hope moment&#8217;, its characterisation as egregious remains apposite.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-22"><a href="#para2-22" name="para2-22">2.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Guardian&#8217;s error in relation to the circumstances in which Milly&#8217;s voicemail messages</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were deleted was significant although, in the light of all the circumstances, had it been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">couched in more cautious or less certain terms may not have been capable of criticism at all.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It certainly did not justify the attack that followed: I am certainly not criticising it or the paper.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nor, as I pointed out on 4 December 2011, does the Guardian&#8217;s error in any way undermine</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">the reasons for setting up, or the work of, this Inquiry, despite what some have suggested.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The fact remains that the NoTW hacked the phone of a dead schoolgirl called Milly Dowler.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The revelation of that story rightly shocked the public conscience in a way that other stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of phone hacking may not have, but it also gave momentum to growing calls for light to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">shed on an unethical and unlawful practice of which there were literally thousands of victims.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In that context, whether or not NoTW journalists had caused the &#8220;false hope&#8221; moment is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">almost irrelevant.</span>

<h2>3. Kate and Gerry mcCann</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his submissions opening Module One of the Inquiry, David Sherborne, Counsel for the Core</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Participant Victims, described the press treatment of the McCanns as a &#8216;national scandal&#8217;:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not merely had they suffered the personal tragedy of the abduction of their daughter, they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were subjected to a barrage of press reporting which could only be fairly characterised as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">diatribe. Clearly, therefore, it is appropriate to take the experience of the McCanns as a &#8216;case</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">study&#8217; warranting further examination for the light it throws on the culture, practices and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethics of the press. Their case is also highly illuminating in the context of the action, or rather</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the inaction, of the PCC.</span>

<h3>The McCanns&#8217; personal perspective</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Madeleine McCann was abducted from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">3 May 2007, shortly before her fourth birthday. Her parents were dining with a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">friends at a tapas bar within the holiday complex and also within sight of the apartment</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">where she was sleeping, together with her younger twin siblings. As Dr Gerry McCann&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">witness statement makes clear, much has already been written about the details concerning</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Madeleine&#8217;s disappearance, and no one reading this Report is likely to be unaware of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">basic facts. These include the fact that the McCanns are still searching for their daughter. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terms of the chronology, however, it should be noted that on 7 September 2007 the McCanns</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were accorded the status of<span style="font-style:italic"> arguidos</span> (ie persons of specific interest to the investigation, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not a synonym for an accused) by the Portuguese<span style="font-style:italic"> Policia</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Judicaria</span> (PJ). This was somewhat of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a watershed in terms of the nature and quality of press reporting.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Just as the Dowlers had articulated the need to engage with the press in order to gain their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assistance and support, the McCanns explained that they had no option but to implement a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proactive press strategy: they were in a foreign jurisdiction, and time was of the essence in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this, as in all other, child abduction cases. Such were the pressures of press engagement that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was necessary at an early stage to enlist the full-time assistance of a press advisor, Clarence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mitchell; he had been seconded to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as part of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media liaison at this town. Dr McCann stressed to the Inquiry that the initial experiences of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dealing with the press were positive:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;I think for those people who can remember, it was a very unusual scenario, and we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">got a distinct impression that there was a genuine want to help attitude from the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalists there, and I think also many of the executives who perhaps saw what had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">happened to us and there was a huge amount of empathy. So I really did feel early on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">there was a desire to help.&#8217;&#8217;</span>


 <p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Unfortunately, these favourable impressions began to dissipate when the McCanns returned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">home from Portugal. Much has been said by other witnesses about press intrusion and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behaviour, in particular, of paparazzi; the experiences of the McCanns were no different. They</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had become a news item, a commodity, almost a piece of public property where the public&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">right to know possessed few, if any, boundaries. As Dr McCann explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;When we got back to our home in Rothley, again there were tens of journalists &#8211; we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">live in a cul de sac, at the end of it &#8211; camped outside our house, cameras, helicopter</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">crews following us. We were hemmed in the house for a couple of days before the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">police moved them to the end of our drive.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Then you tell us that photographers were still banging on car windows, even with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">one or more children in the car; is that right?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">MRS McCANN<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup> : And they stayed there until December 2007.That was only after we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had help to get them removed, but they were there every day, and they&#8217;d wait for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Gerry to go and they knew I&#8217;d have to come out of the house at some point with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the children. It would be the same photograph every day, we&#8217;d be in the car, myself</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and two children, the photographers would either spring out from behind a hedge to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">get a startled look that they could attach &#8220;fragile&#8221;, &#8220;furious&#8221;, whatever they wanted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to put with the headline, but there were several occasions where they would bang</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the windows, sometimes with the camera lenses, and Amelie said to me several</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">times, &#8220;Mummy, I&#8217;m scared.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In answer to the suggestion that the positive decision made by the McCanns to engage with</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press in order to serve their own interests effectively meant that they had waived their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rights to privacy and everything else, Dr McCann said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;Well, it has been argued on many occasions that by engaging then it was more or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">less open season, and I think it&#8217;s crass and insensitive to suggest that by engaging</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with a view to trying to find your daughter, that the press can write whatever they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">want about you without punishment.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr McCann was not of course suggesting that the press was obliged to write about him only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on his terms rather than on theirs. However, the point he was making was entirely valid; a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision to engage with the press does not make a private person public property for virtually</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all purposes, still less does it begin to justify defamatory reporting.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The protracted spate of defamatory reporting commenced in September 2007 and had to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be endured by the McCanns over four torrid months ending in January 2008. It only stopped</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">after the McCanns were driven to take legal action against the worst perpetrators. It is well</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">known that British newspapers were relying on reports in Portuguese journals and other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sources which were either associated with, close to, or directly part of the PJ. But, as the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">McCanns themselves explained, the British press often did not know the source; or did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">know whether it was accurate, exaggerated or downright untruthful; or (as the McCanns</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">believed) sometimes made up.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup></span>




 <p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of titles were guilty of gross libels of the McCanns and of serious and total failure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to apply anything approaching the standards to which each has said they aspire.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup> For that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reason, the nature of the errors perpetrated by certain sections of the press will be explored,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but at this stage it is sufficient to make the observation that, aside from the gross inaccuracy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the reporting in issue, some of it was, to put it bluntly, outrageous. One particular piece</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the Daily Star published on 26 November 2007 certainly justifies being so described and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr McCann was moved to go yet further:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;Q. &#8220;Maddie &#8216;sold&#8217; by hard-up McCanns.&#8221; This is the article you do refer to, the selling</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">into white slavery allegation. Probably you don&#8217;t want to dignify that with a comment?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. That&#8217;s nothing short of disgusting.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">MRS McCANN: I think this same journalist, if memory serves right, also said we stored</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">her body in a freezer. I mean, we just ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Just to make the comment, there&#8217;s absolutely no source for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">that assertion in the article.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In January 2008, letters before action were sent to a number of newspapers. The first</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">response came from Northern & Shell, on behalf of the Daily Express, on 7 February.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">According to Dr McCann, the Express rejected the complaint on the straightforward ground</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the McCanns were<span style="font-style:italic"> arguidos</span> , but the paper suggested that they do an interview with OK!</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">magazine; this was an offer which was rightly (and without any exaggeration) characterised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by Dr McCann as &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic"> rather</span><span style="font-style:italic"> breathtaking</span> &#8217;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-10"><a href="#para3-10" name="para3-10">3.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It did not take very long, however, for Northern & Shell to modify their position and, on</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">19 March 2008, a statement was read out in open court in which liability was admitted. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">settlement also involved the making of a substantial payment into the Madeleine fund and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the printing of an apology on the front page of the Daily Express and the Daily Star.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup> The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apology correctly pointed out that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> difficult</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> conceive</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> more</span><span style="font-style:italic"> serious</span><span style="font-style:italic"> allegation&#8217;</span> . It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also correctly recognised that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;there</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> no</span><span style="font-style:italic"> evidence</span><span style="font-style:italic"> whatsoever</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> suggest</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Mrs</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">McCann were responsible for the death of their daughter, they were involved in any cover up</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and there was no basis for Express Newspapers to allege otherwise&#8217;.<span style="font-style:normal"> Given</span><span style="font-style:normal"> this</span><span style="font-style:normal"> admission,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> it</span><span style="font-style:normal"> is</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">difficult to understand why the defamatory articles ever saw the light of day in the first place.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-11"><a href="#para3-11" name="para3-11">3.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It should also be mentioned that others involved at the periphery of the McCann tragedy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were the subject of defamatory reporting which led to substantial libel settlements.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Robert Murat was wrongly accused of being involved in some way in the abduction and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was traduced in the British press; and the friends of the McCanns who had dined with them</span>




 <span style="font-size: 15px;">on the evening of Madeleine&#8217;s abduction were falsely accused of being implicated in a cover</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">up.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-12"><a href="#para3-12" name="para3-12">3.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If ever there were an example of a story which ran totally out of control, this is one. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appetite for &#8216;news&#8217; became insatiable, and once the original story had run its course the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">desire to find new leads and &#8216;angles&#8217; began to take over, with their corollary tendencies</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of sensationalism and scandal. Not merely was the rigorous search for the truth the first</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principle to be sacrificed but also was any respect for the dignity, privacy and wellbeing of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the McCanns.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-13"><a href="#para3-13" name="para3-13">3.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sectionsofthepresshavesuggestedthatthiswasverymucha&#8216;oneoff&#8217;andscarcelyillustrative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of their culture, practices and ethics. But all the material evidenced below<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup> indicates that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this is not the case: although the treatment of the McCanns may very well be one of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">most egregious examples, the inquiry heard examples of similar practices from numerous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">witnesses. As paragraph 373 of the CMS Select Committee&#8217;s Second Report, dated 9 February</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010, makes clear:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The newspaper industry&#8217;s assertion that the McCann case is a one-off event shows</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that it is in denial about the scale and gravity of what went wrong, and about the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">need to learn from those mistakes.&#8221;</span>

<h3>The press perspective</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-14"><a href="#para3-14" name="para3-14">3.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry heard from two of the Daily Express journalists involved in reporting the McCann</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">story. No criticism is made or to be inferred of them, because it was not their decision to run</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the story generally or to publish any specific or individual pieces. For present purposes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is necessary to draw attention only to a short extract from the witness statement of one of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the journalists:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Although I was confident of the veracity of the reports I was writing, due to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">secrecy of justice laws they were impossible to prove, to any satisfactory legal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">standard, at that time...Due to the restrictions of the Portuguese law, anyone who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was unhappy about something that had been written or said about them and wished</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to take action would almost certainly have been successful. As a journalist this is a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wholly unsatisfactory position which, in my view, leaves news organisations at the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mercy of potential litigants. They simply are unable to defend themselves.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-15"><a href="#para3-15" name="para3-15">3.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The witness elaborated on this in oral evidence, and stated that he was certain that there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were conversations between the news desk and lawyers about this. He continued: &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was the situation we were in and there was no way round it&#8217;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> This</span><span style="font-style:normal"> reveals</span><span style="font-style:normal"> much</span><span style="font-style:normal"> about</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">culture, practices and ethics of the press. The journalist made it sound as if his newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was in the metaphorical cleft stick but, even on cursory analysis, this was not the case. There</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was no imperative to continue to report on the McCanns, still less to tell this particular story</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unless, of course, it is accepted that there was overwhelming pressure, both commercial and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">otherwise, to tell it. The news desk recognised that if the story were told on the basis of the</span>




 <span style="font-size: 15px;">unconfirmed reports coming out of Portugal, then<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;anyone</span><span style="font-style:italic"> who</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> unhappy&#8217;</span> would have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had a close to cast-iron claim.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-16"><a href="#para3-16" name="para3-16">3.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is of interest that the journalist could not bring himself to mention the McCanns by name;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they, after all, would be the prime candidates for being &#8216;unhappy&#8217; about the story. By then,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they had become almost depersonalised, a commodity. Further, the newspaper decided to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publish in the face of the concerns they had identified, placing themselves at<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> mercy</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">potential litigants&#8217;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Again,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> McCanns</span><span style="font-style:normal"> are</span><span style="font-style:normal"> not</span><span style="font-style:normal"> mentioned</span><span style="font-style:normal"> by</span><span style="font-style:normal"> name</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> newspaper</span><span style="font-style:normal"> is</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">close to being placed in the role of victim. As the journalist put it,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;they</span> [the newspaper]</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">simply are unable to defend themselves&#8217;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><span style="font-style:normal"> One</span><span style="font-style:normal"> might</span><span style="font-style:normal"> have</span><span style="font-style:normal"> thought</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> more</span><span style="font-style:normal"> sensible</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">response to this assessment, rather than bemoaning the apparent unfairness of being placed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in an impossible position, would have been the prudent course of not publishing stories which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not only could they not prove, but for which they had not a scintilla of evidence. Behind the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scenes briefings by police officers, themselves under pressure and constrained by Portuguese</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">law which were passed through third and fourth parties, could hardly be thought to constitute</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any, let alone a sound, basis for publishing such allegations as truth.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-17"><a href="#para3-17" name="para3-17">3.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These issues were taken up with the editor of the Daily Express at the relevant time, Peter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Hill. He frankly accepted that running the McCann story was very high risk,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup> given all the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">factors identified by his journalists. When asked to explain why he chose to publish in those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstances, Mr Hill explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;Because this was an unprecedented story that in my years of experience I can&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">remember the like. There was an enormous clamour for information and there was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enormous &#8211; there was an enormous push for information. It was an international</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">story, on an enormous scale, and there had not been a story involving individuals, as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">opposed to huge events, like that in my experience and it was not a story that you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could ignore and you simply had to try to cover it as best you could.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-18"><a href="#para3-18" name="para3-18">3.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">But &#8216;covering it as best you could&#8217; meant running a story in circumstances where there was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a high chance that it was untrue and, in any event, was utterly unprovable. Mr Hill accepted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the &#8216;very high risk&#8217;,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup> and felt driven to publish anyway, placing him and his paper in ethical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">difficulties in the context of clause 1 of the Editors&#8217; Code and legal difficulties with the law of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">defamation. His answer also betrays a curious form of logic: if, as was probable, the particular</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story was untrue, then it both could and should have been rejected. A different, truthful</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, by definition, better story should have been written based on the research that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists could undertake that generated facts that could be proved. &#8216;Covering it as best you</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could&#8217; did not mean throwing caution to the winds.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-19"><a href="#para3-19" name="para3-19">3.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hill was also asked whether the interests of the McCanns were taken into account. He was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adamant that they were:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;Of course. We published many, many, many, many stories of all kinds about the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">McCanns, many stories that were deeply sympathetic to them, some which were not&#8217;</span>




 <p id="para-id-3-20"><a href="#para3-20" name="para3-20">3.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Unfortunately, Mr Hill&#8217;s answer betrays a similar curious form of logic: the deeply sympathetic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories on this approach should be regarded as being capable of being weighed in the balance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in some way against the stories &#8216;which were not&#8217;, these being the stories which, as was put</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Mr Hill, accused the McCanns of killing their child. His answer to that proposition was that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the stories he ran were only repeating the accusations of the Portuguese police.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-21"><a href="#para3-21" name="para3-21">3.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The self same logic underpinned the evidence of the proprietor of Express Newspapers,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Richard Desmond, when he was asked about this topic. Mr Desmond said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;I&#8217;m not trying to win points here, because we did do wrong, but I could say there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were more, if there were 102 articles on the McCanns, there were 38 bad ones, then</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">one would say &#8211; and I&#8217;m not trying to justify, please, I&#8217;m not trying to justify anything,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but you could argue there were 65 or 70 good ones.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-22"><a href="#para3-22" name="para3-22">3.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Notwithstanding the language deployed, this was an attempt by Mr Desmond to expiate, or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the very least to mitigate, his company&#8217;s conduct, which simply fails to recognise that it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">completely misconceived.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup> It is additionally unfortunate that further questions revealed that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Desmond&#8217;s apology was not entirely unqualified:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;and once again I do apologise to the McCanns, you know, et cetera, et cetera, et</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cetera, but there are views on &#8211; there are views on the McCanns of what happened.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">And there are still views on the McCanns of what happened...What I think is free</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">speech is very important and if we get any more regulation &#8211; I mean, what are we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">trying to do in this country? Are we trying to kill the whole country with every bit of</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">legislation and every bit of nonsense?&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-23"><a href="#para3-23" name="para3-23">3.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This was another revealing answer, since by it Mr Desmond revealed what I consider to be a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very disturbing philosophical approach to the concepts of free speech and a free press. For</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">him, at the end of the day, the issue was all about free speech and the threat of excessive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation. On this approach, press standards and ethics were close to being irrelevant. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Desmond had made that clear towards the start of his evidence, when he disputed that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethical lines could be drawn.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref38" href="#footnote38">38</a></sup> Finally, it should be noted in this context that Mr Desmond</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was inclined to blame the PCC for failing to give his paper guidance<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref39" href="#footnote39">39</a></sup> rather than accept that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his editor should accept at least some responsibility.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-24"><a href="#para3-24" name="para3-24">3.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC should have done more, but Express Newspapers could not reasonably infer from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC&#8217;s inaction that their action was ethical. Mr Desmond, like his Finance Director Paul</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ashford,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup> also blamed the PCC for acting hypocritically by criticising Mr Hill after the event,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particularly in circumstances where Express Newspapers had behaved no differently from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">anyone else. There is merit in the argument that an even-handed regulator should have taken</span>







 <span style="font-size: 15px;">everyone to task and there is force in the point that criticism of the approach of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generally could and should have gone wider, but this is not an allegation of hypocrisy: the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC were not applauding the conduct of other titles while condemning the Express (which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">demonstrated the most egregious failings); they were simply using emotive language borne</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out of a degree of anger to condemn the Express and saying nothing about others.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-25"><a href="#para3-25" name="para3-25">3.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the other hand, the real point is that a regulator, acting in the interests of the public, while</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">respecting free speech, should have taken much firmer action in relation to the way in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this story was reported, even though the titles affected would have found unpalatable the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criticism that they should have faced. That the PCC did too little too late is not a complaint</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which it lies in Mr Desmond&#8217;s mouth to make.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-26"><a href="#para3-26" name="para3-26">3.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One of Mr Hill&#8217;s journalists had said in evidence that his editor was &#8216;obsessed&#8217; with the story.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hill rejected that description of his state of mind,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup> although in explaining his motives and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasons for persevering over so many months, his revealing answer was as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;I&#8217;ve already explained to you the basis for that decision, which had gone all the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">way back to my time on the Daily Star when I had realised that it was &#8211; that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">readers were more &#8211; the readers continued to be interested in the stories far longer</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">than the journalists, and it was my policy to continue the stories and I followed it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with many different stories. It started with Big Brother, it went on to Princess Diana,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">various other things, and that had always been my policy. It was nothing to do with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an obsession, it was more to do with a method of working.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-27"><a href="#para3-27" name="para3-27">3.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In other words, Mr Hill&#8217;s &#8216;method of working&#8217; tended to discern little or no difference between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;Big Brother&#8217; and the McCanns: this was all about similar commodities and what he believed</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">his readers were interested in. The obvious potential link between what Express readers were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apparently interested in and circulation figures was one which the Inquiry explored, but in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the end it was not possible to reach any firm conclusions. Mr Hill testified that he believed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that circulation went up as a result of the McCann stories and that this was a factor in his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">persisting with them.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup> He himself viewed the circulation figures and came to that empirical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusion. However, the Inquiry&#8217;s examination of the data did not disclose any clearly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discernible patterns.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-28"><a href="#para3-28" name="para3-28">3.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Overall the justifications advanced by Messrs Hill and Desmond for the frankly appalling</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">treatment of the McCanns were, as has been clearly demonstrated, both self-serving and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">without foundation.</span>

<h3>The PCC&#8217;s response</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-29"><a href="#para3-29" name="para3-29">3.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Two days after Madeleine&#8217;s disappearance, the PCC contacted the British Embassy in Lisbon</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and asked the consular service to inform the McCanns that the services of the PCC were</span>





 <span style="font-size: 15px;">available to them. Dr Gerry McCann&#8217;s evidence was that he was unaware of this until 2009</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when he gave evidence before the CMS Select Committee. He told that Committee that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not recall receiving such a message but, had he done so, it would have been lost in all the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other information the family was bombarded with at the time.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-30"><a href="#para3-30" name="para3-30">3.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr McCann accepted that the PCC had been extremely helpful in dealing with the unwanted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intrusionintotheprivacyof thetwins.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup> ThePCCintervenedtocontacteditorsandbroadcasters</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reminding them of the Code and, thus, not to take photographs or similar images of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">children; this practice stopped.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup> The PCC was also helpful in removing photographers from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">outside the McCanns&#8217; driveway, although this was only after<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;what</span><span style="font-style:italic"> we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> felt</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> long</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">period&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref49" href="#footnote49">49</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-31"><a href="#para3-31" name="para3-31">3.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A meeting took place between Dr McCann and Sir Christopher Meyer, former PCC Chairman,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on 13 July 2007. There is no dispute between them as to what was said. Sir Christopher&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence was that he explained to Dr McCann, at a time when there had only been one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complainttothePCCagainstanewspaperandthatwasnotproceededwith,thatheeffectively</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had a choice: either he could complain to the PCC, or he could take legal action, but he could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not pursue both courses simultaneously.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup> When asked what the PCC did for the McCanns</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">over the most distressing period, which was between September 2007 and January 2008, Sir</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Christopher said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">51</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;We were in pretty close contact with the press handlers of the McCanns. By that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">time, it was as gentleman called Clarence Mitchell, who I think may have appeared</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">before you, and we stood ready to intervene if they wanted it. We come again to the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">question of the first party. You see, you can&#8217;t be more royalist than the king on these</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">matters. You cannot wish to stop something more ardently than the first party. But by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that time, I think they had chosen to go to law. I can&#8217;t say exactly, because it&#8217;s not for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">me to say, when they first hired Carter Ruck. So it&#8217;s not as if we were sitting there...&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-32"><a href="#para3-32" name="para3-32">3.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This was a roundabout way of saying that the PCC did nothing. True, the PCC was on hand if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the McCanns had not decided to litigate, but they should not have been presented with such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a choice. Given the options which Sir Christopher had himself explained to Dr McCann, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given the scale of the defamatory treatment to which he and his wife had been subjected,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this was a classic case of Hobson&#8217;s choice. Further, as Dr McCann himself pointed out, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was invidious that he and his wife were being asked to contemplate bringing a complaint</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">against a body on which the editor of the Daily Express sat. A regulator of press standards,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">worthy of that name, would not have left the McCanns in such a predicament at the time of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their maximum distress. Either the McCanns should not have been presented with mutually</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">incompatible alternatives and given the option of pursuing both, or the PCC should have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;more</span><span style="font-style:italic"> royalist</span><span style="font-style:italic"> than</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> king&#8217;</span> (to quote Sir Christopher) and taken unilateral action.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-33"><a href="#para3-33" name="para3-33">3.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Christopher took the editor of the Daily Express to task for his conduct on the very day that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the McCanns&#8217; libel action was settled. This was too little, too late, and even after the facts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been conclusively established (by admission) the PCC took no formal action. As the CMS</span>






 <span style="font-size: 15px;">Select Committee correctly pointed out, and as will be discussed in more detail below,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref52" href="#footnote52">52</a></sup> the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC was empowered under its Articles of Association to launch an inquiry in the absence of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a complaint. The McCann case ought to have been visualised as a prime candidate for such a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">course of action.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-34"><a href="#para3-34" name="para3-34">3.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry cannot improve on the conclusions of the CMS Select Committee in February</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010 when reviewing the McCann case:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;374. In any other industry suffering such a collective breakdown &#8211; as for example</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the banking sector now &#8211; any regulator worth its salt would have instigated</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an enquiry. The press, indeed, would have been clamouring for it to do so. It is an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">indictment on the PCC&#8217;s record, that it signally failed to do so.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">375. The industry&#8217;s words and actions suggest a desire to bury the affair without</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">confronting its serious implications &#8211; a kind of avoidance which newspapers would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">criticise mercilessly, and rightly, if it occurred in any other part of society. The PCC, by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">failing to take firm action, let slip an opportunity to prevent or at least mitigate some</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the most damaging aspects of this episode, and in doing so lent credence to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">view that it lacks teeth and is slow to challenge the newspaper industry.&#8217;</span>
<h3>The Kate McCann Diaries</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-35"><a href="#para3-35" name="para3-35">3.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Kate McCann had kept a personal diary recording her innermost thoughts and feelings</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">following the disappearance of her daughter. It was intensely private, and she did not share</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its contents even with her husband. The diary was seized by the PJ in August 2007 pursuant</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to its investigations, but the Portuguese court ordered its return to Dr McCann, as well as the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">destruction of all copies in its possession. The PJ had translated the diary into Portuguese and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unfortunately one of the copies of the translated version found its way into the hands of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Portuguese journalist.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-36"><a href="#para3-36" name="para3-36">3.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A former NoTW journalist told the Inquiry how a copy of the diary was acquired by the paper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on payment of a substantial sum and then translated back into English. As Dr McCann pointed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out in her evidence, the re-translated text did not completely match the wording of the actual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">diaries, but this is a minor point when set against the scale of the violation to her privacy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which came to be perpetrated.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-37"><a href="#para3-37" name="para3-37">3.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The journalist&#8217;s understanding was that the news editor, Ian Edmondson, would<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;confirm</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the McCann press spokesperson that the diary was genuine&#8217;<span style="font-style:normal"> ,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> would</span><span style="font-style:normal"> obtain</span><span style="font-style:normal"> his</span><span style="font-style:normal"> consent</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publish extracts from the diary. However, his written and oral evidence about these matters</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was somewhat vague,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref54" href="#footnote54">54</a></sup> not because he was seeking to mislead the Inquiry in any way but for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasons which will soon become apparent.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-38"><a href="#para3-38" name="para3-38">3.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One piece of evidence given by the journalist was particularly revealing:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref55" href="#footnote55">55</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;But I think in terms of considering it being appropriate to publish Mrs McCann&#8217;s diary</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the obvious considerations over privacy, the view taken by senior executives was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that there were all sorts of false allegations being made about the McCanns and they</span>




 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">really were being pilloried in the press, that this account gave a true picture of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">McCanns and dispelled some of the lies being written about them&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In other words, the predominant consideration was not concerns about the McCanns&#8217; priva-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cy but rather the newspaper&#8217;s own evaluation that this was a sympathetic story which placed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them in a good light and was above all else true<span style="font-style:italic"> .</span> This is exactly the same sort of reasoning</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">process which the Inquiry has so often noted in its review of the critical material below.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref56" href="#footnote56">56</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-39"><a href="#para3-39" name="para3-39">3.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Colin Myler, the editor of the NoTW at the time, was asked about these matters. He had had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">previous dealings with the McCanns and had, for example, berated Dr Gerry McCann for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">doing an interview with Hello! Magazine in preference to the NoTW.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref57" href="#footnote57">57</a></sup> His version of events</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was that his news editor, Ian Edmondson, obtained consent to the publication of extracts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the diaries from Mr Mitchell:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref58" href="#footnote58">58</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;Q. But the obvious question, Mr Myler, is this: why did you not telephone either of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the McCanns and find out whether they consented?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Because Ian Edmondson had assured me on more than one occasion that Clarence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was aware of what we were intending to do and had said, &#8220;Good&#8221;. I think it was very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">clear from Mr Edmondson&#8217;s point of view how he&#8217;d spelt out what he was doing, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">indeed I stressed very clearly by using the phrase that I did not want Kate to come</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">out of church on Sunday morning and find that the diaries were there without her</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">knowledge.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. But you were of course aware that if Dr Kate McCann had not given her consent to</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the publication of this personal diary, she would be outraged by the publication. You</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were aware of that, weren&#8217;t you?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I wouldn&#8217;t have published if I&#8217;d thought that she hadn&#8217;t been made aware of it.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. And Mr Edmondson was telling you that he&#8217;d obtained consent on what day?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Well, it was absolutely clear from the Friday to the Saturday that that assurance</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had been given to him and given again to me.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. It was going to be a front page story, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-40"><a href="#para3-40" name="para3-40">3.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Edmondson&#8217;s account differed from Mr Myler&#8217;s. He explained that he tape-recorded his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">telephone conversation with Mr Mitchell without the latter&#8217;s knowledge in the interests of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;accuracy&#8217;, although he accepted that this entailed an element of misleading his interlocutor.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Edmondson was asked to state whether he made it clear to Mr Mitchell that it was the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intention of the NoTW to publish extracts from the diary verbatim. It is worth setting out his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">answer in full:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8216;&#8216;A. I didn&#8217;t make it clear.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. And you say because you were given express instructions by Mr Myler?</span>





 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Correct.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. When did he give you those instructions? Can you recall?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. From memory, at a meeting on Thursday of that week.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Why did he give you those instructions?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I attended a meeting with Mr Myler and Tom Crone where we discussed this story.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think we got the story to a point where I was prepared to present it to Tom and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Colin, the editor. Colin gave &#8211; sorry, I beg your pardon, Tom gave his legal view, which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I&#8217;m told I&#8217;m not allowed to repeat, but which dismayed, shall I say, Mr Myler. So he</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decided to ask me to make a call to Mr Mitchell, not make it clear what we had, tell</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">him in general terms, basically make it very woolly. I think someone previously used</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the word &#8220;ambiguous&#8221;, and that is absolutely spot on what he wanted.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. So the preferred outcome for the end point of the conversation with Mr Mitchell</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would be what?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. To give him the impression that we were running a story but not tell him specifically</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what story, certainly don&#8217;t tell him that we were in possession of the complete diaries,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as we understood. There had been extracts in the diaries &#8211; of the diaries in Portuguese</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">papers which had been translated into the English papers, but certainly not to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">extent that we had. He was frightened that if Clarence knew what we had, he might</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">take action.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Well, he would do &#8211; was the fear that he would, at the very least, tell his clients,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the McCanns, what was going on?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Correct.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. And they would certainly get back to Mr Myler by phone?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Correct.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Or make an application for an injunction to stop the News of the World publishing?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Is that what it amount to?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">A. That&#8217;s exactly what it would.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-41"><a href="#para3-41" name="para3-41">3.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This was devastating evidence. It would be remarkable if Mr Edmondson was seeking to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mislead the Inquiry regarding Mr Mitchell being given a &#8216;woolly&#8217; or an &#8216;ambiguous&#8217; account</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the newspaper&#8217;s intentions: it was a frank admission of unethical conduct and fits the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transcript of the conversation. Mr Edmondson&#8217;s version of events was not available when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Myler testified some eight weeks previously, but it has since been put to him for comment.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is inherently more probable that Mr Edmondson would have been acting on instructions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with regard to an issue of this nature rather than making the executive decision himself. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any event, the frankness and precision of his evidence on this issue, including his reference</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Tom Crone and legal advice, renders it more likely than not<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref61" href="#footnote61">61</a></sup> that his account is correct.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-42"><a href="#para3-42" name="para3-42">3.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Regardless of issues of individual responsibility, this case study is particularly illuminating</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for this reason. Read in isolation and out of context, it could be said that the transcript is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">somewhat ambiguous so that it could be deployed in support of a contention that, in some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way, Mr Mitchell consented on behalf of the McCanns to the publication of extracts from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">diaries. Thus, it was regarded by the paper as important to obtain written evidence which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could be used if necessary to justify what happened. Read in the context of Mr Edmondson&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explanation, however, the position is crystal clear. It is equally clear that deliberate decisions</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">were made within the NoTW to obtain this evidence by obfuscatory tactics and to deploy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to their advantage the fact that a conversation of sorts had occurred should the need</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subsequently arise. In the result, there was a letter before action, and the matter was settled</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">without the necessity of its ventilation in court.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-43"><a href="#para3-43" name="para3-43">3.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">But the impact on Dr Kate McCann in particular was traumatic. As Dr Gerry McCann explained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in his witness statement,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;Kate</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> distraught</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> morally</span><span style="font-style:italic"> raped.&#8217;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref62" href="#footnote62">62</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-44"><a href="#para3-44" name="para3-44">3.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">What the McCanns did not make explicit when giving their evidence, but was or ought to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been entirely obvious to any empathetic observer, is that the conduct of the press as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">highlighted in this section of the Report served only to magnify and compound their distress</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and upset consequent upon the abduction of their daughter.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-45"><a href="#para3-45" name="para3-45">3.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Overall, it is impossible to disagree with Professor Brian Cathcart, professor of journalism at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Kingston University, and his pithy and trenchant assessment:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref63" href="#footnote63">63</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I draw the analogy with, you know, other areas of life. If there&#8217;s a railway accident,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there is an inquiry and lessons are learned. In the press, I was very influenced by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">observing the McCann case develop over month after month after month like a slow</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">motion crash, and yet there was no introspection in the industry afterwards. The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">damages were paid, the books were closed, and they moved on. That is not &#8211; you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know, we wouldn&#8217;t accept in the railway industry or in, for example, a hospital, we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wouldn&#8217;t accept that nobody went back and assessed what had happened and tried</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to identify how things could be changed to prevent it happening again. So I think a</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mechanism &#8211; a regulator who is prepared to go in and do that is essential.&#8221;</span>

<h2>4. Christopher Jefferies</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Joanna Yeates was the tenant of Christopher Jefferies who owned a number of flats in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Clifton area of Bristol. Mr Jefferies is a retired English teacher, having enjoyed a long and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">distinguished career at Clifton College between 1967 and 2001. On 19 December 2010</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Yeates&#8217; partner, who had been away for the weekend, reported her as missing to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police. On Christmas Day her body was found at the edge of a quarry three miles away;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">she had been strangled to death. The Avon and Somerset Constabulary opened a large-scale</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">murder investigation and press interest in the story was, understandably, massive.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Unsurprisingly, given that he was the victim&#8217;s landlord, Mr Jefferies was invited to assist the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police with their inquiries, and he voluntarily provided two witness statements. Totally out of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">blue as far as he was concerned, at about 7am on 30 December 2010 Mr Jefferies was arrested</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by officers of Avon and Somerset Constabulary and then taken into custody for questioning. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lasted for three days, whereupon Mr Jefferies was released on police bail. On 22 January 2011</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Vincent Tabak was arrested on suspicion of murder, and he was formally charged the following</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">day. For reasons which it is unnecessary to address here, Mr Jefferies&#8217; bail conditions were not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">formally lifted until 4 March 2011. Tabak pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Ms Yeates on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">5 May and, as is well known, he was convicted of Ms Yeates&#8217; murder on 28 October 2011.</span>


 <h3>Press reporting while Christopher Jefferies was in custody</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">From the moment he was arrested on 30 December 2010, any publication in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Jefferies was subject to the &#8216;strict liability rule&#8217; set out in section 2(2) of the Contempt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Court Act 1981: in other words, it would be a contempt of court for any publication to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">create a substantial risk that the course of justice in the proceedings in question (commenced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the fact of the arrest) would be seriously impeded or prejudiced. This placed significant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">constraints on the nature and scope of subsequent press reporting. The issue was not simply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one of balance; a newspaper could be in contempt by virtue of publishing one prejudicial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">article, even if the same newspaper published many favourable ones. It is noteworthy that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on 31 December 2010 the Attorney General, having seen the first wave of reporting in certain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sections of the press, felt compelled to issue a public statement to editors warning them of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the need to comply with the 1981 Act. Additionally, there were the limitations imposed by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clause 1 of the Editors&#8217; Code and the general law of defamation.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The most damaging articles appeared in the press between 31 December 2010 and 2 January</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2011. Mr Jefferies&#8217; own characterisation of this material was that it amounted to a<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;frenzied</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">campaign to blacken my character&#8217;<span style="font-style:normal"> ,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> contained</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span> &#8216;wildest flights of fantasy&#8217;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><span style="font-style:normal"> As</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> put</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the matter in his witness statement:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref64" href="#footnote64">64</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;I can see now that, following my arrest, the national media shamelessly vilified me.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The UK press set about what can only be described as a witch-hunt. It was clear that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the tabloid press had decided that I was guilty of Ms Yeates&#8217; murder and seemed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">determined to persuade the public of my guilt... by publishing a series of very serious</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">allegations about me which were completely untrue, allegations which were a</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mixture of smear, innuendo and complete fiction. I have been told by friends and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">family that while I was in custody extraordinary efforts were made by the media to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contact anyone who may have had any knowledge about me, including friends from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">schooldays whom I had not seen for some considerable time, and former pupils. The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">tabloid press undertook what was quite simply gratuitous dirt-digging&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Jefferies gave evidence about what he called the<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;eight</span><span style="font-style:italic"> worst</span><span style="font-style:italic"> offending</span><span style="font-style:italic"> articles&#8217;</span> which were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">published in six separate newspapers over a three day period.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref65" href="#footnote65">65</a></sup> Three of these featured in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contempt of court proceedings brought by the Attorney General in July 2011, which was after it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been conclusively established that Mr Jefferies could not have been the killer. In the result,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News Group Newspapers (NGN) Ltd was fined &#163;18,000 in respect of an article published in The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sun on 1 January 2011, and Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) Ltd was fined &#163;50,000 in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to articles published in the Daily Mirror on 31 December 2010 and 1 January 2011 respectively.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is unnecessary to dwell on the language and tone of the &#8216;offending articles&#8217;. It is sufficient</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to draw on their characterisation by the Lord Chief Justice in the contempt proceedings. As</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the article published in The Sun on 1 January 2011, Lord Judge said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref66" href="#footnote66">66</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;The articles in the one issue of The Sun were written and laid out in such a way</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that they would have conveyed to the reader of the front page and the two inside</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pages over which the stories were spread that he was a stalker, with an obsession</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with death, who let himself into the flats of other occupants of the building where</span>



 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Miss Yeates lived, and that he had an unhealthy interest in blonde young women. ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Although the articles contain statements or words which could be said to have been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">favourable to Mr Jefferies, these were quite insufficient to counter the way in which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the spread of the articles, and their content, associated Mr Jefferies with this murder.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">These articles would have certainly justified an abuse of process argument, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">although their effect is not as grave as that of two series of articles contained in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mirror, the vilification of Mr Jefferies created a very serious risk that the preparation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of his defence would be damaged...&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-7"><a href="#para4-7" name="para4-7">4.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">And as for the articles published in the Daily Mirror on 31 December 2010 and 1 January</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2011, he went on:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref67" href="#footnote67">67</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;The material in the two publications of the Daily Mirror is extreme. True, it does not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">positively assert that Mr Jefferies was guilty of involvement in paedophile crimes,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or the unsolved murdered many years earlier. It is submitted that the articles were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">unflattering, suggesting that he was an eccentric loner. So they were. But they went</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">very much further. It was asserted, in effect directly, that his standard of behaviour,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">so far as sexual matters were concerned was unacceptable, and he was linked to both</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the paedophile offences and the much earlier murder offence. That indeed was the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">point of the articles. The juxtaposition of the photographs of two murdered women,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">together with the layout of the places where they died in proximity to Mr Jefferies</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">home, was stark. And in the context of the murder of Miss Yeates herself, the second</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">article implied that Mr Jefferies was in a particularly convenient position, as her</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">landlord, to have gained access to her premises to commit a murder, according to the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">article, committed by an intruder...&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-8"><a href="#para4-8" name="para4-8">4.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ultimately, Mr Jefferies successfully brought proceedings for defamation against eight</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref68" href="#footnote68">68</a></sup> in relation to allegations contained in 40 separate articles.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref69" href="#footnote69">69</a></sup> At the hearing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">before Mr Justice Tugendhat on 29 July 2011 when the libel settlements were announced,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Jefferies&#8217; solicitor said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref70" href="#footnote70">70</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;Christopher Jefferies is the latest victim of the regular witch hunts and character</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">assassination conduct by the worst elements of the British tabloid media. Many of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the stories published in these newspapers are designed to &#8216;monster&#8217; the individual, in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">flagrant disregard of his reputation, privacy and rights to a fair trial.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-9"><a href="#para4-9" name="para4-9">4.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Similar strictures had previously been made in a somewhat different tone, but with equivalent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accuracy, by Ms Yeates&#8217; partner, Greg Reardon, who issued a press statement on 1 January</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2011 in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref71" href="#footnote71">71</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;Jo&#8217;s life was cut short tragically but the finger pointing and character assassination</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by social and news media of as yet innocent men had been shameful. It has made</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">me lose a lot of faith in the morality of the British press and those who spend their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">time fixed to the internet in this modern age ... I hope in the future they will show a</span>





 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more sensitive and impartial view to those involved in such heartbreaking events and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">especially in the lead-up to potentially high-profile court cases.&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-10"><a href="#para4-10" name="para4-10">4.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">But, as Mr Jefferies has pointed out,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref72" href="#footnote72">72</a></sup> the majority of newspapers failed to print this section</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of his tribute, and those who did omitted critical wording, altering the meaning completely.</span>

<h3>The press perspective</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-11"><a href="#para4-11" name="para4-11">4.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry heard from two journalists involved in these stories, one employed by MGN and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the other by NGN, the publishers of the Daily Mirror and The Sun newspapers generally, as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">well as from those who played an editorial role. As with the McCanns, no criticism is made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or to be inferred of the journalists, because it was not their decision to run with the story</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generally or to publish any specific or individual pieces.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-12"><a href="#para4-12" name="para4-12">4.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is clear from their evidence that a number of former pupils of Mr Jefferies were approached</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by journalists to give their views of his character, personality and temperament. This in itself</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was a risky and unwise course of action; it could be treated as an opportunity for old scores</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be settled, and some may also have believed that there could be no smoke without fire. To</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their credit, not every pupil succumbed to these temptations. Whereas it is true that many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the articles written about Mr Jefferies included favourable material, the point made by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Lord Chief Justice in the contempt proceedings (namely that this was quite insufficient to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nullify the prejudicial impact of the disparaging material) is of course entirely valid; and in any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">event that which spoke of Mr Jefferies in positive terms did not do full justice to the quality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and weight of that material. Furthermore, evidence given by one of the journalists does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">altogether chime with evidence the Inquiry has already noted in relation to the McCanns:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref73" href="#footnote73">73</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;Well, obviously hindsight&#8217;s a wonderful thing, and looking back, we &#8211; everybody at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Daily Mirror is very regretful of the coverage and we do apologise to Mr Jefferies</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for vilifying him in such a way, but you have to understand at the time it was such a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">high profile murder investigation. There was huge public interest and concern over</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the tragic death of Joanna Yeates.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: I understand that. Actually, let me share this with you, Mr</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Parry: that&#8217;s one of my concerns, that everybody in retrospect will say, &#8220;Well, that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">clearly went too far and this clearly was wrong and that shouldn&#8217;t have happened</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and we&#8217;ll put in place mechanisms to try to prevent it in the future&#8221; &#8211; until the next</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enormous story comes along and it all just drains away.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I accept that, but I think you&#8217;ll find that this particular story was perhaps, you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know, a watershed moment for the industry. It wasn&#8217;t &#8211; an eye opener. It wasn&#8217;t just</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Daily Mirror. It was a number of newspapers who fell foul of this.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-13"><a href="#para4-13" name="para4-13">4.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is clearly a sense here of the story acquiring its own close to irresistible momentum and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">running out of control. The same sense emerges from other evidence the Inquiry received,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some of which is set out below.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-14"><a href="#para4-14" name="para4-14">4.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The duty editor at The Sun over the New Year period in 2010/2011 was Stephen Waring,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its current publishing director, the editor Dominic Mohan being on holiday. Mr Waring</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gave entirely frank evidence about his paper&#8217;s coverage of this story, and freely admitted</span>


 <span style="font-size: 15px;">his mistakes. He also volunteered the fact that he spoke to Mr Mohan about the coverage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the 1 January edition and that the latter said that he thought that the paper should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more balanced.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref74" href="#footnote74">74</a></sup> Mr Waring gave the following explanations as to how the story came to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">published in the way in which it did:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref75" href="#footnote75">75</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;... to me there are three elements to this. There&#8217;s the material we&#8217;d previously</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">published the day before, ie the first day of Mr Jefferies&#8217; arrest, and there was a lot of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">critical comment about his character from four unnamed pupils, ex-teachers, people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; former acquaintances, and that set a particular tone, which coloured my judgment</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wrongly, but that coloured the judgment. There was the nature of the story, which,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">just to put it in context, this story had been, as I say, on the front page for seven</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">previous editions, there was a general bafflement as to the motive for this appalling</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">murder, and Mr Jefferies&#8217; inconsistency, as it was perceived in his story the day before</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he was arrested seemed, wrongly, to be the great breakthrough, and this led to a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">great outpouring of adverse comment about his character ... But the key aspect of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this is the light in which this was legalled. I can&#8217;t speak for the lawyer&#8217;s own mind, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we are talking about an era where there was a far more liberal interpretation about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what we could get away with in print.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-15"><a href="#para4-15" name="para4-15">4.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This reference to what newspapers could &#8216;get away with in print&#8217;, which was Mr Waring&#8217;s own</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">choice of language, was a reference to the application of the contempt of court legislation by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Attorney General. However, as the Divisional Court in the contempt proceedings amply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made clear, the Attorney was merely applying the law as it had been set out and applied in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the relevant legislation. If previous holders of that office had been applying a more liberal</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">interpretation of the law, then newspapers were indeed &#8216;getting away with&#8217; more than they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should have done. In any event, this was not simply a question of contempt: it was a gross</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">libel. Nonetheless, this evidence chimed with other evidence heard by the Inquiry that, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">large parts of the press, the primary concerns of legal and managerial oversight are to avoid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">litigation: the fact that a particular story, or a particular method might have been unethical,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but legal, received little attention.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-16"><a href="#para4-16" name="para4-16">4.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It would be wrong to leave Mr Waring&#8217;s evidence without setting out his closing remark in</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">full:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref76" href="#footnote76">76</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;Could I just say one other thing? Please don&#8217;t judge my colleagues by the errors</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I&#8217;ve made in this edition, because they are a bunch of very committed, hard-working</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">individuals, the finest journalists in Fleet Street, and the Sun is a very vibrant paper</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that is a compassionate paper. We produce 100,000 items a year. We got this one</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">badly wrong and I admit that, but these mistakes do happen.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-17"><a href="#para4-17" name="para4-17">4.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Richard Wallace gave evidence about the Mr Jefferies&#8217; case in his capacity as editor of the Daily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mirror at the relevant time. As with Mr Waring, he frankly admitted that on this occasion his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper fell short of its own benchmark standards of fairness, justice and compassion,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref77" href="#footnote77">77</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that this was a<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> black</span><span style="font-style:italic"> mark</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span> [his]<span style="font-style:italic"> editing</span><span style="font-style:italic"> record&#8217;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref78" href="#footnote78">78</a></sup> Mr Wallace claimed that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Daily Mirror was acting on the faith of a number of off-the-record briefings from police</span>





 <span style="font-size: 15px;">officers,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref79" href="#footnote79">79</a></sup> the existence of which has been denied by the former Chief Constable of Avon and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Somerset Constabulary, Colin Port, in his witness statement to the Inquiry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref80" href="#footnote80">80</a></sup> The Inquiry is not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in a position to resolve this potential conflict of evidence, nor does it need to. The possibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the Daily Mirror was in receipt of unauthorised briefings as opposed to authorised, off-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the-record guidance has not been overlooked.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-18"><a href="#para4-18" name="para4-18">4.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Wallace was asked to consider whether there were broader reasons underlying the Daily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mirror&#8217;s error of judgment in this case. It is worthwhile setting out his answer in full:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref81" href="#footnote81">81</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;Q. So what was it that was driving you to take such a risky decision? Was it simply</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">such a big story that you couldn&#8217;t afford to ignore it?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. No, I made a very serious misjudgment.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. I&#8217;mtryingtoexplorewhatpressureswereonyou.Wasitbecauseofthecompetition</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with your rivals, who were also covering the story very extensively and in lurid terms?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Competition is always keen within Fleet Street. That has led us to have a very &#8211; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">continue to have a very vibrant press. The envy of the world, I might add. But &#8211; one</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">always wants to beat the competition, but one should not become reckless in seeking</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to beat your competition. How, in your view, would you learn from the mistake that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you made on this occasion to avoid something like this happening again?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I think Mr Jefferies&#8217; name will be imprinted on my brain forever more. It will change</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">very much the way I deal with any story of this nature in the future.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Apart from that, is there any practical change that could be made to reduce the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">risk of something like this happening again?</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I don&#8217;t believe so, because ultimately it&#8217;s down to the judgments of editors and,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you know, as I found in this regard and other mistakes have been highlighted, we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">all make mistakes. I&#8217;m not seeking to downplay those mistakes or dismiss them; I&#8217;m</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">just saying you can have as many safeguards and checks and balances in place as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you would like but these errors are going to happen. It&#8217;s about creating a climate,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I believe, which makes all editors think perhaps a little bit longer than they have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">previously.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-19"><a href="#para4-19" name="para4-19">4.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Putting to one side the concerns arising from Mr Wallace&#8217;s failure to identify any specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">changes that could be introduced to avoid such reporting in the future,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref82" href="#footnote82">82</a></sup> he was right to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">point out that editorial judgment will always be an important factor, and that mistakes will be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made, even in the most ethical of systems. However, the final point he made in this section</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of his evidence is deserving of greater emphasis. Mr Wallace referred to the creation of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;climate&#8217;; this Inquiry has throughout spoken in terms of creating a culture, and one of greater</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">respect for the rights of individuals and, as in Mr Jefferies&#8217; case, for the rule of law. The Daily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mirror believed that their story was accurate, otherwise they would not have published it. To</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggest otherwise would be to accuse the paper of malice, and there is simply no evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to support that allegation. It is possible to make the relevant point far more modestly in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this way: even if the story had not been defamatory, the Daily Mirror and other newspapers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should not have published it. Mr Wallace accepted that no editor should become reckless in</span>




 <span style="font-size: 15px;">seeking to beat the competition, and in this particular case he should also accept that he fell</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">short of that standard too.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-20"><a href="#para4-20" name="para4-20">4.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is worth making another point as well. Much has been said, quite rightly, about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exceptionally good reporting that comes out of the press in this country. That is not, however,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the point. What matters is the fact that poor decisions and serious lapses in the standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the press set for themselves are more than occasionally evident and few papers can say</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that they have never published a story that failed to meet the standards of the Editors&#8217; Code.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A regulatory system is there to uphold standards for all, however they normally behave; it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">needs to exist alongside any question of redress and whether or not the particular breach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gives rise to an actionable tort.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-21"><a href="#para4-21" name="para4-21">4.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Jefferies was the victim of a very serious injustice perpetrated by a significant section of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press. Without such reporting, it is hard to accept that he would have found it necessary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to change his appearance and effectively lodge with friends for approximately three months.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For those who have said that the Inquiry has been overly concerned with the complaints of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">celebrities, Mr Jefferies was not such an individual. Nor were the McCanns or the Dowlers.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Clearly, all of these witnesses would have wished for nothing more than to have remained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">well out of the public eye and off the front pages of newspapers but, for reasons beyond their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">control, that was not where they found themselves.</span>

<h2>5. The rt hon Gordon Brown mp and his son&#8217;s illness</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In November 2006 The Sun published private medical information about the son of the then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP. At the time of publication, Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Brown&#8217;s son was four months old, and the story reported his diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref83" href="#footnote83">83</a></sup> The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry heard extensive evidence in relation to this story and, because of the light it throws</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on a number of aspects of the culture, practices and ethics of the press, it is appropriate to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">address it in some detail. The factual disputes which arose during the course of the evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will only be resolved to the extent necessary to illuminate the culture of the press in general.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For example, there is considerable dispute between the then editor of The Sun, Rebekah</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Brooks and Mr Brown as to how the story was sourced in the first place. For a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasons which will be explained, it is simply not possible to resolve that dispute on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">available evidence, and it would have been difficult to do so even had the Inquiry decided</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to investigate the story in depth and require further evidence to be provided. What is not in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dispute is that there was no public interest in the story sufficient to justify publication without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the consent of Mr and Mrs Brown.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref84" href="#footnote84">84</a></sup> The medical information published by the newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was private information about a very young child and it therefore deserved the utmost</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protection. Prior to publication, only a small handful of doctors, other health workers and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">family members ought to have been, and the Browns would say were, aware of the diagnosis,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and it would have been obvious to anyone in possession of the information that it was highly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sensitive and not to be disclosed without consent.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-3"><a href="#para5-3" name="para5-3">5.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In July 2011, at the height of the phone hacking scandal, Mr Brown made further allegations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as to how The Sun might have obtained the material for the original 2006 story. The response</span>


 <span style="font-size: 15px;">of The Sun to those allegations shares similarities with the response of the Daily Mail to Hugh</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Grant&#8217;s evidence to the Inquiry, addressed at Section 6 below.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-4"><a href="#para5-4" name="para5-4">5.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, Mr Brown&#8217;s evidence to the Inquiry itself generated a hostile reaction in certain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sections of the press. That reaction, and the ultimate resolution of the issue to which it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">related, is discussed below.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-6"><a href="#para5-6" name="para5-6">5.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mrs Brooks was asked to explain this lack of specificity when she gave evidence. Her account</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref86" href="#footnote86">86</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;Q. How had he got the information?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. He&#8217;d got the information because his own child had cystic fibrosis and he&#8217;d got</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the information, I should say, through a very small &#8211; it&#8217;s not a small charity, but there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is a charity aspect to the Cystic Fibrosis Society, and he got it slightly by involvement</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">through there.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. What sort of involvement?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Mr Jay, I&#8217;m not going to tell you any more about the source because I don&#8217;t want</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to reveal his identity.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">Q. But you&#8217;re not.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Well, I feel uncomfortable answering that because I think it could lead to his</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">identity. You&#8217;re asking me where information came from and the source, and I think</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they are matters that I have to respect in a source coming to the newspaper. The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">main point of this issue is Mr Brown accused the Sun of hacking into his son&#8217;s medical</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">records to get this story and that wasn&#8217;t true.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: It wasn&#8217;t accurate?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">A. No, sorry, it wasn&#8217;t accurate.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-7"><a href="#para5-7" name="para5-7">5.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although the matter was pursued further with her, Mrs Brooks was adamant in her refusal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to breach the confidentiality of the source. Without knowing more of the background</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstances, and exactly how the source had apparently obtained the information from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the charity mentioned, the Inquiry is not in a position to judge whether Mrs Brooks&#8217; refusal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to answer further questions &#8211; on the ostensible basis that the source&#8217;s identity might be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disclosed &#8211; was justified or not. Further, the possibility that the source, (assuming he existed),</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obtained this information by unlawful or unethical means has not been overlooked, but here</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">again the Inquiry is in no position to make a finding.</span>


 <p id="para-id-5-8"><a href="#para5-8" name="para5-8">5.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Brown&#8217;s evidence was that The Sun&#8217;s account was incorrect, and that the information as to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hisson&#8217;smedicalconditionhadbeenobtainedincircumstancesofabreachofconfidentiality:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref87" href="#footnote87">87</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">&#8216;&#8216;In2006,theSunclaimedthattheyhadastoryfromamaninthestreetwhohappened</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">to be the father of someone who suffered from cystic fibrosis. I never believed that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could be correct. At best, he could only have been the middleman, because there were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">only a few people, medical people, who knew that our son had this condition. In fact,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for the first three months that our son was alive, I just have to say to you, we didn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know, because there were tests being done all the time to decide whether this was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">indeed his condition or not, and only by that time, just before the Sun appeared with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this information, had the medical experts told us that there was no other diagnosis</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that they could give than that this was the case. So only a few people knew this. I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have submitted to you a letter from Fife Health Board which makes &#8211; the National</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Health Service in Fife, that is &#8211; which makes it clear that they have apologised to us</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">because they now believe it highly likely that there was unauthorised information</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">given by a medical or working member of the NHS staff that allowed the Sun, in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">end, through this middleman, to publish this story. Now, whether medical information</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should ever be hounded out without the authorisation of a parent or of a doctor</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">through the willingness of a parent is one issue that I think it addressed, and I know</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Press Complaints Commission code is very clear, that there are only exceptional</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">circumstances in which a child&#8217;s &#8211; or information about a child should be broadcast,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and I don&#8217;t believe that this was one of them.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-9"><a href="#para5-9" name="para5-9">5.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Brown&#8217;s oral evidence contained an accurate summary of the contents of the letter from</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Fife NHS Board to which he referred.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref88" href="#footnote88">88</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-10"><a href="#para5-10" name="para5-10">5.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The written closing submissions lodged on behalf of Mrs Brooks urge the Inquiry not to reach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any finding of fact on the source of the story.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref89" href="#footnote89">89</a></sup> The points are made that not merely was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mrs Brooks entitled to refuse to disclose her source, but also that NI has other documentary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material in its possession which could throw light on the matter. I accede to Mrs Brooks&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">submissions, but not without a degree of reluctance. The letter from the Fife NHS Board does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not conclusively prove that Mrs Brooks&#8217; account is incorrect: full details of the investigations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it carried out are not provided, and the term &#8216;very likely&#8217; does not exclude other possibilities.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This case study illustrates precisely the sort of difficulties which arise as and when a journalist</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such as Mrs Brooks invokes the protection for sources vouchsafed by clause 14 of the Editors&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Code of Practice.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref90" href="#footnote90">90</a></sup> Further, it is one of the consequences of the very real protection that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">law rightly gives to journalists in relation to sources but it serves to underline the difficulty in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">holding the press to account (or allowing the press to vindicate itself) if there is a challenge to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the propriety of the way in which the information has been obtained. Mrs Brooks&#8217; evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Inquiry could well have been accurate; on the other hand, if it had been inaccurate, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">means of exploring and demonstrating that proposition is precluded by the terms of clause</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">14 if not the general law.</span>




 <h3>Consent for publication</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-11"><a href="#para5-11" name="para5-11">5.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Brown&#8217;s evidence to the Inquiry was that neither he nor his wife expressly consented to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication of the story. In his words:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref91" href="#footnote91">91</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Our press office was phoned by a journalist from the Sun and said that they had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this story about our son&#8217;s condition and they were going to publish it. I was then</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contacted. I was engaged in the pre-budget report. I immediately, of course, phoned</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my wife, Sarah, and we had to make a decision. If this was going to be published,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what should happen? We wanted to minimise the damage, to limit the impact of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this, and therefore we said that if this story was to be published, then we wanted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a statement that went to everyone that was an end to this, and there would be no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">further statements, no days and days and days of talking about the condition of our</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">son.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Unfortunately, this was unacceptable to the Sun newspaper. The editor phoned our</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press office and said that this was not the way that we should go about this, and to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be honest, if we continued to insist that we were going to make a general statement,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Sun wouldn&#8217;t, in future, give us any chance of advance information on any other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">story that they would do.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It was at that time that the editor of the Sun phoned my wife, whose aim then,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">having accepted that this was a fait accompli &#8211; there was no thought that the Press</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Complaints Commission could help us on this. I think we were in a different world</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">then. Nobody ever expected that the Press Complaints Commission would act to give</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">us any help on this, and we were presented with a fait accompli, I&#8217;m afraid. There</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was no question of us giving permission for this. There was no question of implicit or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">explicit permission.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I ask you: if any mother or any father was presented with a choice as to whether</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a four-month old son&#8217;s medical condition, your child&#8217;s medical condition, should be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">broadcast on the front page of a tabloid newspaper and you had a choice in this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">matter &#8211; I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any parent in the land would have made the choice that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we are told we made, to give explicit permission for that to happen. So there was no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">question ever of explicit permission.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-12"><a href="#para5-12" name="para5-12">5.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mrs Brooks&#8217; account was that the Browns, and Sarah Brown in particular, gave their consent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the publication of the story:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref92" href="#footnote92">92</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;A. I think in the period of time of receiving the information and publishing the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information, which is &#8211; which, by the way, went to all newspapers &#8211; all newspapers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">published it around the same day &#8211; I spoke to the Browns. I will have spoken probably</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to people around them but I definitely had more of a communication with Sarah</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Brown, as she was my friend, and I probably discussed it with her more. The sequence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of events were: Fraser Brown was born in July. I think the information came to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Sun in the late October. I think the Browns&#8217; position at the time was very much that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they had had the tests confirmed, and as Prime Minister and his wife, they felt that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there were many, many people in the UK whose children suffered with cystic fibrosis.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">They were absolutely committed to making this public and they were also &#8211; one of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the most overwhelming memories of that time for me was the Browns&#8217; insistence</span>


 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that when the story was published, that we absolutely highlighted the positives in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">association with the cystic fibrosis association.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. The story was published in November, when the child was four months old &#8211; I said</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">four years old; that&#8217;s incorrect &#8211; and before, I think, the diagnosis was confirmed. Is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that true?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. No. I think &#8211; and this is again from my conversations back in 2006 with the Browns</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and people who advised them &#8211; I&#8217;m pretty sure we ran the story in the November and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the tests were confirmed some time in the October.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. When you spoke to Mrs Brown &#8211; that&#8217;s your evidence,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mrs Brooks &#8211; was it on the basis that: &#8220;Look, we&#8217;ve got this story, we&#8217;re going to run</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with it, let&#8217;s see how we can run with it in a way which is least harmful to you&#8221;, or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">something like that?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Absolutely not, and I think that &#8211; as you&#8217;ve seen in my witness statement, I was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">quite friendly with Sarah Brown at the time. Very friendly. She&#8217;d been through a hell</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of a lot already. I think my first thing I would have said to both of them was &#8211; would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have been a much more considerate and caring response to hearing the news myself.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I was very &#8211; I was very sad for them. I didn&#8217;t know much about it and I wanted to find</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">out what had gone on.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">You havetorememberthat the &#8211; this is 2006. This is only fiveyears later thatMr Brown</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had ever said anything &#8211; that he was in any way concerned about my behaviour, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">behaviour of the Sun, how we handled it. Indeed, after 2006, I continued to see them</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">both regularly. They held a 40th birthday celebration party for me. They attended</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my wedding. I have many letters and kind notes. Sarah and I were good friends. And</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">so I felt &#8211; hence the story in the Sun in 2012 was quite tough &#8211; was that Mr Brown&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recollections of that time weren&#8217;t the same as my own.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-13"><a href="#para5-13" name="para5-13">5.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MrsBrooks&#8217;testimonyservestohighlighttwolacunaeintheevidencewhichrendersitdifficult</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the Inquiry fully to resolve the stark evidential dispute, or at the very least profound</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">differences of recollection, between these two witnesses. First, Mrs Brooks stated that other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers published the story &#8216;around the same day&#8217;. It is now clear that those other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers published the story on the basis of a press release sent out by the Browns the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">night before publication in The Sun. Although Mr Brown did not give evidence in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this press release, it appears (for reasons set out in more detail below) that the Browns issued</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press release once they realised that publication in The Sun was inevitable. Second, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry did not hear directly from Mrs Brown. To have required her to give evidence would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been a disproportionate step in all the circumstances, and the Inquiry cannot properly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">speculate as to what assistance, if any, she might have been able to give.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-14"><a href="#para5-14" name="para5-14">5.14</a></p>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">nature to be blazoned across the front page of a national newspaper. On the other hand, if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the complaint is well founded, the fact that the Browns appeared to have remained friendly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Mrs Brooks after November 2006 is itself somewhat surprising. Mr Brown&#8217;s explanation,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that his wife<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> one</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> most</span><span style="font-style:italic"> forgiving</span><span style="font-style:italic"> people</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> know&#8217;,</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref93" href="#footnote93">93</a></sup> may indeed be correct (and I do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not seek for one moment to challenge it), but, in these circumstances, she would have to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be. Interestingly, Mr Brown went on immediately to say that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> had</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> get</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> job</span></span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of doing what people expect a politician to do, to run a government&#8217;:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref94" href="#footnote94">94</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> this</span><span style="font-style:normal"> itself</span><span style="font-style:normal"> throws</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">much light on the relationship between the press and politicians, with its implication that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">imperative of continuing to &#8216;get on with&#8217; NI was abiding.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-15"><a href="#para5-15" name="para5-15">5.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is possible to reconcile this apparent conflict of evidence without concluding that any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">witness sought deliberately to mislead the Inquiry. Mr Brown&#8217;s evidence was assuredly right</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when he said that he and his wife felt that they were being presented with a<span style="font-style:italic"> fait</span><span style="font-style:italic"> accompli.</span> A</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalist, and not Mrs Brooks, had telephoned his press office with the news that The Sun</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was going to publish this story; or, putting the matter at its lowest, this was the inference</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which the press office drew. From their own previous experience or knowledge of the culture,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and ethics of the press, the Browns now perceived that this was now a matter of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">damage limitation, and they sought to come to an arrangement with The Sun on that basis.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Clearly, the Browns did not believe that they could persuade The Sun or its editor to take a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different course altogether, otherwise they would have tried to do so. Some of the detail of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Brown&#8217;s account could not be put to Mrs Brooks when she testified, because it simply was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not available at that stage. What is clear is that Mrs Brooks telephoned Mrs Brown and each</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">believed at the end of that conversation that a concordat had been reached: Mrs Brown,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because she had no option; and Mrs Brooks, because the Browns did not explicitly oppose</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the publication of the story.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-16"><a href="#para5-16" name="para5-16">5.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mrs Brooks is to be criticised in two interconnected respects, but only to the extent necessary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to address the culture, practices and ethics of the press. I do not find (as Mrs Brooks asserted)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the Browns were absolutely committed to making the fact of their four month old son&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">illness public, nor do I accept that their press release the night before publication evidences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that fact. However, it should be made clear that I am not thereby holding that Mrs Brooks</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">deliberately misled the Inquiry. Mrs Brown is highly unlikely to have said anything expressly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">along the lines that she was &#8220;absolutely committed&#8221; to making the fact of their son&#8217;s illness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public, and insofar as Mrs Brooks drew that inference from Mrs Brown&#8217;s acquiescence or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">failure to remonstrate, she is guilty of a degree of blinkeredness if not self persuasion. Had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">she stopped to place herself in Mrs Brown&#8217;s situation, she would have begun to understand</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the predicament in which she had been placed. In all the circumstances, Mrs Brooks should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have asked a series of direct questions of Mrs Brown to satisfy herself that consent was fully</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and freely given, and should have given her the express option of vetoing publication.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-17"><a href="#para5-17" name="para5-17">5.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the result, the Browns managed the revelation of the information via their own press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">release, the story was subsequently published in a way which placed the Brown family in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a sympathetic light, and The Sun had its front page. The Browns had been presented with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Hobson&#8217;s choice, and they took the line of least resistance. In that way they avoided both the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">risk of The Sun publishing an account to which they had not contributed, and the possible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political fallout with NI which might have ensued had they strenuously objected.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-18"><a href="#para5-18" name="para5-18">5.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The fact that Mrs Brooks might well not have published this story in The Sun had the Browns</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expressly asked her not to do so does not reflect badly on her, but speaks volumes for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">culture, practices and ethics of the press. In this particular instance, she held all the reins of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">power, and the Browns held none; to the extent that they felt that could not even ask Mrs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Brooks to back off.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-19"><a href="#para5-19" name="para5-19">5.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further, this form of<span style="font-style:italic"> fait</span><span style="font-style:italic"> accompli</span> is a familiar one to this Inquiry. The Brown&#8217;s evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strikes concordant notes with the evidence of witnesses such as Ms Diamond and the singer,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Charlotte Church, to name but two.</span>

 <h3>False smear</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-20"><a href="#para5-20" name="para5-20">5.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The article published in The Sun on 13 July 2011<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref95" href="#footnote95">95</a></sup> commenced with this sentence:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;The Sun today exposes the allegation that we hacked into Mr Brown&#8217;s medical</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">records as FALSE and a smear&#8217;.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-21"><a href="#para5-21" name="para5-21">5.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Unsurprisingly, given that similar language had been used by another newspaper in November</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2011 and this was still fresh in the Inquiry&#8217;s mind,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref96" href="#footnote96">96</a></sup> I pursued a line of questioning with Mrs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Brooks on this matter:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref97" href="#footnote97">97</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Now, my question. Would you look, please, at the first line</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the Sun article: &#8220;The Sun today exposes the allegation that we hacked into Gordon</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Brown&#8217;s family medical records as false and a smear.&#8221; My concern is whether it&#8217;s fair</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to describe that as &#8211; it may be incorrect, but as &#8220;false and a smear&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. In the general point, I can absolutely see what you&#8217;re saying, sir, is correct, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this was not &#8211; this was a particular journey that the Sun had been involved in since</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the beginning of the information coming into the Sun newsroom and what happened</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">after that and subsequent to that.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: But if he never knew how you got it, all you can say &#8211; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you&#8217;re entitled to say, &#8220;He&#8217;s just got it wrong.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. He came to the wrong assumption in 2011.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: And that&#8217;s absolutely fair. So the issue is whether it&#8217;s part</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the culture of the press that actually attack is the best form of defence. So people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">don&#8217;t just get it wrong; it&#8217;s &#8220;false&#8221;, in capitals, and &#8220;a smear&#8221;. Do you see the point</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I&#8217;m making?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I do see the point you&#8217;re making, but, sir, the context of that article was written</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">after Gordon Brown had &#8211; first of all, I think his first appearance in Parliament since</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he stepped down as Prime Minister was to come to the House and speak incredibly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">critically and, in some cases, made wrong assumptions through his testimony to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">House, and then the second thing he did, he then went on, I think, the BBC &#8211; I can&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">remember &#8211; to do an interview with another wrong assumption that the Sun had got</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the story from [the child&#8217;s] medical records, and I think combining the two, if you like,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">attacks from Mr Brown that had never ever been raised by him in any shape or form</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with any of us at News International or Mr Murdoch &#8211; he never once mentioned press</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ethics or practices in his &#8211; in our entire relationship &#8211; that the Sun felt that it was a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">smear, that he was doing it five years later for a particular reason, and I think that&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">why they wrote the story that they did. Now, I was chief executive at the time. I didn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">write the story but I&#8217;m defending their right to write the story like that.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: All right. You&#8217;ve provided an answer, but actually what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you&#8217;ve demonstrated is that the Sun believed &#8211; and they may be right or wrong, I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">don&#8217;t know &#8211; that Mr Brown had added two and two and two and got 27, whereas in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fact, if you took each one of the incidents on their own, it may have been he may have</span>



 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">made a mistake, he may be wrong to reach the conclusion &#8211; that&#8217;s all fair enough,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">entirely proper, but it goes a bit further than that.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I accept that this story does, but if you imagine for the Sun, the Sun &#8211; and I know I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">keep mentioning this, but the Sun has a trust with its readership.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-22"><a href="#para5-22" name="para5-22">5.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ultimately, the issue for Mrs Brooks was the reputation of The Sun in the eyes of its readers.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This struck another chord, in that in a different context (the pursuit of campaigns) Mrs Brooks</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stated that all that The Sun did was to reflect the viewpoint of its readers. In other words,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editors and journalists are mere reflectors of public opinion rather than the drivers of it, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the readers are always the pre-eminent concern. Mrs Brooks discountenanced the suggestion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that by criticising Mr Brown in this way the paper was unnecessarily raising the temperature</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and indulging in an exercise in &#8216;aggressive defence&#8217;; she could understand the point that was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being put to her, but could not begin to see the issue from Mr Brown&#8217;s perspective, instead</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">preferring to defend the paper&#8217;s right to publish this type of story.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-23"><a href="#para5-23" name="para5-23">5.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The parallels with the &#8216;mendacious smear&#8217; story<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref98" href="#footnote98">98</a></sup> and other evidence referred to below,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref99" href="#footnote99">99</a></sup> are</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">obvious.</span>

<h3>The aftermath of Mr Brown&#8217;s evidence to the Inquiry</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-24"><a href="#para5-24" name="para5-24">5.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 25 June 2012 Linklaters on behalf of NI wrote to the Inquiry drawing its attention to an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">article in The Sunday Post (a newspaper published in Dundee) on 17 June which stated:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;The Sunday Post heard about the baby&#8217;s condition weeks before they [sic] were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">published in The Sun. We contacted the Browns, and they told us that they did not</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">want to comment. We respected their privacy, and didn&#8217;t print the story. Remember</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that not all newspapers are the same.&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-25"><a href="#para5-25" name="para5-25">5.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rather than draw attention to the way in which The Sunday Post sought to distance itself</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the conduct of The Sun newspaper, as well as to the fact that the Brown family&#8217;s &#8216;no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">comment&#8217;ishardlyconsistentwithMrsBrooks&#8217;evidencethattheywereabsolutelycommitted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to broadcasting their son&#8217;s condition, the point Linklaters made was that Mr Brown&#8217;s evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the effect that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;there</span><span style="font-style:italic"> were</span><span style="font-style:italic"> only</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> few</span><span style="font-style:italic"> people,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> medical</span><span style="font-style:italic"> people,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> who</span><span style="font-style:italic"> knew</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> our</span><span style="font-style:italic"> son</span><span style="font-style:italic"> had</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this condition&#8217;<span style="font-style:normal"> must</span><span style="font-style:normal"> be</span><span style="font-style:normal"> incorrect.</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Linklaters</span><span style="font-style:normal"> asked</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Inquiry</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> obtain</span><span style="font-style:normal"> further</span><span style="font-style:normal"> evidence</span><span style="font-style:normal"> from</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Sunday Post and Mr Brown relating to this issue.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-26"><a href="#para5-26" name="para5-26">5.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 28 June 2012 The Times published a short piece which reported on Linklaters&#8217; request to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry, and referred to Mr Brown&#8217;s claim that The Sun had &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic"> illegally</span><span style="font-style:italic"> obtained</span><span style="font-style:italic"> information</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">from his son&#8217;s medical records&#8217;.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-27"><a href="#para5-27" name="para5-27">5.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, on Wednesday 2 July The Times felt constrained to publish an apology in these</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">terms:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;The Sunday Post has now explained it did not know that the baby had, or was being</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">tested for, cystic fibrosis. And we accept that Mr Brown&#8217;s evidence to the Leveson</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Inquiry was not as we described it: he told the Inquiry that he had been told by the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Fife Health Board it was &#8216;highly likely&#8217; that the information about his son&#8217;s condition</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">originated from an NHS staff member. We are happy to clarify the position and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">apologise to the Brown family.&#8217;</span>


 <p id="para-id-5-28"><a href="#para5-28" name="para5-28">5.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although the Inquiry accepts the explanation given in the third witness statement of Pia</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sarma, editorial legal director at the Times Newspapers Limited, dated 3 September 2012</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that facts set out in the article in The Times dated 28 June 2012 were themselves obtained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from information supplied by The Sunday Post, it is clear that the author of that article had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">misread Mr Brown&#8217;s evidence to this Inquiry. Others have suggested that on this occasion The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Times demonstrated a lack of objectivity borne out of its desire to protect another NI title: this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is certainly a possible inference, but would require more specific evidence to substantiate.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-29"><a href="#para5-29" name="para5-29">5.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Considering the episode as a whole, the treatment of Mr and Mrs Brown by NI left much to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be desired. It cannot be equated with the treatment experienced by the McCanns, Dowlers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or Mr Jefferies, but, as a whole, the experience of the Browns provides a fine example of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a number of aspects of unsatisfactory and/or unethical press practices further examined</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">below.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref100" href="#footnote100">100</a></sup></span>

<h2>6. Hugh Grant and &#8216;the mendacious smear&#8217;</h2>

<p id="para-id-6-1"><a href="#para6-1" name="para6-1">6.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Hugh Grant was one of the first witnesses to give evidence before the Inquiry in November</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2011. At paragraph 11 of his first witness statement he referred to an article published in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Mail on Sunday on 18 February 2007.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref101" href="#footnote101">101</a></sup> The article speculated that the cause of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breakdown of Mr Grant&#8217;s long term relationship with Jemima Khan was a series of late-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">night phone calls with a &#8216;glamorous young Cambridge-educated film executive from Warner</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Brothers&#8217; with a &#8216;plummy-voice&#8217;. The article continued:</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;a source revealed last night...Hugh was always disappearing for meetings and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whenever he was on the phone to this woman, Jemima would hear her plummy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">laughter. She would always call Hugh on his mobile, but Hugh would tell Jemima the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">woman was calling to discuss the movie. Then he&#8217;d switch his phone off. Jemima has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been very upset about it...&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-2"><a href="#para6-2" name="para6-2">6.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This article was defamatory of Mr Grant, and he successfully brought proceedings for libel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">against the publishers. According to his first witness statement,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref102" href="#footnote102">102</a></sup> the woman in question was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an assistant to an executive at a film company associated with Warners. She was middle-aged,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">happily married, and never had been a girlfriend of Mr Grant. She left voicemail messages on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Grant&#8217;s phone, and these were<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;plummy-voiced</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> sometimes</span><span style="font-style:italic"> jokey&#8217;</span> .</span>

<p id="para-id-6-3"><a href="#para6-3" name="para6-3">6.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Grant had not suggested in the libel action that Associated Newspapers Ltd (ANL) may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have hacked into his mobile phone. At that stage his only concern was likely to have been his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cause of action in the tort of defamation, and, in 2007, the issue of phone hacking had not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">achieved the level of prominence that it was subsequently to acquire. Paragraph 11 of Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Grant&#8217;s first witness statement concluded with this sentence:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref103" href="#footnote103">103</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;We know from Paul Dacre&#8217;s assertions that the Mail papers have never based stories</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on intercepted phone messages, so the source of the story remains a great mystery&#8217;</span>




 <p id="para-id-6-4"><a href="#para6-4" name="para6-4">6.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although Mr Grant was of course not directly accusing the Mail papers of hacking into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his phone, that he was lightly hinting at such a possibility was not lost on the Inquiry. It is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">worthwhile setting out the relevant part of Mr Grant&#8217;s oral evidence in full:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref104" href="#footnote104">104</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;Q. Are you suggesting there that the story must have come from phone hacking?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Well, what I say in this paragraph is that the Mail on Sunday ran an article in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">February 2007 saying that my relationship with my then girlfriend, Jemima Khan, was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the rocks because of my persistent late-night flirtatious phonecalls with a plummy-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">voiced studio executive from Warner Brothers, and it was a bizarre story, completely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">untrue, that I sued for libel over and won and damages were awarded, a statement</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was made in open court. But thinking about how they could possibly come up with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">such a bizarre left-field story, I realised that although there was no plummy-voiced</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">studio executive from Warner Brothers with whom I&#8217;d had any kind of relationship,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">flirtatious or otherwise, there was a great friend of mine in Los Angeles who runs a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">production company which is associated with Warner Brothers and whose assistant</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is a charming married middle-aged lady, English, who, as happens in Hollywood, is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the person who rings you. The executive never rings you. It&#8217;s always their assistant:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Hi, we have Jack Bealy(?) on the phone for you.&#8221; And this is what she used to do.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">She used to call and she used to leave messages and because she was a nice English</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">girl in LA, sometimes when we spoke, we&#8217;d have a chat about English stuff, Marmite</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or whatever. So she would leave charming, jokey messages saying, &#8220;Please call this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">studio executive back&#8221;, and she has a voice that could only be described as plummy.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So I cannot for the life of me think of any conceivable source for this story in the Mail</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on Sunday except those voice messages on my mobile telephone.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. You haven&#8217;t alleged that before, have you, in the public domain?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. No, but when I was preparing this statement and going through all my old trials</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and tribulations with the press, I looked at that one again and thought that is weird,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and then the penny dropped.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. I think the highest it can be put is, frankly, it&#8217;s a piece of speculation on your part,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">isn&#8217;t it, in relation to this?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes, you could &#8211; yes, speculation, okay, but I would love to know &#8211; I mean, I think</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mr Caplan, who represents Associated, was saying earlier today that he&#8217;d like to put</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in a supplementary statement and &#8211; you know, referring to the things I say today.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Well, I&#8217;d love to hear what the Daily Mail&#8217;s or the Sunday Mail&#8217;s explanation for that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">article is, what that source was, if it wasn&#8217;t phone hacking.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-5"><a href="#para6-5" name="para6-5">6.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Taking Mr Grant&#8217;s evidence as a whole, it is reasonable to conclude that he freely accepted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Counsel&#8217;s suggestion that he was speculating as to the source of the article, yet was seeking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an explanation from ANL as to the circumstances in which the article came to be published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the Mail on Sunday. This conclusion is entirely supported by paragraph 17 of Mr Grant&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">second supplementary witness statement, where he said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref105" href="#footnote105">105</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;Nevertheless I accepted entirely that this was of course speculation on my part as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">only the newspaper has the documents or evidence on which the story was prepared.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I never saw any in the legal proceedings.&#8217;</span>


 <p id="para-id-6-6"><a href="#para6-6" name="para6-6">6.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Grant&#8217;s evidence attracted a lot of media publicity, not least because he had covered a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">range of issues and this has been the first day of the evidence sessions of the Inquiry. Paul</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dacre, the editor-in-chief of all the ANL titles and the editor of the Daily Mail, heard a report</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Mr Grant&#8217;s evidence on the 16:00hrs radio news. Again, it is worthwhile setting out the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whole of the relevant section of his oral evidence to the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref106" href="#footnote106">106</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8216;A. Can I explain the circumstances of that? I was off that day on an outside</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">appointment. Not off; out of the office on an outside appointment, and I was driving</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">back and the 4 o&#8217;clock news came on the BBC and the headline was as followed:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Another major newspaper group has been dragged into the phone hacking scandal.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Actor Hugh Grant has accused the Mail on Sunday &#8211; Associated Newspapers&#8217; Mail on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Sunday of hacking phones.&#8221; It was a terrible smear on a company I love. We had to do</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">something about it. I discussed with the Mail on Sunday&#8217;s editor what our response</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was. A long convoluted press statement was being prepared. I was deeply aware</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; and he was deeply aware &#8211; that you had to rebut such a damaging, damaging</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">allegation, and we agreed on the form of words: &#8220;It was a mendacious smear.&#8221; Let me</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">explain why I feel it was a mendacious smear. You will have read &#8211; you have already</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interviewed our legal director on this for a considerable amount of time. Our witness</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">statements have made clear that Associated is not involved in phone hacking and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we&#8217;ve denied phone hacking in this instance, anyway, specifically.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-7"><a href="#para6-7" name="para6-7">6.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The &#8216;form of words&#8217; which Mr Dacre was referring to appeared on page 11 of the Daily Mail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">published on the day after Mr Grant testified, that is to say on 22 November 2011. It read:</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;The Mail on Sunday utterly refutes Hugh Grant&#8217;s claim that they got any story as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a result of phone hacking. In fact, in the case of the story Mr Grant refers to, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information came from a freelance journalist who had been told by a source who was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regularly speaking to Jemima Khan. Mr Grant&#8217;s allegations are mendacious smears</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">driven by his hatred of the media.&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-8"><a href="#para6-8" name="para6-8">6.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry is only concerned for present purposes with the final sentence of this extract from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Daily Mail and the reference to &#8216;mendacious smears&#8217;. Unsurprisingly, the protagonists to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this dispute were concerned to seek to persuade the Inquiry to investigate whether or not Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Grant had been the victim of voicemail hacking. Dealing with the rebuttal, Mr Grant submitted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a witness statement from Ms Khan which emphatically contradicted the suggestion that she</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been speaking to a source: she said that the first she knew any &#8220;plummy-voiced&#8221; woman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">calling Mr Grant, or anything similar, was when she read it in the Mail on Sunday.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref107" href="#footnote107">107</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-9"><a href="#para6-9" name="para6-9">6.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ANL, on the other hand, placed before the Inquiry material which sought to indicate that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Grant&#8217;s speculations were both illogical and without evidential basis.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref108" href="#footnote108">108</a></sup> Although the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">tested Liz Hartley, the head of editorial legal services at ANL, on her supplemental statement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and permitted some limited cross examination of Mr Dacre by Mr Sherborne, it is unnecessary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for this evidence to be analysed in this Report. For reasons discussed below, I do not accept</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the propositions advanced by ANL but it is very important also to make it clear that neither do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I conclude that the Mail on Sunday or any journalist employed by it knowingly used material</span>



 <span style="font-size: 15px;">for this story which had been sourced by phone hacking: equally to be fair, Mr Sherborne on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behalf of Mr Grant did not contend that I should.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-10"><a href="#para6-10" name="para6-10">6.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Given the specific nature of the Inquiry&#8217;s concern, further questions were asked of Mr Dacre</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in order to establish whether he knew exactly what Mr Grant had claimed in evidence before</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Mail&#8217;s rebuttal went out. Mr Dacre said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref109" href="#footnote109">109</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8216;&#8216;LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: But did you ask precisely what Mr Grant had said?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes, of course. I had that because I was in liaison with the office.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: So you knew that the headline did not reflect what he&#8217;d said?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes, but that &#8211; the damage was being done and I&#8217;m glad to say that once we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">got our statement out, we had a much, much more balanced reporting of it by the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">BBC and other media. But if that had been allowed to stand, it would have been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">devastating for our reputation.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">MR JAY: I just wonder, Mr Dacre, whether you didn&#8217;t shoot from the hip a little but too</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fast on this occasion.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Not at all. It needed rebutting instantly. This is how modern communications work.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It is my view that Mr Grant made that statement on the opening day of the court</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; Hacked Off, the organisation backed by the Media Standards Trust, attempted to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hijack your Inquiry with that highly calculated attempt to wound my company, and I -</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. I&#8217;m not altogether clear, Mr Dacre, whether you&#8217;re saying that Mr Grant perjured</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">himself. That&#8217;s what &#8220;mendacious smears&#8221; might suggest.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I&#8217;m not going to go into that area. I&#8217;ve tried to tell you the context of why we had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to rebut this. I mean, let me say as clearly and as slowly as I can: I have never placed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a story in the Daily Mail as a result of phone hacking that I knew came from phone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hacking. I know of no cases of phone hacking. Having conducted a major internal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enquiry, I&#8217;m as confident as I can be that there&#8217;s no phone hacking on the Daily Mail.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I don&#8217;t make that statement lightly, and no editor, the editor of the Guardian or the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Independent, could say otherwise. I&#8217;m prepared to make this &#8211; I will withdraw that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">statement if Mr Grant withdraws his statements that the Daily Mail and the Mail on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Sunday were involved in phone hacking.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m in a position to broker a deal between you, but can I just ask this,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mr Dacre: why didn&#8217;t you come back, as it were, in the measured way you&#8217;re coming</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to this Inquiry and then just say &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I&#8217;ve tried to explain &#8211; sorry.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. And then say at the end:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In the circumstances, Mr Grant is incorrect.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Because then it would have been too late.&#8217;&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-11"><a href="#para6-11" name="para6-11">6.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As I have already indicated, I make it clear that I accept Mr Dacre&#8217;s evidence that he never</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">placed a story in the Daily Mail (or permitted one to be placed) which he knew came from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">phone hacking. That said, he did not engage with Counsel&#8217;s question that the use of the term</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;mendacious smears&#8217; might amount to an allegation that Mr Grant had committed perjury.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The various written submissions of ANL maintained that the adjective &#8216;mendacious&#8217; possesses</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">a number of possible meanings, and argued that the term taken in context and properly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understood in law amounts to nothing more than &#8216;honest comment&#8217;. In my judgment,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">however, reading the article in the manner in which I have been invited, the Daily Mail was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accusing Mr Grant of lying. Mr Grant would only be lying if, in speculating as he did, he did</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not believe that his evidence had any foundation.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-12"><a href="#para6-12" name="para6-12">6.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, equally in my judgment, in making that accusation the Daily Mail was increasing the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">temperature and went too far. The &#8216;plummy-voiced&#8217; executive, apart from apparently being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">young, glamorous and Cambridge educated, was described in the article in the Mail on Sunday</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in particular by reference to the quality of her voice, as apparently discerned by someone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hearing it on Mr Grant&#8217;s mobile phone. Mr Grant knew that a lady with a voice which could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasonably be described in this way had left voicemail messages. From his own perspective,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he also knew that the claim made in the article that he discussed this lady&#8217;s phone calls with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Khan was incorrect (at the time he gave his evidence, he did not have Ms Khan&#8217;s witness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statement which further contradicted one important evidential plank on which the article was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">founded). He also knew that the lady in question was, with respect to her, middle aged rather</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than &#8216;young&#8217;, and he might well have believed that the references to her glamour and being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cambridge educated were poetic licence on the part of the newspaper. It follows, viewing the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matter solely from Mr Grant&#8217;s perspective, that there was some basis for his concern (which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in answer to a leading question he accepted was speculation) that an individual had listened</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the contents of his voicemails. This person was, of course, not necessarily the &#8216;source&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">referred to in the article, but could equally easily have been someone who had spoken to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">source about the story without identifying how the information became available.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-13"><a href="#para6-13" name="para6-13">6.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Dacre accepted that his principal objective shortly after 16:00hrs on 21 November</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2011 was to get out a strongly worded denial which would safeguard the reputation of his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers. However, in so doing he acted precipitately, in particular in failing to ascertain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exactly what Mr Grant had said when he testified. His explanation that further inquiry along</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those lines would have meant that the response of the Mail titles would have been &#8216;too late&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does not justify the aggressive line which was adopted in defence of its position. A response</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which defended the Mail&#8217;s position in regard to phone hacking and stating words to the effect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that Mr Grant&#8217;s speculation was just wrong, while robustly defending the Mail&#8217;s position,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would have achieved the same outcome without the accusation of perjury.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-14"><a href="#para6-14" name="para6-14">6.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of course, Mr Dacre was perfectly entitled to decide what he wanted to put in the paper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for which he had ultimate editorial control. He is entitled to challenge my view (as he has in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">robust and trenchant terms). As far as I am concerned, however, the point of this case study</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is that it is a good example of the phenomenon of &#8216;aggressive defence&#8217; identified above.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref110" href="#footnote110">110</a></sup></span>

<h2>7. Sebastian Bowles</h2>
<h3>The accident</h3>

<p id="para-id-7-1"><a href="#para7-1" name="para7-1">7.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At 21:15hrs on Tuesday 13 March 2012, a road traffic accident occurred in a motorway tunnel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">near Sierre, Switzerland, when a coach returning school children from a skiing trip to their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">homes in Lommel and Heverlee, Belgium, struck a brick wall. 28 people, including 22 children,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lost their lives. It was a devastating tragedy of unimaginable proportions which, beyond the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">immediate traumatic effect upon families, relatives, friends and everyone touched by it, will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have undeniably affected the lives of a very substantial number of people either forever or for</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">a very long time. One of the children killed in the crash was a British boy, Sebastian Bowles,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then 11 years of age. Not surprisingly, the facts were extensively reported.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-2"><a href="#para7-2" name="para7-2">7.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The story is relevant to the work of the Inquiry not simply because of the way in which it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been reported in the press and the extent to which the press intruded into the grief of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the family but also because all this happened while the Inquiry was underway, immediately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">after evidence about intrusive reporting which was to similar effect had been given. It is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also important because it demonstrates the work done by the PCC in circulating member</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisations about the concerns of the family; it equally highlights the unreality of a system</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that depends solely on complaints as a trigger therefore ignoring (and, thus, appearing to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">condone) potentially significant breaches of the Editors&#8217; Code.</span>

<h3>Press activity</h3>

<p id="para-id-7-3"><a href="#para7-3" name="para7-3">7.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr and Mrs Bowles learnt about the accident in the early hours of the following morning and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Bowles travelled to Switzerland by the first available flight. That afternoon, he learnt that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sebastian had not survived and he was joined by his wife and their nine year old daughter at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Hotel Des Vignes which had been designated by the Swiss authorities as the centre for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parents with children involved in the crash. In the morning of 15 March, with other families,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the three of them were taken to the scene of the crash. Although press photographers had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not been permitted onto the hotel property (and coaches had been placed in front of the gate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to obstruct the view and line of sight), they were photographed from a distance with neither</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their knowledge nor their consent while they waited under the porch of the hotel to get on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the coach that would transport them to the scene. On 16 March, one of these photographs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Bowles family (including Sebastian&#8217;s younger sister, obviously grieving) was published</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the Daily Mail.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref111" href="#footnote111">111</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-4"><a href="#para7-4" name="para7-4">7.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">16 March saw the publication of a great deal of other material. Prior to the trip, a website</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been set up as a blog so that the children on the trip could send messages to their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">families, sharing their experiences both in writing and by photographs. The website was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">password protected and thus was open to anyone but it was obviously intended to provide a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mechanism for personal communication. It included a photograph of Sebastian in his skiing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">outfit; this photograph soon appeared on The Sun website; a representative of Mr Bowles&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">employers contacted The Sun requesting that no photographs be published and (when told</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it had been put on the website) asked that it should not be reproduced in print. However,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no attention was paid to this request and the photograph was carried on the front page. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">addition, the paper quoted comments and salutations written by Sebastian, clearly intended</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be personal but which had formed part of his daily postings to his family.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-5"><a href="#para7-5" name="para7-5">7.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Besides printing the photograph from outside the Hotel des Vignes, the Daily Mail also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">published the photograph in skiing clothes and quoted from his blog (described as &#8220;an online</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">message to his parents&#8221;). The Daily Telegraph also published the blog and the photograph</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from it. The immediate result was that the website had to be taken down although the record</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been preserved for the families.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-6"><a href="#para7-6" name="para7-6">7.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the meantime, what was described as &#8216;packs of press&#8217; descended on the Bowles family</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">homes in London and Belgium, making enquiries in the area. In Belgium, the problem</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">became sufficiently acute that the police had to be called (and had to return every half hour).</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">Perhaps more understandably, but notwithstanding requests to be left alone (not the least</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being from the representative of Mr Bowles&#8217; employers), British and other journalists politely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approached them (once with flowers, sometimes apologetically) but all were then prepared</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to reduce their requests into writing and did so.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-7"><a href="#para7-7" name="para7-7">7.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">More was to come. Mr Bowles had a Facebook site which he believes had a privacy setting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;friends only&#8217; on which he had published personal, family photographs to share with his family</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and friends. On 17 March, a number of these photographs appeared on The Mail Online: Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Bowles had not given permission (not would he have given permission) for what he described</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as photographs of an &#8220;obviously private, personal and family nature&#8221; to be published. These</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographs caused him to contact Giles Crown, a friend who is also a media lawyer. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">spoke to the PCC whose on duty representative was sympathetic and asked him to put his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns into writing; Mr Crown then wrote to the various editors (copied to the PCC) that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">afternoon.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-8"><a href="#para7-8" name="para7-8">7.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The letter made it clear that Mr and Mrs Bowles &#8220;sincerely wish to be left to grieve the death</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of their son in peace without media intrusion&#8221; and referred to various clauses of the Editors&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Code; particular emphasis could be placed on clauses 3(i) (privacy), 3(iii) (photographs in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private places), 5(i) (intrusion into grief), 6(ii) (photographs of children without consent). The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">letteraskedthattheprivacyofamemorialserviceberespectedandthatallprivatephotographs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be removed from all media websites; although without limitation, this particularly referred to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the taking or publication of photographs of Sebastian&#8217;s younger sister. The letter suggested</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that human decency, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC Code all demanded that the privacy of the family be respected.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-9"><a href="#para7-9" name="para7-9">7.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was no immediate response from the Daily Mail but a follow up email on 18 March</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(Sunday) elicited a reply on 20 March to the effect that the photographs had been taken from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Facebook page on the Friday without permission but that they were &#8220;openly accessible&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that, as the privacy settings had been increased, they would be removed. The photograph</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken at the Hotel des Vignes of three members of the Bowles family (notwithstanding that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one of them was clearly a child) had not been removed by the time that Mr Crown&#8217;s statement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was circulated to Core Participants. The Daily Mail now explains that the photograph had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obtained from a respectable picture agency (which it believed should have asked itself the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">correct questions) and that they were not aware that the photograph included Sebastian&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sister who was not identified in the caption, although she had, in fact, been cropped out of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">another photograph.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-10"><a href="#para7-10" name="para7-10">7.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Sun similarly referred to the fact that the photograph from the online blog had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">distributed by picture agencies and was clearly available which is why they considered it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate to publish it. By the time that Mr Crown spoke to the editor of the Daily Telegraph</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(who knew family and had been a fellow school governor with Mrs Bowles) he was told that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he was &#8220;late to the party&#8221; and that he had held off publishing because he knew Mr Bowles</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although it was legitimate to publish a photograph that was in the public domain and had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been taken in a public place.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-11"><a href="#para7-11" name="para7-11">7.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It was not only the press in the UK that published material of which complaint is made; Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Crown has learnt that the Belgian Journalists&#8217; Council (Raad) is investigating certain aspects</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the reporting of the incident by the Belgian media particularly in relation to &#8220;people in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">vulnerablepositions,suchasminorsandvictimsandtheirfamilies&#8221;andthat&#8220;anyidentification</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">must be weighed against the social importance of reporting&#8221;.</span>
 <p id="para-id-7-12"><a href="#para7-12" name="para7-12">7.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Bowles is the first to recognise that the accident was a tragedy of national significance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in Belgium and Switzerland; he had no objection to extensive media coverage of it and that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sebastian&#8217;s nationality provided an obvious focus for the UK press. His objection has been to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the personal nature of the coverage and the intrusion.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-13"><a href="#para7-13" name="para7-13">7.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The way in which this story was reported undeniably raises issues under the Editors&#8217; Code in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to privacy, the discretion surrounding the reporting of grief and shock (particularly in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to the reporting and photographing of such grief in children) and the extent to which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is appropriate to publish photographs or material such as that trawled from the school trip</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">website which one would have thought would obviously not have been intended for public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consumption. This raises the question of who should be considering these issues, the value</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a complaint (the damage having been done and no regret being sufficient to remove the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">additional impact that the press coverage had) and the need for an enunciation of standards.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-14"><a href="#para7-14" name="para7-14">7.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although I might have a clear view, I do not think it would assist if I sought to take the place of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a regulator in this very topical case although it certainly says something about the practices</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press. The most important point, however, is that it is not in the least surprising that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Bowles does not pursue a complaint; his focus remains on the loss of his son. The matter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was put clearly by Mr Crown in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref112" href="#footnote112">112</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I would just like to try and make clear that [the Bowles] family have no wish to have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a fight with the media in any sense. They gave evidence reluctantly because they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">felt it was the right thing to do. They are disappointed that with regard to such an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">immense tragedy they would have expected some greater restraint from the media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the way the tragedy was reported and in [Mr Bowles&#8217;] view that wasn&#8217;t the case.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Just to emphasise, their over-riding desire [is] that their privacy is maintained as it is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">still, as you will understand, a very recent event and additional publicity at this point</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would greatly aggravate the family&#8217;s [grieving].&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-15"><a href="#para7-15" name="para7-15">7.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As much as any of the stories covered by this Report, this account underlines the very real</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dilemma faced by the press when balancing the respect that is owed to those who suffer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">almost unimaginable personal tragedy with which, in some way, they have to come to terms,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the legitimate public interest in an incident that has significance for everyone. I repeat</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the proposition that if nobody will review editorial decisions in the absence of a formal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaint, (that would require energy to deal with by someone who has far greater issues to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have to confront it), is, in my view, a serious lacuna in our approach to the maintenance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards.</span>

<h2>8. Recent events: royal photographs</h2>

<p id="para-id-8-1"><a href="#para8-1" name="para8-1">8.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At the conclusion of the hearings on 24 July 2012, I repeated that I would not hesitate to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ventilate anything that happened over the months prior to publication of the Report, which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I felt impacted on the work of the Inquiry. In the event, there have been a large number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories which warrant attention and justify consideration as part of the Terms of Reference.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the basis that I have decided that it is not necessary or appropriate to hold further hearings</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or seek further submissions (save in response to letters issued under Rule 13 of the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rules 2006), I do not intend to refer to most other than to comment that the argument that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry has had a chilling effect on journalism does not appear to have been borne out.</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">There are, however, two stories that are of such importance, or such value to the Terms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Reference of the Inquiry, they must be addressed in some detail even though the latter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reveals no impropriety on the part of the UK press.</span>
<h3>HRH Prince Henry of Wales</h3>

<p id="para-id-8-2"><a href="#para8-2" name="para8-2">8.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first story that requires attention is the recent publicity surrounding the behaviour of HRH</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prince Henry of Wales (Prince Harry), a 28 year old army officer and third in line to the throne.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-3"><a href="#para8-3" name="para8-3">8.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is unnecessary to rehearse the circumstances in which, following the death of Diana,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Princess of Wales in a road traffic accident (which occurred while she was followed by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">paparazzi photographers), the press agreed to respect the privacy of Prince Harry and his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">elder brother during their school years. It is equally unnecessary to outline the various stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that have been printed about him thereafter; nobody could suggest that he was not a public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">figure and there is no doubt that his conduct has and can legitimately generate questions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the discussion of which is entirely in the public interest. The issues which recent events have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">revealed concern the extent to which he is entitled to any private life or privacy and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impact of publication of photographs on the internet.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-4"><a href="#para8-4" name="para8-4">8.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having received plaudits for his work during the course of The Queen&#8217;s Diamond Jubilee and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as an Olympic Ambassador, during August 2012, while on leave, Prince Harry went on holiday</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to a resort in Las Vegas; as usual, he was accompanied by personal protection officers. During</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the course of the holiday, on 21 August, he invited a group into the apartment which he</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">occupied and, in their presence, is said to have played a game of &#8220;strip billiards&#8221;. However it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arose, at least two photographs were taken of him naked, one of which showed him shielding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a naked girl and another embracing the girl. The photographs are reported to have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken on a mobile phone.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-5"><a href="#para8-5" name="para8-5">8.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The photographs were quickly sold to an American website TM .com and put on the internet;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they were also published by the blogger Paul Staines on his<span style="font-style:italic"> Guido</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Fawkes</span> blog based in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ireland. Equally quickly, contact was made by or on behalf of St James&#8217;s Palace (for the Prince)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the PCC; this was followed up by a letter dated 22 August 2012, requesting circulation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">managing editors so that the position of the palace was clear. The PCC circulated the letter,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">quoting the concern expressed but without commenting upon it. In the light of what followed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is important to set out what it says in detail:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;As we understand the position following a telephone call to St James&#8217;s Palace this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">afternoon, a number of British newspapers have jointly purchased the photographs</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and have served notice of their intention to publish them both on-line and in their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapers. They have asked what the reaction of St. James&#8217;s Palace would be to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">such behaviour on their part.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">As we have already discussed with you, the photographs in question were taken on an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">entirelyprivateoccasionandinthosecircumstancestherewasamorethanreasonable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expectation of privacy. No matter of public interest (as those words are understood</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in English law) is raised by these photographs. The fact that they have appeared in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">another jurisdiction is meaningless. The only possible reason for publication of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">photographs is prurience and nothing more. As such any publication would be a clear</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">breach of Clause 3 of the PCC Code. We should be grateful if you would circulate this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">letter to the relevant managing editors of your members so that they are fully aware</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of St James&#8217;s Palace&#8217;s position and the fact that they entirely reserve their rights as to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any further steps that they may take should publication take place.&#8221;</span>
 <p id="para-id-8-6"><a href="#para8-6" name="para8-6">8.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 23 August, the entire British press respected the wishes of St James&#8217;s Palace and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographs were not published. However, The Sun created a mock up of one of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographs, using its picture editor and a 21 year old undertaking work experience on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its fashion desk (also described as an intern), both of whom, the caption reported, were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;happy to strip&#8221; although the image, which had also been placed on its website, was later</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">removed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref113" href="#footnote113">113</a></sup> Many newspapers blamed the effect of this Inquiry when asked why they did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">print the photographs. Later that day, The Sun changed its mind and, in a mood described</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in The Sunday Times as &#8216;jubilant&#8217;, uploaded the images onto its website and published the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographs (one of which was on the front page) the following day.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-7"><a href="#para8-7" name="para8-7">8.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When the decision had been made David Dinsmore, the interim managing editor of The Sun,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wrote to Lord Hunt, the Chairman of the PCC, to the effect that it was becoming &#8220;increasingly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perverse not to publish the pictures&#8221;. The Sun published its own account of its reasons. Other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">titles joined the debate and were, in the main, supportive of The Sun; it is unnecessary to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consider any but The Sunday Times. In the absence of any formal complaint from the Prince,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC has chosen to do nothing, explaining why it had taken that course. Each of these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arguments repays detailed analysis not least for their failure to deal with the other side of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case which, however partisan the press is entitled to be, raises important issues for debate.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The purpose of putting the argument is to ensure that the public have a fuller account of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">competing arguments than might be received simply by reading the newspapers.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-8"><a href="#para8-8" name="para8-8">8.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Before going to the detailed arguments, it is worth setting out the relevant terms of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Editors&#8217; Code of Practice, drawn up by editors and agreed by those who subscribe to the PCC</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">(including The Sun). Paragraph 3 (headed Privacy) provides:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">i Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life, home,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">health and correspondence including digital communications.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ii Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any individual&#8217;s private life</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">without consent. Account will be taken of the complainant&#8217;s own public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">disclosures of information.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">iii It is unacceptable to photograph individuals in private places without their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">consent.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Note: Private places are public or private property where there is a reasonable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expectation of privacy.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There is an exception to this provision where the publication can be demonstrated</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to be in the public interest. That is defined in this way:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">1. The public interest includes, but is not confined to: (i) detecting or exposing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">crime or serious impropriety. (ii) Protecting public health and safety. (iii)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Preventing the public from being misled by an action or statement of an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">individual or organisation.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2. There is a public interest in freedom of expression itself.</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">3. Whenever the public interest is invoked, the PCC will require editors to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">demonstratefullythattheyreasonablybelievedthatpublication,orjournalistic</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">activity undertaken with a view to publication, would be in the public interest</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and how, and with whom, that was established at the time.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">4. The PCC will consider the extent to which material is already in the public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">domain or will become so. ...</span>

<p id="para-id-8-9"><a href="#para8-9" name="para8-9">8.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The legitimate questions which arise are: (a) Was the photograph taken in circumstances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of privacy? (b) Does the Prince lose his right to privacy because he has invited to his hotel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suite people whom he does not know? (c) Is there any basis for contending that the Prince</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consented to the taking of the photograph (there being no suggestion that he did) and, if he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not, is there a difference between taking the photograph (which the Code describes as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unacceptable) and publishing it? (c) Accepting that there is a public interest in freedom of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expression itself, was there any public interest in the publication of the photographs (rather</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than the story with the description of the photographs)?</span>

<p id="para-id-8-10"><a href="#para8-10" name="para8-10">8.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A more general question can also be posed about the Code. It is entirely understandable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that a public interest can, in certain circumstances, defeat the rights to privacy enshrined in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Code (and, of course, Article 8 of the ECHR) and that freedom of expression is itself in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public interest (although that cannot defeat the privacy right in every case because that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would make the provision meaningless). It is more difficult to see why &#8216;the extent to which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material is already in the public domain&#8217; should itself create a public interest which permits</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication. It might be that it ought to be cast as a separate question but, on the basis that</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the code is a statement of ethical good practice, it is open to question whether the ethical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">balance should be affected simply because others who do not hold themselves bound by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such a code ignore its principles.</span>
<h4>The Sun&#8217;s letter</h4>

<p id="para-id-8-11"><a href="#para8-11" name="para8-11">8.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Dinsmore raised seven points, not all of which address the questions set out above, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which it is worthwhile considering in turn. The first concerned the legitimate public debate.</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">He said:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The entire UK media including both print, online and television has reported on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the fact and existence of these photographs. This has in turn generated a legitimate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public debate as to the Prince&#8217;s behaviour. There is now a debate across the country</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as to whether such conduct is acceptable from the third in line to the throne who is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">increasingly taking on a more public and official role ... That debate should not take</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">place in a vacuum.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-12"><a href="#para8-12" name="para8-12">8.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The argument regarding the legitimacy of public debate is powerful but, in the context of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this particular publication, of limited, if any, relevance. There is no doubt that the remit of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his protection officers is an important issue with a legitimate public interest. Further, for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">purposes of this argument, it is appropriate to assume that whether the Prince&#8217;s conduct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is &#8220;acceptable&#8221; is also a matter of public interest (although a point made later in the letter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about his position in the army appears somewhat specious). Such a debate, however, did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">take place in a vacuum: what transpired and what the photographs revealed was graphically</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described in print. The debate did not need the pictures.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-13"><a href="#para8-13" name="para8-13">8.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The next three points can be taken together. The second and third concern the fact that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the media had identified the website on which the photographs could be viewed, making</span>
 <span style="font-size: 15px;">the point that 77% of the public have access to the internet so that the photographs are in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public domain (which the PCC Code requires to be taken into account). The number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hits to the pictures, it is asserted, rose from 25.8 million to 160 million by 11:00hrs on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">morning of 23 August (although how much of that is the consequence of the press coverage is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">another matter); the photographs were also on Facebook. It was argued that the suggestion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(by the Palace) that the fact that the photographs have appeared in another jurisdiction is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;meaningless&#8217; was to miss the point that the internet transcends jurisdictions.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-14"><a href="#para8-14" name="para8-14">8.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The fourth point is the reverse of the third. The fact that the photographs are so widely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">available on the internet creates an issue for those who do not have access to the internet so</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there is &#8220;an unfair and inappropriate situation adversely affecting the ongoing debate in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this country&#8221;. Mr Dinsmore goes on:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;That situation cannot be allowed to continue in a debate of such importance where</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">everybody should have equal access to the photographs in question and not just</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">those who can access the internet.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-15"><a href="#para8-15" name="para8-15">8.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These points utterly ignore a number of equally valid arguments. First, it is important to repeat</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it is entirely possible to have the debate (however important it is) without seeing the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographs at all. Second, anybody who feels that it is necessary to see them (for whatever</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reason) is able to do so, for the vast majority of those without internet doubtless will know</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">someone who has access, or could go to a library or to one of any number of places where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">access to the internet is possible. Third, and of particular importance, it ignores the fact that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there may also be a large number of people who do not want to see the photographs or,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">even more likely, who do not want their children to see the photographs. To some extent,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">parents can control what their children can access on the internet: if they take their child into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a newsagent, garage or supermarket &#8211; or past a news stall &#8211; the control that they must be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">entitled to exercise is lost.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-16"><a href="#para8-16" name="para8-16">8.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The fourth argument resonates across a range of issues. The fact that something is on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">internet does not justify its publication in a newspaper. The internet is an uncontrolled space</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with material upon it which I anticipate The Sun would not wish to publish because it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pornographic, racist or offends one of the many other codes of decency to which most people</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aspire. Bob Satchwell of the Society of Editors put the point in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref114" href="#footnote114">114</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Of course, freedom of the press is important. But just because you can publish</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">something doesn&#8217;t mean that you should.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-17"><a href="#para8-17" name="para8-17">8.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The fifth argument advanced by Mr Dinsmore is to challenge the assertion that the reason</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for publication of the photographs would be prurience and nothing more and then to repeat</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the first argument about the issues that arise while ignoring the ability to have the debate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">without sight of the photographs. The letter then goes on to assert:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;For that debate to take place in an informed light these photographs should be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">published in accordance not only with our Article 10 right to impart information but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">also in accordance with the general public&#8217;s right to receive it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-18"><a href="#para8-18" name="para8-18">8.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Article 8/Article 10 debate again requires an analysis of the public interest although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;special considerations attach to photographs in the field of privacy. ... As a means of invading</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">privacy, a photograph is particularly intrusive&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref115" href="#footnote115">115</a></sup> In reality, it takes the argument no further</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">forward.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-19"><a href="#para8-19" name="para8-19">8.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Dinsmore then cites a decision of the PCC from 2010 concerned with the magazine</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Loaded where a photograph had been given a wide circulation on the internet such that it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was untenable to rule that it was wrong for it to be used in a magazine. This decision (part of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the jurisprudence of the PCC) is itself open to criticism and is further discussed in the light of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the response of the PCC and the further Royal story.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-20"><a href="#para8-20" name="para8-20">8.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, Mr Dinsmore suggests that although the Prince is naked, the photographs do not show</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">him &#8220;in any situation of extreme personal embarrassment nor do they reveal any intimate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">details of his body&#8221;. I am not sure of the basis on which Mr Dinsmore makes the assessment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(if this is what he is saying) that these photographs are less invasive of the Prince&#8217;s privacy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than they might have been and therefore justifiable or that they would not cause extreme</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal embarrassment: it may not be without interest that the 21-year old who posed for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the mock-up is reported to later to have tweeted &#8220;lol 5 mins of fame #cringin&#8221;.</span>
<h4>The Sun article</h4>

<p id="para-id-8-21"><a href="#para8-21" name="para8-21">8.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The full front page headline &#8220;HEIR IT IS Pic of naked Harry you&#8217;ve already seen on the internet&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(inconsistent with the argument that the purpose of publishing the pictures was to show</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them to those who did not have access to the internet), goes on &#8220;HEIR IT IS; WE FIGHT FOR</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">PRESS FREEDOM&#8221;, &#8220;PRINT HARRY&#8221; and &#8220;Naked Vegas pics swept the world on web. Now</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">it&#8217;s vital you see them here The Sun SAYS&#8221;. The article goes on to assert that its readers</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;have been prevented from seeing&#8221; the pictures in print and later that &#8220;the Press were still</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effectively banned from using the pictures&#8221; so that &#8220;millions of people who get their news in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">print or have no web access could not take a full part in that national conversation because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they could not see the images&#8221;. It also argues that the Prince had &#8220;compromised his own</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privacy&#8221;. The paper ends:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It is absurd in the internet age newspapers like The Sun could be stopped from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">publishing stories and pictures already seen by millions on the free-for-all that is the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">web.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-22"><a href="#para8-22" name="para8-22">8.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Quite apart from the merits of the decision, this article raises other issues of concern. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">request from the solicitors acting on behalf of St James&#8217;s Palace is set out at length above. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does no more than respond to a request for their reaction to the stated intention to publish</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and state their position. It does not &#8220;effectively ban&#8221; their use. It does not prevent anyone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from seeing them. Neither is the issue one of press freedom: the press (including The Sun)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were free to do what they wanted and to publish what they wished. The Palace only referred</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice to which The Sun voluntarily subscribes. The only mechanism</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that could have prevented The Sun from publishing the photographs was an injunction</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obtained from the High Court and there is not the slightest suggestion that such relief was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">even sought. Yet that is not how the story was told.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-23"><a href="#para8-23" name="para8-23">8.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, reliance was placed on the fact that the pictures were on &#8220;the free-for-all that is the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">web&#8221;. Quite apart from the other material available on the web that The Sun would not print,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the point of the Editors&#8217; Code is that newspapers subscribe (or are supposed to subscribe)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to higher standards than &#8220;free-for-all&#8221; which does not put a bar in place at all. Further, if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that is the answer, it is a real risk that a determined effort could be made to put a story</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">or a photograph that offends the Code onto the internet through an intermediary in order</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to demonstrate that it is then in the public domain and, thus, can be printed. It is open to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question whether such a &#8220;free-for-all&#8221; is in the public interest.</span>
<h4>Other Comment</h4>

<p id="para-id-8-24"><a href="#para8-24" name="para8-24">8.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Sunday Times (owned, of course, also by NI) published an editorial on Sunday 26 August</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">under the headline &#8220;THE SUN&#8217;S BRAVE LONE STAND FOR PRESS FREEDOM&#8221;, saying that Prince</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Harry had put the issue of press freedom squarely on the agenda and asserting that other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers did not publish &#8220;because of the atmosphere created&#8221; by the Inquiry. It cited</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">many occasions when British newspapers had been deprived of information freely available</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to counterparts overseas including the abdication crisis and the Spycatcher affair, although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it recognised that people in Britain were not being deprived of anything but were &#8220;just not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allowed to see it in their newspapers&#8221;. The leader goes on:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Critics said The Sun&#8217;s public interest arguments were a convenient mask for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">commercial motives. It is a spurious criticism. Newspapers are fighting for their lives</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the toughest of economic climates combined with technological changes that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">weigh heavily against traditional print. If they are not commercial they will die and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they cannot let the internet become the prime forum for communication. But that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was not the sole purpose of publishing. There is a dangerous coalition forming of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">aggrieved film and television stars, out-of-sorts Labour politicians and bien pensants</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who would happily bring much greater regulation and censorship to the press. They</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">believe they should decide what is in the public interest and not the millions who buy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the red top papers. To publish these pictures was a defiant gesture to those would-be</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">moral arbiters.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Of course many images and much content on the internet will rightly never find their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">way into our newspapers for the good reasons of taste, accuracy and relevance. But</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this was different. It was of enormous interest to the public and it was in the public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interest to know how the third in line to the throne really behaves. The public can then</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decide how it regards him. The bigger issue is the future of the press. If it is gagged</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and stifled it will die and the country would be hugely poorer for it. John Wilkes fought</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">long and hard for freedom of expression, including publishing what was regarded as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pornography at the time. Lord Justice Leveson, it is hoped, understands that. It was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">right to publish &#8212; and not be damned.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-25"><a href="#para8-25" name="para8-25">8.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is a remarkable article. On the subject of the story, there is no discussion of the Editors&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Code of Conduct, of any right that Prince Harry might have to privacy or any public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in publication of the photographs. Given the approach of the Palace to the PCC, there was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no question of the press being gagged, of an attack on press freedom or an attempt to hide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the story (as in the abdication). The commercial issues facing the press are understood but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nobody has ever suggested that the only way the problem can be solved is by abandoning the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Code of Conduct. As for the millions who buy red-top papers, The Sunday Times published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the result of a poll to the effect that 61% of respondents thought that The Sun was wrong to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publish the photographs and 68% thought that the Prince&#8217;s behaviour was acceptable.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-26"><a href="#para8-26" name="para8-26">8.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As for censorship, not a single witness either orally or in writing sought censorship. Everyone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognised the importance of a free press and the benefits of public interest investigative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalism. No one suggested they should be the arbiters of press practice: all wanted the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press to follow the letter and spirit of a code for which the editors had responsibility. That is</span>
 <span style="font-size: 15px;">not to say that they believed in the present operation of the PCC or considered that the Code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could not be improved but that is not the criticism that the editorial makes.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-27"><a href="#para8-27" name="para8-27">8.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It would be possible to examine the coverage of other titles and the selective reporting of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opinion from politicians and others. It is a matter of comment that, with the exception of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Independent on Sunday, almost all the national Sunday titles took the same view as The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sunday Times. The press are, of course, entitled to a partisan view but it is difficult to see</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">how it represents its readers if the majority opinion is not even expressed or explained. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inference may be that the agenda it was following was its own.</span>
<h4>The PCC</h4>

<p id="para-id-8-28"><a href="#para8-28" name="para8-28">8.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The way in which the PCC generally responds to complaints has already been analysed at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">length.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref116" href="#footnote116">116</a></sup> On the other hand, this very recent example of the approach taken by the PCC,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">following the conclusion of all the evidence heard by the Inquiry, is extremely illuminative.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, there are sufficient specific features of its reaction which it is worth considering</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in detail and which justify (or at least excuse) what might be a measure of repetition.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-29"><a href="#para8-29" name="para8-29">8.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Following contact from St James&#8217;s Palace, the story continues with the head of complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and pre-publication services. She passed the letter from the solicitors on to the editors and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">invited any discussion about code issues. It is not suggested that she was approached by The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sun for advice pre-publication or at all (although the letter setting out their defence was sent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">before the photographs were, in fact, published). It has since been reported that the PCC did,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in fact, provide advice to other editors, on request, about the relevant issues.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-30"><a href="#para8-30" name="para8-30">8.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Meanwhile, after The Sun&#8217;s publication of the photographs, the PCC received around 3,800</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints that the photographs breached clause 3 of the Code: by the time of their regular</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meeting, no formal complaint had been made by or on behalf of Prince Harry. In a statement,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC goes on to observe:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Commission would be best placed to understand these issues &#8211; including the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">circumstances in which the photographs were taken &#8211; with the formal involvement</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of Prince Harry&#8217;s representatives. In addition, an investigation by the Commission,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">without consent, would have the potential itself to pose an intrusion.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Commission is grateful to the many members of the public who have contacted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it to express concerns about The Sun&#8217;s coverage but has concluded that it would be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">inappropriate for it to open an investigation at this time for the reasons above.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-31"><a href="#para8-31" name="para8-31">8.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At the conclusion of its statement, the PCC comment that it would be wrong to preempt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the conclusions that it might reach were a complaint to be pursued but it &#8220;notes&#8221; that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question of how to apply the privacy provisions in relation to material freely available on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the internet has been faced on a number of occasions in decided cases, observing that each</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision is reached only after a detailed examination of the facts of the case. It then makes the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">final comment (to which reference is made later) that it will publish guidance for publications</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on these matters.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-32"><a href="#para8-32" name="para8-32">8.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The upshot is that although the majority of those polled (as reported in The Sunday Times)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">felt it wrong to publish the photographs and a substantial number of members of the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">felt sufficiently strongly about the matter that they complained to the PCC, the PCC will say</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nothing about the matter, one way or the other, unless Prince Harry personally complains.</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">This is notwithstanding the fact that his views are well known: they are reflected in the letter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that solicitors wrote on behalf of St James&#8217;s Palace prior to publication. The PCC is hardly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enhancing its reputation as a definitive arbiter of press standards by taking this course.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-33"><a href="#para8-33" name="para8-33">8.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It may be the case that the PCC might have been or be better able to understand the issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the perspective of the Prince if he provided further details of the circumstances in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the photographer came to be in his suite and was not prevented from taking the photographs;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">however, to ask him to do that would, undeniably, constitute &#8216;further intrusion&#8217; by providing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information not presently available and which would all then be deployed in public. The PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argues that investigating without the consent of the Prince would have the potential itself</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to pose an intrusion but The Sun had to make its decision based on the material then in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public domain. If he were to have complained, it is not difficult to see the paper seeking to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">put questions to St James&#8217;s Palace about these matters in order to provide some additional</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arguments not available at the time. In the context of this case, that would undeniably be</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">&#8216;further intrusion&#8217;.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-34"><a href="#para8-34" name="para8-34">8.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There could be circumstances, perhaps concerned with whether or not the subject of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story has &#8216;set it up&#8217;, that to investigate without a complaint might constitute an intrusion,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but there is no suggestion of that sort of circumstance in this case. Here, the question is not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether there is a public interest in the facts of the story and St James&#8217;s Palace has not sought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to contend to the contrary. The only question relates to the publication of the photographs.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In that regard, there is sufficient information available in the public domain and the stance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">St James&#8217;s Palace is quite clear from the letter which was circulated. If the PCC is concerned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about standards and the Editors&#8217; Code of Conduct, there is nothing to stop it analysing the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue based on the material that was available to The Sun at the time: in doing so, everybody</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would know where the PCC stood on the matter. As it is, the fact that at least 3,800 members</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the public felt that it was appropriate for the PCC to look at this complaint is deemed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">irrelevant but, in reality, by saying (and doing) nothing, the PCC will be seen as endorsing the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach of The Sun whether or not it does so. The Sun having &#8216;got away&#8217; without adverse</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adjudication (which is what the editors say they most fear) will be taken as a green light and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a precedent for the future.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-35"><a href="#para8-35" name="para8-35">8.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Issuing guidance (which is what the PCC identifies that it intends to do &#8220;drawing on its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decisions in previous cases&#8221;)<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref117" href="#footnote117">117</a></sup> is precisely the effect of considering the facts in this particular</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case. Indeed, Mr Dinsmore throws the gauntlet down to the PCC in the sixth argument in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his letter of 23 August when, in relation to its decision in the case involving the magazine</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Loaded, it ruled against the complaint &#8220;on a situation very similar to this&#8221; (where material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had already been given a wide circulation) and asked the PCC to distinguish that complaint</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from this. Because of the further story involving the Duchess of Cambridge, this general point</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is analysed below.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-36"><a href="#para8-36" name="para8-36">8.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The purpose of recounting this story is not to reach a view, one way or the other, about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication of these photographs. In the context of this Inquiry, what this episode illuminates</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is the adequacy (or otherwise) of the mechanism for maintaining the standards to which the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press loudly asserts it adheres. It has since been announced that, in the light of his deployment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Afghanistan, Prince Harry will not pursue a complaint but there was, in truth, no point in St</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">James&#8217;s Palace making a complaint to the PCC. If such a complaint was rejected, it will signal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the very free for all based on what is available on the web; if one had been made and upheld,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is abundantly clear from the various press reports that followed the publication that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adjudication will be rejected and blamed on what is said to be the effect of the Inquiry. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">truth, the moment has been lost and the right to publish effectively endorsed without the</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">contrary argument having been analysed. To say that guidance will be issued in the future</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does not carry the issue any further.</span>
<h3>HRH The Duchess of Cambridge</h3>

<p id="para-id-8-37"><a href="#para8-37" name="para8-37">8.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The story of Prince Harry was quickly overtaken by a different story which evinced a very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different reaction. On 14 September 2012, a French magazine, Closer, published photographs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of HRH The Duchess of Cambridge sunbathing topless taken by a paparazzo with an ultra long</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lens while she was on holiday in a private chateaux belonging to Viscount Linley in Provence.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is said (and, having regard to the length of the lens required, doubtless entirely accurately)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the photographs can only have been taken from a considerable distance away. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication was followed by republication in the Irish Daily Star (much to the annoyance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Desmond whose Northern and Shell company is a part owner of the paper) and in other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers and magazines. The photographs are on the internet.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-38"><a href="#para8-38" name="para8-38">8.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The press in the UK universally condemned the publication of these photographs as a gross</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breach of the privacy to which the Duchess was entitled. The Sunday Times<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref118" href="#footnote118">118</a></sup> published an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editorial identifying a contrast between the photographs of Prince Harry (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> when</span><span style="font-style:italic"> he</span><span style="font-style:italic"> invited</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people into his hotel suite for his naked antics<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> respect</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> which</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> &#8220;</span> rightly did not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">complain<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;)</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> these</span><span style="font-style:normal"> photographs</span><span style="font-style:normal"> (&#8220;</span> of a young couple on a very private holiday<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;</span><span style="font-style:normal"> so</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> William</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Catherine</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> rightly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> resorted</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> law</span> &#8221;) although noting that they &#8220;were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">freely available on the internet within hours&#8221;. The editorial also said:</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Editors of British newspapers did not need the threat of privacy laws or even Lord</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Justice Leveson&#8217;s inquiry to know not to publish these pictures. When they were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hawked around Fleet Street they were met with a cool response. It was a case of self-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regulation working; the Editors&#8217; Code specifically prohibits photographing individuals</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in private places without their consent. Newspapers in Britain in any case knew they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would face a readers&#8217; revolt if they dared to publish.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-39"><a href="#para8-39" name="para8-39">8.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The language of this editorial is revealing. The first article talks about press freedom and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">defiant gestures with the public having the right to know how the third in line to the throne</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behaves. The latter recognises that photographing individuals in private places without their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consent is specifically prohibited and that newspapers would face a revolt if they dared to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publish although I am sure that the editorial was not making the point that the decision not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to publish was because the ethical and commercial considerations ran in tandem. In the case</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Prince Harry, there was a story which, in the public interest could be told; in the case of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Duchess, there was not. In both cases, what is at issue is the publication of photographs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by editors bound by a Code of Conduct and the relevance of the fact of their publication on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the internet.</span>
<h4>The relevance of the internet</h4>

<p id="para-id-8-40"><a href="#para8-40" name="para8-40">8.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is necessary to return to the reaction from the PCC and the reference in its statement to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">internet. Following its decision not to launch any investigation into the publication by The Sun</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the photographs of Prince Harry without his consent, the statement went on:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It would be wrong to pre-empt the conclusions the Commission might reach were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a complaint to be pursued. Nonetheless, the Commission notes that the question of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">how to apply the terms of Clause 3 (Privacy) in relation to material that is freely</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">available on the internet is one that it has faced on a number of occasions in recent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">years, including in the cases of Mullan, Weir & Campbell v Scottish Sunday Express</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(2009); A Woman v Loaded (2010); Minogue v Daily Mirror/Daily Record (2010);</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and Baskerville v Daily Mail/The Independent on Sunday (2011). In each instance it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reached a decision only after a detailed examination of the facts of the case.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-41"><a href="#para8-41" name="para8-41">8.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC is not, of course, bound by the system of precedent that operates within the common</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">law. However, it is obviously important that there should be consistency of decisions provided,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the decisions are truly on point, relevant and not clearly distinguishable. Not surprisingly,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">none of the cited cases are entirely relevant because none concern members of the Royal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Family whose activities, however much in keeping with what might reasonably be expected</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of young people when relaxing in private, will attract attention if likely to titillate the prurient.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-42"><a href="#para8-42" name="para8-42">8.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Three of the four cases concerned material put onto social networking sites (and, thus, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was argued into the public domain) by the persons affected. In all three (two of which were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rejected), the PCC referred to the extent to which it was acceptable to publish information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken from such websites even if intended only for a small group of acquaintances. In the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one complaint upheld (<span style="font-style:italic"> Mullen</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> others</span> ), three survivors of the Dunblane shooting some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">13 years earlier had put material about themselves and their activities onto a website; this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information was then published alongside photographs although efforts had been made over</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the preceding years to shield them from publicity. The PCC held they had done nothing to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">warrant media scrutiny, images (even if publicly available) were taken out of context and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">presented in a way designed to humiliate.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-43"><a href="#para8-43" name="para8-43">8.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The other two cases involving social networking sites can be summarised in this way. The</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">first (<span style="font-style:italic"> A</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Woman</span><span style="font-style:italic"> v</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Loaded</span> ) concerned photographs of her breasts which she had placed on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her Bebo site when she was 15 but which had since been uploaded onto the internet along</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with her name, having been easily accessed by Google search. The magazine had published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a piece discussing the fact that the material was already widely used in this way by others.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC considered that the fact that she was then 15 at the time of the photographs raised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues of taste but as she was an adult at the time of this publication, the additional protection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">available for children no longer applied. Given that the additional public interest required in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to material covering children is, in part, to protect them against themselves when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they are not old enough to appreciate the consequences, it is difficult to see why the fact that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">she was no longer a child should have prevented the higher standard being applied: that is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not to the point in this case. What was decided was that because the information in the same</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">form was widely available, republication did not breach the Code.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-44"><a href="#para8-44" name="para8-44">8.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second case (<span style="font-style:italic"> Baskerville</span> ) concerned material written by a civil servant relating to her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">employment which she had posted on Twitter anticipating a small circulation to her followers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but failing to take account of the ability to retweet and so reaching a far wider audience.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having decided that therewas apublic interest (the wisdom of civil servants using social media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">platforms which could give rise to claims of conflict with professional duties), notwithstanding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the distress caused, no breach of clause 3 of the Code was established.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-45"><a href="#para8-45" name="para8-45">8.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The third case is nearer in one sense (because it concerns a famous personality) but further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">away in another. Dannii Minogue complained that her pregnancy was reported prior to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">12 week scan. The Daily Mirror and the Daily Record sought to justify the breach of the rule</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">forbidding such publication on the basis that the information was available the previous day</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on a blog and on the Sydney Morning Herald website. It was argued that the news was either</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;in&#8217; or &#8216;not in&#8217; the public domain and given these reports had ceased to be private. The PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ruled the references in the blog and the website were speculative and that the purpose of</span>
 <span style="font-size: 15px;">having regard to &#8220;the extent&#8221; to which information had previously appeared was common</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sense for, if it were otherwise, reference on-line would represent automatic justification for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication. This complaint was upheld.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-46"><a href="#para8-46" name="para8-46">8.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Based upon<span style="font-style:italic"> A</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Woman</span><span style="font-style:italic"> v</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Loaded</span> , it might be thought that substantial dissemination of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material is sufficient to trump any other claim to privacy: that is precisely what Mr Dinsmore</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argued. He would doubtless point to the fact that Prince Harry was not a child; he effectively</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argued that the fact that there is no basis for suggesting that he had encouraged or consented</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the taking or publication of the photographs was more than met, first, by the public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in his behaviour and, second, by their widespread publication on the internet and elsewhere.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-47"><a href="#para8-47" name="para8-47">8.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The reality is that these cases are not truly comparable. As is patently clear, anything that any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">member of the Royal Family does will always attract attention and if widespread publication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">trumps any right to privacy, then there is no protection at all. Paparazzi will seek to obtain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what photographs they can; someone, somewhere will be only too pleased to publish them</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, if the Code was construed in that way, the door would be perpetually open to any title</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then to publish without being in breach.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-48"><a href="#para8-48" name="para8-48">8.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However,thatisnotthecasethatthepressmount.Nobodyatallhassuggestedthatpublishing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the photographs of the Duchess of Cambridge would be anything other than a breach of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Code, notwithstanding the widespread availability of the images in other jurisdictions. So, at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">least for the Royal Family, widespread availability of an image on the internet on its own is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not sufficient. There has to be some other public interest in publication of that image in order</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to justify it. For the Duchess, there clearly is not. But that equally means that playing the card</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of widespread availability is not good enough in relation to the Prince Harry photographs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">either, particularly when the public interest points that arise from the Las Vegas holiday do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not depend on sight of the photographs.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-49"><a href="#para8-49" name="para8-49">8.49</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nor can a distinction be drawn between the paparazzo who took the long lens photographs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and whoever sold the mobile phone photographs in Las Vegas: both did what they did for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">money. True, the paparazzo was not known about and had not been trusted not to betray the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">confidence which followed the invitation to visit Prince Harry in his suite, but it is difficult to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argue that this is not a distinction without a difference.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-50"><a href="#para8-50" name="para8-50">8.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is worth repeating the argument published in The Sun newspaper:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It is absurd in the internet age newspapers like The Sun could be stopped from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">publishing stories and pictures already seen by millions on the free-for-all that is the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">web.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-51"><a href="#para8-51" name="para8-51">8.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Given that this would apply equally to the photographs of the Duchess, this alone is not good</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enough. Neither is the argument that it is up to the editor to exercise his judgment.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref119" href="#footnote119">119</a></sup> In one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sense, that is always true; but such decisions must be taken within the boundaries of a clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and effective code: that is what it is for.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-52"><a href="#para8-52" name="para8-52">8.52</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Irrespective of the rhetoric in the press, this is not about censorship or banning anything;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is not about freedom of the press; it is not about statutory regulation. It is not about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editors being forbidden to publish the photographs; St James&#8217;s Palace must be entitled</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to express its own view without being accused of having taken any of these draconian</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">measures. Whatever system of press regulation is in force, ultimately, in this country, any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editor will be free to publish what he or she believes should be published. What it is about,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">however, is maintenance of standards and the requirement that an editor is held to account</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by someone for the decisions which have been made, based on a Code that has attracted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the confidence and general approval of editors and commands the confidence of the public.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Even a complaints handling mechanism resolves complaints made by the public when it is not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary to obtain further details and there is no additional intrusion beyond that which is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">already in the public domain.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-53"><a href="#para8-53" name="para8-53">8.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Neither is this a case simply about freedom of expression. The Royal Family are, of course, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public eye and its members will be held to account for what they do. But if society wants</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them also to mix with the public and in the real world, they have to be given the space to do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so and their right to have a degree of privacy (less than that available to ordinary members</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the public but more than at a level that is vanishingly small) must also be recognised.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Precisely where the line is to be drawn is not a decision for the Inquiry to make. But decisions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such as this have to be made by a body that is prepared to see the entire picture from every</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perspective. The decision requires balance and, perhaps, rather more balance than has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">afforded to the issue in the discussion that the press has initiated and conducted.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-54"><a href="#para8-54" name="para8-54">8.54</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This does not mean that photographs will not be available in other jurisdictions across the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">world, or that information will not be available about what has happened: there is no news</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">blackout and the parallel with the Abdication crisis simply does not withstand examination.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">To that extent, therefore, the Royal Family and anyone in the public eye will have to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aware of what can happen and take steps accordingly. But if the press in this country do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aspire to behave ethically and in accordance with standards that they have agreed, it does</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">mean obeying those standards consistently and not only when it suits them or when it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commercially convenient to do so. Otherwise it is a free for all.</span>

<h3>Other events</h3>

<p id="para-id-8-55"><a href="#para8-55" name="para8-55">8.55</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These are not the only stories that have been published in the period since the Inquiry has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concluded that could be the subject of comment. Watching the press, as it was clear the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry intended to do, there have been other articles and photographs that have attracted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attention and raised concerns about breach of privacy without any apparent justification</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">based in the public interest. To start to analyse further stories and further examples is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unnecessary although it is worth observing that what has been happening seems, at least in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">my judgment sufficient to undermine the criticism that the Inquiry has chilled press activity.</span>

These proceedings were compromised by the payment of a substantial donation to the Madeleinesearch fund and the publication of an apology in the Evening Standard. The Daily Mail were willing to publish a numberof &#8216;free adverts&#8217; to aid the search, but refused to publish any apology, claiming that the supportive articles they hadwritten counter-balanced the others.
