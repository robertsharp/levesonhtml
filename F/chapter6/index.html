<h1>CHAPTER 6<br/>CRITICISMS OF THE CULTURE, PRACTICES AND ETHICS OF THE PRESS</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The case studies set out in the previous Chapter provide examples of unacceptable press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices. The purpose of this Chapter is to set out the broader evidence seen and heard</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the Inquiry which illustrates that those case studies do not represent aberrations of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press, but fit within a broader context of a culture (albeit a minority culture) of unethical and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unlawful press practices.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Not least given the continuing availability of all of the evidence online, it would not be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">worthwhile for this Chapter of the Report to approach each witness in sequential fashion,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">summarising his or her testimony before moving to the next. Such an approach would fail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to do justice to the evidence in the context of an Inquiry examining the culture, practices</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and ethics of the press. Instead, the evidence will be examined thematically, in the search</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for possible trends and generic issues. Having now heard and carefully considered all the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence, it is much easier to discern these trends than it was when the evidential picture</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was unfolding at pace from the start of Module One.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In reaching the conclusions which are set out below, all the evidence that the Inquiry has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">received (whether presented orally or only in writing) has been considered and taken into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">account. Furthermore, care has been taken to differentiate between those lapses in standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which should be envisaged as isolated failings which do not exemplify any wider cultural</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue, and those which should properly be understood as indicative of a pattern or theme. As</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">previously explained, distinguishing between these two categories depends principally on a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">qualitative assessment of the evidence (viewed both in its own right and in the context of all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the evidence the Inquiry has received), but also, albeit to a lesser extent, on a quantitative</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">one.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Chapter begins, in Sections 1 &#8211; 7, by looking at the evidence heard by the Inquiry of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cultural indifference within parts of the press to individual privacy and dignity. That broad</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">theme encompasses evidence that parts of the press have used unethical and/or unlawful</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">means to access private information, including phone hacking, blagging, email hacking,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">theft, and covert surveillance. It also encompasses evidence that newspapers have published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obviously confidential information without any public interest in doing so, have harassed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subjects of stories and their families, have been insensitive in investigating and reporting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">death or tragedy, and have failed to have regard to the high level of protection appropriate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to children.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Section 8 then examines a broader critique: a complaint that the press, or parts of it, fail to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">represent women and minorities fairly. This critique is not related so much to representations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of individuals as the representation of whole classes of people.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Section 9 then considers the extent to which deliberate or reckless inaccuracy is a cultural or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">systemic problem within parts of the press. Associated with that theme, Section 10 examines</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the issue of payments for stories, and assesses the extent to which the widespread practice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of offering financial incentives for stories might incentivise inaccuracies and/or encourage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breaches of privacy.</span>
 <p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sections 11 and 12 examine the way in which the press responds to critics and complainants.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Together they consider the evidence that the press, or parts of it, are hostile to complainants,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">use attack as the best form of defence, and seek to avoid giving justified apologies or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">corrections due prominence, if they are given at all.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence deployed in this Chapter may be relevant to more than one of the headings or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">categories set out below, because they overlap. Accordingly, even if one part of the evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may have been expressly referred to only once, it may well have informed more than one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusion.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. Lack of respect for privacy and dignity</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One of the main complaints advanced by those who testified during the first two weeks of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence, and subsequently, was that a cultural strand exists within the press betraying an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unethical cultural indifference to the consequences of exposing private lives, and a failure to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">treat individuals with appropriate dignity and respect. This was, in essence, an overarching</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaint which encompasses many of the criticisms addressed below. Phone hacking,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">blagging, the widespread use of covert surveillance, harassment, and the publication of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private and confidential information all reflect, to varying extents, this cultural indifference.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The experiences of the McCanns, the Dowlers, Christopher Jefferies and Max Mosley, already</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discussed in some detail above, also exemplify this indifference. However, these high profile</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examples were by no means exceptional, nor were all or predominantly concerned with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices at the News of the World (NoTW). The Inquiry heard evidence from numerous</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">public figures and private individuals alike, who were victims of a tendency within sections</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press to treat people without respect or dignity and to publish private information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">without regard to the consequences of, or public interest in, doing so.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The singer Charlotte Church gave evidence relating to the exposure of the private lives of her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and members of her family over the course of more than a decade. From the age of 12 she</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was the subject of intense press scrutiny. She spoke of her experiences of being door-stepped</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and stalked by press and paparazzi,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> of finding evidence of a secret camera installed in her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">garden hedge,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> and of her regular pursuit by press and paparazzi whilst at home and abroad</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on holiday.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">While a child, titles regularly published details about Ms Church that can be described as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mere tittle-tattle: reports of her weight gain, drinking, or smoking.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> But more intimate details</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of her private life were published as well: when she was 17 years old, a newspaper published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">details of her sexual experiences with an ex-boyfriend, and paid the ex-boyfriend for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">story.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></span>

 <p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">After attaining majority, Ms Church continued to suffer from press intrusion. Three examples</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the evidence she gave of intrusive and distressing coverage were particularly notable.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, Ms Church&#8217;s pregnancy was revealed by The Sun, despite the title&#8217;s knowledge that she</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was still in her first trimester of pregnancy, and notwithstanding a request from Ms Church&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PR agent that the title not publish any details until the end of the first trimester. Ms Church</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">spoke of the upset that publication had caused to her and her family: her parents were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unaware that she was pregnant until the article was brought to their attention.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, as part of its coverage of an alleged plot to kidnap Ms Church, the NoTW published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">details sufficient to identify Ms Church&#8217;s address, despite express requests to refrain from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">doing so.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> The publication of those details caused Ms Church untold anxiety, and potentially</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">placed her at an increased risk from the very plot on which the title was reporting.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The third example was, perhaps, the most egregious, given that the published story related</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not to Ms Church herself, but to her parents, who were, to all intents and purposes, private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">people with no public life or persona. On 11 November 2005, the NoTW published a story</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">entitled &#8220;Church&#8217;s three in a bed cocaine shock&#8221; next to a picture of Ms Church. Despite the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fact that the juxtaposition of headline and photo gave the (probably deliberate) impression</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the allegations in the story related to Ms Church herself, they in fact related to her father.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The content of the story was deeply intrusive and contained intimate details of the private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lives of both Ms Church&#8217;s mother and father. The story began: &#8220;Superstar Charlotte Church&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mum tried to kill herself because her husband is a love rat hooked on cocaine and three-in-a-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bed orgies.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> Whether the substance of the article was true or false, there was no conceivable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest in the publication of this story which had a profound effect on Ms Church and</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">her family.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> As Ms Church noted:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It was basically just totally sensationalised, and whether partially or wholly true, I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">just really hated the fact that my parents, who had never been in this industry apart</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from in looking after me, were being exposed and vilified in this fashion. It just had a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">massive, massive impact on my family life, on my mother&#8217;s health, which the News of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the World had reported on before then, on her mental health state and her hospital</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">treatment&#8230; So they knew how vulnerable she was and still printed this story, which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was horrific. And I just &#8211; I can&#8217;t think of any justification for printing a story like that.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The justification, according to Paul McMullan, was circulation. The story interested the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">readership and that, for him, was justification enough for publication.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MsChurchhas,tosomeextent,courtedpressattention.Aspartofherpromotionalobligations,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">she appears in the press, on radio and on television and has spoken about her relationships</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and private life in this context. In addition, she has chosen to appear in magazines such as OK!</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Hello with her children. However, on any construction of the Editors&#8217; Code of Conduct,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those facts alone cannot justify the persistent and intrusive level of press interest to which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">she has been subjected, nor can it justify the publication of private information without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regard to the public interest or the consequences of publication.</span>

 <p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In any case, as Ms Church&#8217;s evidence showed, an appearance in a magazine such as OK! or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Hello does not necessarily indicate a desire to expose her entire private live or the lives of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her family to public view. In her case, her evidence was that her decision to appear in these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">magazines with her new-born baby was specifically taken to control the release of pictures of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her child in a context where up to six paparazzi were camped outside her home during and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">after the home-birth of her daughter.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup> Moreover, even if it were the case that Ms Church</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had, by her previous conduct, relinquished any reasonable expectation of privacy, she had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not done so on behalf of her parents.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Church&#8217;s evidence bore similarities to that given by the writer JK Rowling. She too has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been subjected to intense press interest for more than a decade, ever since the publication of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the first Harry Potter book. She also complained of door-stepping, pursuit by paparazzi, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the unjustified publication of details of her private life and that of her family.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup> Ms Rowling</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained that shortly after the publication of the first Harry Potter book, she was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;literally</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">driven out of the first house [she] had ever owned (which faced almost directly onto the street)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">because of journalists banging on the door, questioning the neighbours and sitting in parked</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cars immediately outside the gate&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-12"><a href="#para2-12" name="para2-12">2.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Rowling&#8217;s primary complaints related to the privacy of her family and the privacy of her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">home: an assessment of her evidence shows that parts of the press have shown indifference</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to, or disrespect for, both.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In respect of her children, Ms Rowling has been consistent and clear since she first came</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to public attention that she did not want her children exposed to public view. There can be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no doubt that the press has been fully aware of her stance. She has refused requests to be</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographed with her children for publicity purposes, she has avoided taking her children to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any events where photographers are likely to be present, and she has refused to discuss her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">children in interviews. Where photographs of her children have been published, she and her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">husband have taken legal and other action to prevent republication.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-14"><a href="#para2-14" name="para2-14">2.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nonetheless, Ms Rowling&#8217;s evidence suggested that parts of the press have shown a casual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disregard of her desire to protect her children&#8217;s privacy. Ms Rowling provided numerous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examples to illustrate the point. In 1998, after she had refused requests to allow photographs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of her daughter, press photographers began to gather outside her home in an attempt to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">take such photos.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup> Periodically, over the following decade, photographers continued to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">congregate outside her home and to pursue her, and her family, in the UK and abroad.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In 2001, OK! magazine published a photograph of her eight year old daughter in a bikini, while</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on a secluded beach in Mauritius. The photograph, taken with a long lens camera, led to a PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adjudication, in her favour, that Ms Rowling hoped would lead to a change in the behaviour</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of press photographers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup> Instead, she recalled no change at all. In 2003, after the birth of</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">largely confined herself to her house and, on the occasions where she left the house, would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cover her daughter in a blanket to preserve her privacy.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup> Despite her efforts at this time,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intrusive photographs of her son and daughter were both taken and published.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-16"><a href="#para2-16" name="para2-16">2.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In 2005, after a photograph of her 18 month old son was taken with a long lens and published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the Sunday Express, Ms Rowling issued proceedings against Express Newspapers Limited</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the photo-agency responsible for the photograph, Big Pictures Limited. After lengthy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">litigation, the Court of Appeal found that the taking and publication of the photographs were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an arguable breach of his Ms Rowling&#8217;s son&#8217;s right to private life.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup> But in the period between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issuing the claim and receiving judgment from the Court of Appeal, other titles continued</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to take and publish intrusive photographs of her children: the Daily Mirror published a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photograph of her daughter as a baby,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup> and The Sun and the Daily Mail published long-lens</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographs of her three children, taken while the family were on holiday in the USA.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-17"><a href="#para2-17" name="para2-17">2.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Clause 6 of the PCC Code requires editors not to use the fame, notoriety or position of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parent or guardian as sole justification for publishing details of a child&#8217;s private life, but it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appears that in the case of Ms Rowling&#8217;s children, this was the only justification for the pursuit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and publication of their photos. In the same way as Ms Church objected, in particular, to her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">career choice impacting on the privacy of her parents, Ms Rowling objected to her fame</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impacting on the privacy of her children. She said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Any other 18 month old child can expect to be pushed along the street in their buggy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">without the paparazzi taking surreptitious photographs of them for the purpose of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">publication in a national newspaper. I have to question why the position should be</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any different for my son. The only difference that exists is that my son has a mother</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who is well known and is of interest to the press.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-18"><a href="#para2-18" name="para2-18">2.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Rowling explained the impact on her children of more than a decade&#8217;s intrusion by press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographers as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The actions of the paparazzi have had a real impact on my children. My eldest</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">daughter regularly became upset at being accosted in this way and, as is the way</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">when a child sees his or her parents upset, was also upset because I was upset. The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">requirement to hide under blankets in cars so as not to be photographed was also</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">very unsettling and stressful for her. As for my son, despite being just less than two</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">years old at the time of the litigation concerning him, he was confused by the constant</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">presence of photographers outside his home and unsettled by the tension of the adults</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">around him, in particular as they tried to shield him from being photographed&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Rowling&#8217;s complaints about harassment by paparazzi and other press photographers were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">echoed by several other witnesses to the Inquiry; their evidence is dealt with in more detail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">below. However Ms Rowling&#8217;s complaints were not limited to photographers. Journalists too</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">more disconcerting examples provided, a journalist arranged for a letter, addressed to Ms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rowling, to be placed in her five year old daughter&#8217;s schoolbag.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup> Ms Rowling&#8217;s response was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one of justifiable anger at the invasion of her daughter&#8217;s privacy.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-20"><a href="#para2-20" name="para2-20">2.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Rowling&#8217;s second significant complaint related to the publication of details of her address</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and private information about her home, with apparently no regard for the consequences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of such publication, and no regard for any public interest in doing so. In January 2005, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Scottish Daily Mail published the full address of Ms Rowling&#8217;s Scottish property.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup> In July 2005,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Daily Mirror published the street names and photographs of three of her properties in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">England and Scotland, and published the locations, and details, of security features that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been installed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup> Understandably concerned by the publication of information that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not only private, but which also jeopardised the security of her home, Ms Rowling&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">representatives complained to the PCC. The complaint was upheld in part.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-21"><a href="#para2-21" name="para2-21">2.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In 2007, the Daily Mirror, the Daily Record, and the Scottish Mail on Sunday published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographs and information about Ms Rowling&#8217;s Scottish home, including descriptions of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the property, sufficient to identify its precise location.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup> Once again, Ms Rowling complained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the PCC. That complaint was rejected on the grounds that the information published was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">already available in the public domain.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup> It is not necessary to revisit that ruling here, but it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">notable that in considering the complaint, the PCC apparently gave no consideration to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest in the further publication of this information, and it is difficult to see what real</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justification there might be.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-22"><a href="#para2-22" name="para2-22">2.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the context of Ms Rowling&#8217;s clear and unambiguous desire for privacy, and where Ms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rowling had previously had a complaint upheld for the publication of very similar material,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the decision of some titles to publish information which revealed her address, demonstrates</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what appears to be a casual disregard for her privacy, and a carelessness with regard to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consequences of publishing private information. It is consistent with the evidence in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to her attempts to protect the privacy of her children: with regard to both the privacy of her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">children and her home, sections of the press chose to ignore the fact that she had consistently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and unequivocally sought to protect her privacy.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-23"><a href="#para2-23" name="para2-23">2.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence provided by the actor Steve Coogan shed further light on a tendency within</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sections of the press to treat individuals without dignity or respect. Mr Coogan has a personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">life which, by his own admission, may not command the moral approval of all.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup> However, his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence was that he had never sought to set himself up as a &#8220;model of morality&#8221;, nor had he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sought fame as such. Instead, he has pursued a career as a comedian, writer, and actor and it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is that choice alone which has brought him into the public eye.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup> While it may be correct that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some people in the public eye trade on their wholesome image or status as a family man, that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is not the case with Mr Coogan.</span>

 <p id="para-id-2-24"><a href="#para2-24" name="para2-24">2.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Despite this, sections of the press have treated his private life as fair game for publication. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been the subject of numerous &#8220;kiss and tell&#8221; stories and lurid exposes. In 1996, the Daily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mirror published two such stories, having paid a woman with whom he was having an affair</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to &#8220;tell all&#8221;. While investigating the stories, journalists door-stepped the pregnant mother of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his child and door-stepped, or otherwise harassed, several members of his family. Shortly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">afterwards, in relation to a similar story, a journalist from the same title called the great-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">grandmother of his daughter asking her to &#8220;spill the beans&#8221; about Mr Coogan&#8217;s relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with her granddaughter.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-25"><a href="#para2-25" name="para2-25">2.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One example provided by Mr Coogan of the methods used to expose these stories was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particularly notable. In 2002, Rav Singh, a casual friend of Mr Coogan&#8217;s and a journalist at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW phoned Mr Coogan to warn him of a proposed NoTW sting. Mr Coogan was told that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he was to receive a phone call from a woman with whom Mr Coogan was acquainted, and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">woman would seek to persuade Mr Coogan to disclose intimate details of his life. However,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the woman would be calling from the office of the editor of the NoTW with the intention of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publishing the details of the conversation. Having been tipped off, Mr Coogan did not disclose</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any intimate details during that conversation. However, two years later Mr Singh called him</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to &#8220;negotiate&#8221; an article to be published the following day about another of Mr Coogan&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intimate relationships. Mr Singh offered to omit certain more embarrassing parts of the story</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if Mr Coogan admitted and discussed other aspects. Trusting Mr Singh&#8217;s integrity after his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2002 experience, Mr Coogan did discuss the relationship in some detail with Mr Singh.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-26"><a href="#para2-26" name="para2-26">2.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At the end of the conversation, however, the editor of the NoTW called Mr Coogan&#8217;s publicist</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to inform him that the entire conversation had been recorded and all of the details disclosed</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be published, including those that Mr Singh had agreed not to publish. As Mr Coogan</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">noted, the promises not to publish certain elements of the story appeared to have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offered simply to induce Mr Coogan to reveal even more about the story.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup> Mr Coogan&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expressed his view of the incident as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it was a malicious personal vendetta against me. My feeling is that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it was a dispassionate sociopathic act by those who operate in an amoral universe</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">where they are never accountable.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-27"><a href="#para2-27" name="para2-27">2.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">No clear public interest justification has been offered for the many stories published about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coogan&#8217;s sex life. The stories are mere tittle-tattle. But as Mr Coogan noted, such gossip</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is not necessarily harmless and, even when true, can be extremely damaging to the parties</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involved, as well as innocent third parties.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup> When untrue, for instance in the case of the Daily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mail&#8217;s report that Mr Coogan was responsible for the attempted suicide of another actor,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such invasions of private life can be extremely damaging indeed;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup> this is dealt with in more</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">their relationship, unless he paid her a sum of money. In essence, Mr Flitcroft says he was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">blackmailed, but refused to pay the woman any money and as a consequence she sold her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story to the People.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-30"><a href="#para2-30" name="para2-30">2.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Flitcroft sought an injunction to prevent publication. It is not necessary to review the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lengthy litigation which ensued, save to say that the Court of Appeal lifted an injunction</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">initially imposed by the High Court on the grounds that, in all the circumstances of the case,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">freedom of the press should prevail over Mr Flitcroft&#8217;s right to private life.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup> It is not for this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry to review the rights or wrongs of that judgment<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup> but what is of interest is first, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conduct of the People during the course of the litigation and second, the apparent lack of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consideration of the consequences of publication on Mr Flitcroft and his family by those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsible for publication.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-31"><a href="#para2-31" name="para2-31">2.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As to the first, the People responded to the interim injunction granted by the High Court</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by conducting what seems to have been an investigative exercise into other aspects of Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Flitcroft&#8217;s private life. As Mr Flitcroft noted,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> seemed</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> details</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> my</span><span style="font-style:italic"> affair&#8230;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> were</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> huge</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">affair and, after Mr Flitcroft declined to pay the woman involved &#163;5,000 not to disclose</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her story, she sold her story to the People.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup> Additionally, although the interim injunction</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prevented publication of the story, Mr Flitcroft recalled that the People published sufficient</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">details of the original story to spark intense speculation as to which Premiership footballer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was the subject of the story. Rumour, and leaks from sports journalists, led many people to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclude the story was about Mr Flitcroft long before the story was published.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-32"><a href="#para2-32" name="para2-32">2.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whether the revelation of Mr Flitcroft&#8217;s identity was deliberate or not, and whether or not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the People&#8217;s further investigations were part of a &#8220;dirt digging&#8221; exercise as suspected by Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Flitcroft, the response of the newspaper to Mr Flitcroft&#8217;s attempt to prevent publication does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at least appear to have been consistent with a practice identified later in this Report whereby</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parts of the press seek to intimidate, attack or punish those who challenge the right of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press to publish what they choose.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">When the injunction was lifted by the Court of Appeal, publication of the story by the People</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hadadevastatingeffectonthelivesofMrFlitcroftandhisfamily.Between20and25journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and photographers congregated outside Mr and Mrs Flitcroft&#8217;s home. Other journalists went</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the homes of other family members, including that of Mrs Flitcroft&#8217;s father who was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suffering from Parkinson&#8217;s disease and who found the episode extremely distressing.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup> In the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">months that followed, Mrs Flitcroft was forced to stop taking her children to school to avoid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists and photographers while on the school run. Mr and Mrs Flitcroft&#8217;s marriage broke</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">down.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup> Mr Flitcroft said that, even today, his children suffer teasing and abuse in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the stories.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-34"><a href="#para2-34" name="para2-34">2.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">According to Mr Flitcroft, the impact on his father was catastrophic. A long term sufferer of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">depression, he found it very difficult to deal with the press coverage about his son. Having</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attended every football match since his son was aged seven, he stopped going to football</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matches to avoid the humiliation of listening to the chants and mockery from other fans.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Flitcroft believed that his failure to attend football matches after the publication of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story was a significant factor in the worsening of his depression, which tragically ended in his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suicide in 2008.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref49" href="#footnote49">49</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-35"><a href="#para2-35" name="para2-35">2.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These facts are important because they provide an insight into the personal consequences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of what is often described as &#8220;tittle tattle&#8221; and often thought of as &#8220;harmless fun&#8221;. The risk</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of such personal consequences should not necessarily prevent publication, but it should,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at least, require a degree of thought before publication. The evidence provided by former</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">People editor, Neil Wallis, suggested that there was no genuine consideration of the potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consequences of publication on the lives of Mr Flitcroft and his family. When pressed on the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">factors which were considered prior to publication, Mr Wallis was unable to recall any of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specific factors, other than the fact that Mr Flitcroft was a footballer and therefore a role</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">model. He repeatedly played down the significance of the story, saying that it was &#8220;not a big</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup> But that misses the point.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-36"><a href="#para2-36" name="para2-36">2.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A run-of-the-mill &#8220;kiss and tell&#8221; may not be a big story to a newspaper, but it will always be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a big story to the subjects of the story and their families. Although Mr Wallis implied that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication had beneficial consequences for Mrs Flitcroft because it resulted in her discovery</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of her husband&#8217;s affair,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">51</a></sup> his comment only reinforced the view that no proper consideration</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been given, before or after publication, to the real consequences of publishing the story.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mrs Flitcroft did discover her husband&#8217;s affair, but in the gaze of the tabloid press, hounded by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographers, and forced to hide from public. It is difficult to believe that she would thank</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the newspaper for its service.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-37"><a href="#para2-37" name="para2-37">2.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further examples of this cultural indifference, within sections of the press, to the dignity and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privacy of individuals were provided by the actor Hugh Grant. Over almost two decades, Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Grant&#8217;s private life has been the subject of intense press scrutiny. He has been a victim of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">defamation, phone hacking and harassment by journalists and paparazzi, issues which are</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">dealt with in more detail at various places elsewhere. In addition, newspapers have published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his private medical information: in 1996, the Daily Mirror published a report of his visit to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Charing Cross hospital, and cited his condition and treatment;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref52" href="#footnote52">52</a></sup> in March 2011, both The Sun</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the Express published details of Mr Grant&#8217;s visit to Chelsea and Westminster hospital,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and they too reported the treatment he received.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup> In neither case was there any public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest in publishing this private medical information.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-38"><a href="#para2-38" name="para2-38">2.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Consistent with the complaints made by other witnesses, Mr Grant noted that it is not only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">him, styled by the press as a celebrity, who is affected by the intrusive attentions of the press:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his girlfriends and their children have also been affected.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref54" href="#footnote54">54</a></sup> When his then girlfriend&#8217;s father</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">died in 1996, two journalists who had never met the deceased man turned up at the funeral,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">presumably looking for a story about Mr Grant but claiming to want to &#8220;pay their respects.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref55" href="#footnote55">55</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Most recently, after the birth of his child to Tinglan Hong, the new mother experienced quite</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extraordinary levels of harassment by press and paparazzi. Ms Hong feared for her own safety</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that of her child and, despite Mr Grant&#8217;s pleas, the harassment continued until the High</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Court issued an injunction preventing photographers from congregating near her house.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-39"><a href="#para2-39" name="para2-39">2.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The justification for the press intrusion Mr Grant has experienced over the last two decades</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is unclear. Gordon Smart, the showbiz editor of The Sun, told the Inquiry that the fact of Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Grant&#8217;s celebrity alone justified the publication of his private medical information.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref56" href="#footnote56">56</a></sup> It was a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">surprising approach, which revealed a lack of respect for the privacy of anyone who might be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered a celebrity. Paul Dacre, the editor in chief of the Daily Mail, put it another way in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">claiming that Mr Grant<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;had</span><span style="font-style:italic"> spent</span><span style="font-style:italic"> his</span><span style="font-style:italic"> life</span><span style="font-style:italic"> invading</span><span style="font-style:italic"> his</span><span style="font-style:italic"> own</span><span style="font-style:italic"> privacy,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> exposing</span><span style="font-style:italic"> every</span><span style="font-style:italic"> intimate</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">detail of his life&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref57" href="#footnote57">57</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> While</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> did</span><span style="font-style:normal"> not</span><span style="font-style:normal"> go</span><span style="font-style:normal"> so</span><span style="font-style:normal"> far</span><span style="font-style:normal"> as</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> suggest</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Grant&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:normal"> private</span><span style="font-style:normal"> life</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">therefore &#8220;open season&#8221;, he did imply that, as a consequence of Mr Grant&#8217;s public disclosures</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of elements of his private life, the press could, with justification, investigate and report on his</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">private life in significant detail. But there are real problems with that reasoning as well.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-40"><a href="#para2-40" name="para2-40">2.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, although Mr Grant is an actor, and is by the nature of his career in the public eye, he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does not appear to have courted celebrity or fame as some actors have. Indeed, his evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was that he had given only two interviews to British newspapers in the last 17 years and did</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not employ a publicist in the UK.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref58" href="#footnote58">58</a></sup> Although he accepted that he had spoken publicly about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his desire to have a child, and had made remarks to the effect that he understands the public&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest in the personal lives of actors, the evidence provided to the Inquiry did not, in my</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view, support the conclusion that Mr Grant had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> spent</span><span style="font-style:italic"> his</span><span style="font-style:italic"> life</span><span style="font-style:italic"> invading</span><span style="font-style:italic"> his</span><span style="font-style:italic"> own</span><span style="font-style:italic"> privacy</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-41"><a href="#para2-41" name="para2-41">2.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Instead, the evidence revealed an actor who had, on occasion (mostly, but not entirely,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the course of interviews he was contractually bound to provide in order to satisfy the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publicity requirements of the films in which he appeared), spoken about his personal life in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a generally flippant or humorous manner, sometimes exposing a little more of himself than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on other occasions. Unsurprisingly, he had also attended public events with girlfriends, and</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">so-called &#8216;celebrities&#8217; could legitimately be accused of that. In Chapter 1 of this Part of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Report, I acknowledged that there is a class of person with a public profile &#8211; those who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">actively engage in the &#8216;celebrity industry&#8217; &#8211; who may enjoy a lower level of protection when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it comes to privacy. I also accept, and fully recognise, that a substantial amount of celebrity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reporting in the popular press concerns this class of people. However, in my view at least, Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Grant does not fall within that class.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-42"><a href="#para2-42" name="para2-42">2.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, even if it were true that Mr Grant had previously disclosed a multitude of genuinely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private details about his life, or had sold stories of his private life to particular titles, it does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not necessarily follow that he would be &#8220;fair game&#8221; for the press at large to publish further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">details without consent. As Mr Grant put it:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I have heard the defence quite frequently from tabloid papers: &#8220;Oh, well, you know,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">if you have ever talked about your private life, then you have no defence, you have no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">right to an expectation of privacy&#8221;, which I think is absurd. Because anyone &#8211; I mean,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as I told you earlier, I think I&#8217;ve only done two interviews ever with the British press,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but when anyone does do an interview, it is, after all, a bargain. The press of that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">paper gets a boost in sales, they hope, and the person who&#8217;s giving the interview gets</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a bit of noise about their forthcoming project. And like any barter, when it&#8217;s over, it&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">over. If I sell you a pint of milk for 50p, I would not expect you to come to me forever</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">afterwards, saying, &#8220;You slut, you sold me milk once. I can now help myself to your</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">milk forever.&#8221; I would think you were mad.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-43"><a href="#para2-43" name="para2-43">2.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, even if Mr Grant can have no reasonable expectation of privacy himself, that does not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justify the collateral damage to, or the harassment of, and intrusion into the private lives of,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those close to him.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-44"><a href="#para2-44" name="para2-44">2.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Again, it seems that the intrusive reporting that Mr Grant spoke of is part of a cultural</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indifference within parts of the press to individual privacy and dignity. That manifests itself</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">most frequently in the celebrity press, where individual private lives are treated, at least to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some extent, as commodities. The evidence given by Miss Church, Ms Rowling, Mr Coogan</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Mr Grant support this conclusion, as does the similar evidence heard by the Inquiry from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sienna Miller,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref61" href="#footnote61">61</a></sup> Sheryl Gascoigne,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref62" href="#footnote62">62</a></sup> Anne Diamond<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref63" href="#footnote63">63</a></sup> and Heather Mills.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref64" href="#footnote64">64</a></sup> But the cultural</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indifference to privacy and dignity does not apply only to celebrities or those in the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">eye. In addition to the experiences described by the Dowlers, the McCanns and Christopher</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Jefferies, the Inquiry heard evidence from, or about, numerous others who were not public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">figures but who had experienced seriously intrusive coverage and/or treatment from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">press.</span>

 <p id="para-id-2-45"><a href="#para2-45" name="para2-45">2.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence provided by HJK, discussed in Chapter 3 above, was a prime example of this.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">So too was the evidence of Baroness Hollins. In 2005, Baroness Hollins&#8217; daughter Abigail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Witchall, a private individual with no public persona, was stabbed and critically injured: she</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was a victim of crime, pure and simple. Although the majority of the press covered the story in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a compassionate and sensitive way, a section of the press behaved irresponsibly and without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regard to the privacy and dignity of the family.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-46"><a href="#para2-46" name="para2-46">2.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the first day after the attack, a group of journalists congregated in the family garden,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">before being required to leave by police. Other journalists camped outside the hospital</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where Abigail was undergoing treatment, or pretended to be visitors in the waiting room.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref65" href="#footnote65">65</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The intrusion and surveillance continued: a year later, a long lens photograph was published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in The Sun of the entire family, while on a private pilgrimage to Lourdes;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref66" href="#footnote66">66</a></sup> even in 2010,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when Abigail had given birth to another baby, Daily Mail reporters were stationed outside her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">house on a shift pattern waiting for sight of Abigail or the baby.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref67" href="#footnote67">67</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-47"><a href="#para2-47" name="para2-47">2.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The family also endured the publication of intimate and private details. Reporting on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">incident, the NoTW published the headline, &#8220;Exclusive: new shock in Abi attack &#8211; knife mum</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was pregnant&#8221;. While accurate, the truth was that Abigail was only five weeks pregnant and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was unaware of the fact. She had certainly not consented to the publication of the fact of her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pregnancy and it appears no family member had done so either.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref68" href="#footnote68">68</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-48"><a href="#para2-48" name="para2-48">2.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The experience described by Baroness Hollins in relation to the reporting of her daughter&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attackwasechoedbyevidencegiventotheInquirybyseveralotherwitnesseswhocomplained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a breach of privacy and harassment in the aftermath of a death or attack; that evidence is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered in more detail at Section 6 below.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-49"><a href="#para2-49" name="para2-49">2.49</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry also received evidence about a series of stories published in the NoTW about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Bob and Sue Firth. Their evidence was that they ran a naturist B&B in Dorset, which had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been anonymously inspected by the English Tourist Board and rated as highly commended.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Shortly after receiving that rating, the NoTW journalist, Neville Thurlbeck, orchestrated an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undercover sting operation and reported that the Firths were running not just a naturist B&B,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but a brothel at which Sue Firth would have sex with guests while Bob Firth looked on.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref69" href="#footnote69">69</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-50"><a href="#para2-50" name="para2-50">2.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Firths&#8217; evidence was that there was no truth in the story. At no stage had Sue Firth engaged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in sexual activity with guests, and sexual activity was no part of the naturist element of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">B&B.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref70" href="#footnote70">70</a></sup> However, they claimed that Mr Thurlbeck had entrapped them: he had cajoled and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">paid the Firths to perform a sex act while Mr Thurlbeck looked on. On their evidence, that had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only happened as a consequence of Mr Thurlbeck&#8217;s entrapment and had never previously, or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subsequently, occurred at the B&B. Nonetheless, as a consequence of the articles published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the NoTW, the Firths were forced to close the B&B.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref71" href="#footnote71">71</a></sup></span>

 <p id="para-id-2-51"><a href="#para2-51" name="para2-51">2.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thurlbeck was given an opportunity to comment on the Firths&#8217; evidence but declined,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">instead relying on a PCC ruling that had found the story to be &#8220;justified&#8221; in the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref72" href="#footnote72">72</a></sup> That ruling is available but, to say the least, is opaque at best. No doubt on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">basis that the PCC is not set up to resolve issues of fact, it makes no finding on the Firths&#8217; core</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaint that much of the story was fabricated. Without making that decision, however,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC considered itself able to reach a finding on the public interest of the story. But if it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was fabricated, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to decide that there was any public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest in it. Despite being pressed to explain the public interest in the story, Mr Thurlbeck</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">simply refused to do so.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-52"><a href="#para2-52" name="para2-52">2.52</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It was clear from the evidence of Tom Crone, the legal advisor at the NoTW at the time,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that Mr Thurlbeck neither requested nor received any advice on the public interest of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story before engaging in the subterfuge, nor did he request or receive such advice prior to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref73" href="#footnote73">73</a></sup> Mr Crone&#8217;s evidence to the Inquiry was that the story was tacky and the breach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of privacy involved was not justified.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref74" href="#footnote74">74</a></sup> The fact that the newspaper&#8217;s own lawyer considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the breach of privacy was not in the public interest is revealing, as is the fact that nobody</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thought it appropriate to ask him in the first place.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-53"><a href="#para2-53" name="para2-53">2.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Overall, and notwithstanding the concerns which have been expressed, it would not be right</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to reach any further conclusions on the Firth story, for a number of reasons. It occurred a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considerable time ago now, and the evidence is both murky and heavily disputed. The Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">received a witness statement from the Firths but it was not tested in oral evidence. To have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">done so would have occupied a disproportionate amount of Inquiry time in circumstances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where Mr Thurlbeck had already made clear that he would refuse to give his account of this</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">story. Given that he had been arrested in connection with alleged phone hacking offences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the summer of 2011 (and has since been charged), it would have been difficult to compel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">him to engage with the Inquiry on these issues, and probably unnecessary. Notwithstanding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all these caveats, it is possible, at least tentatively, to conclude that prior to publication, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW had insufficient regard to the privacy of the Firths or the consequences of publication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on their lives.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-54"><a href="#para2-54" name="para2-54">2.54</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Assessed as a whole, the examples referred to so far in this Chapter (including those merely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">footnoted) suggest a culture of indifference to individual privacy and dignity, at least within</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parts of the press. But the evidence supporting that conclusion is not limited to this section,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and can be seen throughout the Chapter: the evidence of phone hacking, email hacking,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">blagging, harassment and surveillance all lead to the same conclusion.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-55"><a href="#para2-55" name="para2-55">2.55</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Evidence by lawyers who represent victims of privacy intrusion also supported that same</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusion. Graham Shear, a partner at law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner, told the Inquiry that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the last 15 years tabloid newspapers had specifically targeted celebrities and sportsmen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to generate front page expos&#233;s.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref75" href="#footnote75">75</a></sup> The use of surveillance, subterfuge, or the payment of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an agent provocateur had increased in what he considered was a response to commercial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressures which required sensationalist exposes to generate sales.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref76" href="#footnote76">76</a></sup> His evidence was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">supported by solicitor Mark Thomson who considered that, since the late 1980s, there had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> widespread</span><span style="font-style:italic"> culture</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> illegal</span><span style="font-style:italic"> obtaining</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> use</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> private</span><span style="font-style:italic"> information</span><span style="font-style:italic"> by</span><span style="font-style:italic"> popular</span></span>

<p id="para-id-2-56"><a href="#para2-56" name="para2-56">2.56</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Shear&#8217;s evidence was that the increasingly intrusive techniques used by parts of the tabloid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press to generate increasingly sensational stories were the result less of an indifference to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private lives and reputation, and more the result of a calculation of the financial risk of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privacy or defamation claim against the potential profits that a story might generate. On that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">basis, he considered that some titles would publish stories likely to result in a substantial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">increase in circulation, notwithstanding that the story was likely to be an unlawful invasion of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privacy, or even defamatory.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref79" href="#footnote79">79</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-57"><a href="#para2-57" name="para2-57">2.57</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is some further evidence of unethical or unlawful publication based on the calculation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of legal risk versus potential profits. For example, Piers Morgan recollected in his book<span style="font-style:italic"> The</span></span>

<p id="para-id-2-58"><a href="#para2-58" name="para2-58">2.58</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, although there is material to suggest that financial calculations play a part in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">willingness of parts of the press to use intrusive investigative techniques or to publish stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involving egregious breaches of privacy, it is not clear that most of the complaints made by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">victims of these practices can be explained by a calculated approach to assessing financial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">risk against potential profit. Instead, it seems more likely that, in the majority of cases of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unjustified invasions of privacy, the simple fact is that the privacy and dignity of subjects of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories are not considered at all or, alternatively, are not sufficiently weighed in the balance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prior to investigating or publishing the story.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-59"><a href="#para2-59" name="para2-59">2.59</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence heard from some editors, journalists and executives supported that view. At its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extreme, the cultural indifference to privacy was encapsulated in Paul McMullan&#8217;s observation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;privacy</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span><span style="font-style:italic"> paedos&#8230;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> no-one</span><span style="font-style:italic"> else</span><span style="font-style:italic"> needs</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> evil.&#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref81" href="#footnote81">81</a></sup> While others may not have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expressed themselves in the same terms, there seemed to be at least some agreement from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other editors and journalists that privacy was not a matter worthy of significant protection.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-60"><a href="#para2-60" name="para2-60">2.60</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Kelvin MacKenzie recalled that, as editor of The Sun, he did not have any regard to issues of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privacy.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref82" href="#footnote82">82</a></sup> He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref83" href="#footnote83">83</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t spend too much time pondering the ethics of how a story was gained, nor</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">over-worry about whether to publish or not. If we believed the story to be true and we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">felt Sun readers should know the facts, we published it and left it to them to decide if</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although Mr MacKenzie left the Sun in 1994 and his evidence cannot necessarily be taken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as reflecting attitudes prevailing today, his views chimed with Mr McMullan&#8217;s, and were not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dissimilar to some of the views expressed by proprietors, editors and journalists.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-62"><a href="#para2-62" name="para2-62">2.62</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As previously noted, the proprietor of the Express Group, Richard Desmond gave evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that his newspapers<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;are</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> business</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> give</span><span style="font-style:italic"> readers/viewers</span><span style="font-style:italic"> what</span><span style="font-style:italic"> they</span><span style="font-style:italic"> want</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> read</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">watch and as long as it is legal that is what we aim to do. We do not talk about ethics or morals</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">because it&#8217;s a very fine line, and everybody&#8217;s ethics are different.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref84" href="#footnote84">84</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Desmond</span><span style="font-style:normal"> said</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bottom line for whether or not to publish a story was the reputation of his newspapers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref85" href="#footnote85">85</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-63"><a href="#para2-63" name="para2-63">2.63</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That approach from the proprietor may or may not have influenced the thinking of the editor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Daily Express, Peter Hill, when considering whether to publish 38 defamatory and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intrusive stories about the McCanns. Mr Hill&#8217;s evidence to the Inquiry betrayed a distinct lack</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of consideration for the dignity and privacy of the McCanns, and showed instead a focus on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the circulation of his newspaper.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref86" href="#footnote86">86</a></sup> Despite his knowledge that his reporters on the ground in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Portugal had very real concerns about the truth of the articles they were writing, Mr Hill told</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry that he was not troubled by the decision to publish because, in his view, there was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a clamour for information about the Madeleine McCann story and his readers wanted to read</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about it.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref87" href="#footnote87">87</a></sup> His evidence suggested a remarkable elision between what was justified in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest, and what would interest his readership. Such elision leaves little room for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protection of privacy if a readership is interested in reading about the private lives of others.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-64"><a href="#para2-64" name="para2-64">2.64</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">But Mr Hill was not alone in holding a conception of the public interest that was essentially</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">defined by what interested the readership. The then editor of the Sunday Mirror, Tina Weaver,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">confirmed that her view was that the public interest test was often drawn too narrowly by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">courts and the PCC and that the public were ultimately the best barometer of what was in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest. She confirmed that her approach came close to equating the public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with what interested the public, although she denied that there was a complete overlap</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between the two.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref88" href="#footnote88">88</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-65"><a href="#para2-65" name="para2-65">2.65</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">The Daily Express&#8217;s Hugh Whittow and the Daily Star&#8217;s Dawn Neesom considered the readers&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">views to be a primary factor in the consideration of whether to publish private information.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref89" href="#footnote89">89</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Similarly, the Daily Mirror&#8217;s then editor Richard Wallace thought the public interest was very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strongly influenced by what interests the public. In the context of the Christopher Jefferies</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story, he said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref90" href="#footnote90">90</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;What the public are interested in is a central tenet of public interest. The public were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interested in this story&#8230; Acting within the framework of the PCC Code, I considered</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">publishing these stories to be in the public interest because the public wanted to read</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about the story.&#8221;</span>

 <p id="para-id-2-66"><a href="#para2-66" name="para2-66">2.66</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The story about Mr Jefferies is a prime example of why the elision of the public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with what interests the public is dangerous. It may well interest the public to read private,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scandalous and defamatory material about a suspect to a murder, but it is clearly not in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wider public interest for newspapers to act in contempt of court, let alone erroneously to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">destroy a man&#8217;s reputation.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-67"><a href="#para2-67" name="para2-67">2.67</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A consideration of what interests a readership must of course form the basis of any editorial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision to publish or not to publish material, but where the material involves private rights,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the decision on whether to publish must also include a consideration of the consequences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of publication on the subjects of stories and on the wider public interest. Richard Peppiatt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provided helpful evidence on this point when he noted:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref91" href="#footnote91">91</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Yesterday, Hugh Whittow, in the Commons Select Committee on Privacy, he said</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">over the Chris Jefferies case, which I thought was really cold &#8211; he said, &#8220;We make</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mistakes, we paid out, we move on.&#8221; Well, Chris Jefferies doesn&#8217;t move on. His life</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">has been irreparably changed and that is the attitude: &#8220;We make mistakes.&#8221; But no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">one wants to take responsibility for those mistakes and the reason is because there&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not an individual who you can point the finger to and say is responsible, because it&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">a culture.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-68"><a href="#para2-68" name="para2-68">2.68</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A failure to consider the personal consequences of publishing information about an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual&#8217;s private life was evident in Mr Dacre&#8217;s evidence. The Daily Mail&#8217;s coverage of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attack on Ms Witchall included an article suggesting a spurious link between Ms Witchall&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attack and one suffered by her brother some years earlier. Included as part of that article</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was the name and a photograph of Ms Witchall&#8217;s brother, an indication that he suffered</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">from learning difficulties and the names of his attackers. Baroness Hollins complained to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry that the article was an unjustified breach of her vulnerable son&#8217;s privacy, which also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">placed him at risk of reprisals from his convicted attackers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref92" href="#footnote92">92</a></sup> Mr Dacre defended the article</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">robustly:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref93" href="#footnote93">93</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Can I say as strongly as I can that this, I believe, shows how the Inquiry doesn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">understand how newspapers work. To my mind, this is a story and a feature handled</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">withsuperbsensitivity.I&#8217;vebeenthroughit.Ithinkit&#8217;swrittenwithmassivecompassion.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think the family come out of it wonderfully. The love between the brother and sister</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is extraordinary. The religious faith of the family comes across. The learning disability</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; the mother and the son wrote a book about that, on how to handle court cases for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people with learning disabilities. I think that&#8217;s a wonderful message to get out to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public. I think that was an extraordinary story.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-69"><a href="#para2-69" name="para2-69">2.69</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">While the story may well have been extraordinary, written sensitively, and may well have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contained a wonderful message, those factors do not change the fact that the story involved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the disclosure of sensitive information which caused significant upset to the family, and was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">based in large part on the spurious suggestion of a link between two obviously unlinked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attacks. I do not criticise Mr Dacre for the decision to publish the article, which he considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be justified in the public interest. He is absolutely entitled to his own view on where the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">balance between private rights and public interests lay in respect of this (and other) stories.</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">But Mr Dacre&#8217;s robust defence of the article failed to engage with the genuine concerns</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">raised by Baroness Hollins. Indeed, Mr Dacre appeared not to understand why the family</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would have been upset by the article at all.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref94" href="#footnote94">94</a></sup> Given that Mr Dacre did not engage with the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">that insufficient consideration was given to the<span style="font-style:italic"> potential</span> consequences of the story, or its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impact on the family, prior to publication.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-70"><a href="#para2-70" name="para2-70">2.70</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Dacre adopted a similarly robust approach in defending the publication of a defamatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story containing erroneous information about alleged drunken behaviour of the actor Neil</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Morrissey.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref95" href="#footnote95">95</a></sup> Mr Dacre accepted that the story was inaccurate and defamatory, but was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unwilling to accept Mr Morrissey&#8217;s evidence that the story was hurtful to him. Moreover,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he argued strongly that, if true, the story would have been in the public interest because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Morrissey was a famous actor, because the story interested his readership and because,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the time, the Daily Mail believed that Mr Morrissey had acted irresponsibly.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref96" href="#footnote96">96</a></sup> The final</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">element of that justification &#8211; irresponsible behaviour &#8211; accorded with a more general point</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which Mr Dacre accepted, that his newspaper felt justified to publish private information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about public figures when they &#8220;erred&#8221; from the traditional virtues of family life, traditional</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matrimony and traditional values.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref97" href="#footnote97">97</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-71"><a href="#para2-71" name="para2-71">2.71</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">What was concerning about Mr Dacre&#8217;s evidence on both the Ms Witchall and Mr Morrissey</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories was not his editorial judgment on whether the articles should have been published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or not. Instead, the concern related to Mr Dacre&#8217;s unwillingness to entertain the idea that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">each of these stories might have been hurtful, upsetting and/or damaging to the individuals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involved. If such a possibility is not even recognised post publication, despite evidence to the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">contrary from the subjects of the stories, then it seems unlikely to have been the subject of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any consideration pre-publication.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-72"><a href="#para2-72" name="para2-72">2.72</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As part of the body of evidence received from editors and proprietors, Mr Dacre&#8217;s evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">supported a more general conclusion that there is a cultural unwillingness in parts of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press to consider the consequences of publication on the individuals involved. Some of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence from photo-editors and photo agencies discussed in Section 5 below, also supports</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that conclusion. To reiterate the point: the fact that a story might be hurtful, damaging or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intrusive to the subjects of a story is not necessarily a reason not to publish that story. It may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not even be a reason to amend the story. But it is difficult to see why the consequences on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the individuals who are likely to be affected by publication should not both be relevant and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">factored into the overall decision.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-73"><a href="#para2-73" name="para2-73">2.73</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In part, this cultural unwillingness stems from inadequate systems for considering and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recording public interest decisions. Assessing the evidence as a whole, and as more fully</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discussed below, it appears that, until recently, in house legal advisors were rarely asked to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advise on privacy issues at all, but focused almost exclusively on libel. Although legal advisors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are now asked to advise on privacy issues more regularly, the final decision on publication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(rightly) rests with the editorial team. It appears that, in the majority of titles, there is no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">formal system in place for that team to consider, decide and minute the difficult questions of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether publication of private information is in the public interest. Those titles that do have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such systems have only introduced them very recently.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although some witnesses feared the bureaucratic burden that such systems might impose,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those fears are surely misplaced. Only a few stories raise issues of this nature and a single</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">page record of the factors weighing against and in favour of publication, along with a record of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the reasons for the conclusion reached, would suffice and be no more than many editors said</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reflected their thought processes. The adoption of such a system for reaching public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decisions is, however, important for two main reasons. First, such decision-making process</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">focuses the mind and ensures that all relevant factors, including the privacy and dignity of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the individual, as well as the potential consequences of, and public interest in, publication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are properly considered. The second reason is that a formal, written decision making process</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can assist titles defending subsequent complaints or litigation, where the absence of any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contemporaneous record of decision can result in accusations of ex post facto reasoning to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justify what was in reality an unconsidered interference with private life.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-75"><a href="#para2-75" name="para2-75">2.75</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This approach may well cause Mr Dacre to consider that his expressed view (that the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does not understand how newspapers work) is proved, but it is important to make the point</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that both the approach and the reasons underlying it rely only on the law of privacy as it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been explained by the courts and on the standards identified by the press themselves</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expressed through the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice. Newspapers have to work within the law and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if the Code does not represent the way in which newspapers carry out their business, then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the high regard which editors have for it is misplaced.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-76"><a href="#para2-76" name="para2-76">2.76</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although significant improvements can and should be made (and in many cases, have already</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been made) to internal systems for considering and recording public interest decisions,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">systemic changes alone will not address the real issues identified above. In my view, parts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press require a cultural, rather than a systemic, change to ensure that the privacy and</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">dignity of individuals is appropriately respected, and to ensure that the public interest in,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and consequences of, and publication are considered when titles decide how and whether to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigate, and publish, details of individuals&#8217; private lives.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-77"><a href="#para2-77" name="para2-77">2.77</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The need for such a change in culture is all the more urgent in a technological age which allows</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for unprecedented access to private information and unprecedented means to distribute that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private information. As the Media Standards Trust noted:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref98" href="#footnote98">98</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In the constrained media environment of the twentieth century there were practical</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">limitations on the press&#8217; ability to report on people&#8217;s private lives. There was, for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">example, only a limited amount of material the press could access &#8211; in terms of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">photographs, video, phone conversations etc. There were also practical constraints</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on what the papers could and could not publish. They were not able to publish video</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or audio, and they could only publish as much as could fit between the front and back</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pages of the print paper.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">For the most part these practical constraints no longer exist. The press &#8211; or anyone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">else &#8211; can access huge amounts of personal material themselves and through others.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A reporter can legitimately find personal information published on the internet or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">source recorded audio/video from members of the public. Equally, a reporter can</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">illegitimately access private material or illicitly record personal moments or private</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">phone calls. The papers can then publish as much of this material as they like &#8211; in text,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">audio, or video &#8211; online. Or anyone else can publish this information, on a website, on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a blog, on a social networking site like Facebook, on twitter, on a wiki. The information</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">can then ripple rapidly outwards across the net.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In this context, it is vital that the press in general develops, and/or maintains, internal cultures</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in which respect for individual privacy and dignity is central, without impacting adversely on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">genuine investigative journalism. In the absence of such cultures, the temptation to use the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">technology that is now available to invade privacy and to publish private information, when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not in the public interest, may be irresistible. It is to the evidence on the use of some of those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">technologies which I now turn.</span>

<h2>3.  Unlawful or unethical acquisition of private  information</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This Chapter will now explore the evidence heard by the Inquiry in relation to the practices of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press in obtaining private information, the extent to which these practices could properly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be described as &#8216;cultural&#8217; rather than sporadic or isolated incidents, and the extent to which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those working in the media industry were aware that these practices were occurring.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The practices under consideration are known colloquially in the industry as the &#8216;dark arts&#8217;,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although this term no doubt goes wider than the unlawful and unethical acquisition of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private information. The Inquiry received evidence of a general nature about these practices</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from witnesses such as Nick Davies from the Guardian.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref99" href="#footnote99">99</a></sup> The witness statement of Michelle</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Stanistreet, and her exhibits containing anonymous testimony, included evidence from one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalist who had experienced the practices of the dark arts across a range of mid-market,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">tabloid and broadsheet newspapers, and had himself worked with a private investigator on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a number of stories.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The witness explained to Ms Stanistreet that investigators could provide surveillance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">services including bugging homes and offices and recording landline phones, Police National</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Computer (PNC) checks to learn about criminal convictions and cautions, and could find up</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to date addresses. These services were provided in return for cash delivered in rolled up</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers by journalists. This evidence recalled that, initially, the use of such techniques</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not widespread in newsrooms but was restricted at that time to a few journalists who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;had an investigative bent&#8221;. However at another title, methods of obtaining information were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">talked about more openly and, in relation to two titles where the witness had worked, there</span>

<h3>Phone</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This topic has been addressed in other sections of the Report . However, for reasons of aiding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the overall narrative, and because phone hacking amounts to one of the most egregious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examples of unethical press practices, a relatively brief recapitulation of the evidence is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provided here.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whilst the precise methods by which phone hacking was perpetrated do not require detailed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explanation, the evidence of Detective Inspector Mark Maberly is worth noting at this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">juncture.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref101" href="#footnote101">101</a></sup> One method of obtaining access to voicemails was referred to in Fleet Street</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">folklore as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> double</span><span style="font-style:italic"> whacking</span> &#8221;; this worked by one person ringing a mobile phone to engage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it, and then another person ringing the phone to be directed to the voicemail. With some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">telephone companies there was a prospect of then interrupting the voicemail message and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being diverted into the voicemail account where a PIN could be entered to listen to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">messages. As Mr Maberly observed, it would not be possible to use this method on too many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occasions as it would become difficult to justify repeated spurious calls and this would arouse</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suspicion. The method of voicemail interception used by Glenn Mulcaire, amongst others,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was a more sophisticated form of voicemail interception facilitated by calling into service</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">providers through a unique retrieval number and entering a PIN to listen to message, the PIN</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">often having previously been changed or reset to default by the intruder.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref102" href="#footnote102">102</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Interestingly, the evidence the Inquiry has received from Vodafone indicates that they were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apparently unaware of these possibilities until 2006.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref103" href="#footnote103">103</a></sup> Vodafone is a large company and its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">corporate memory may be difficult to pinpoint. Vodafone&#8217;s evidence needs to be considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the context of other material put before the Inquiry, including compelling evidence from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Steve Nott, which indicated that as early as 1999 the security flaw within the voicemail system</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was known about by at least two service providers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref104" href="#footnote104">104</a></sup></span>
<h4>News of the World</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Little needs to be said about the NoTW&#8217;s involvement in phone hacking, given the preceding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sections of this Report, but a short summary of the evidence canvassed previously is helpful.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Taking together the evidence which has emerged from the prosecution of Mr Mulcaire and Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Goodman, the admissions made by News International in the context of civil claims founded</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">upon allegations of phone hacking and what the Inquiry has been told by former employees,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in my view there is clear evidence that voicemail interception was occurring at NoTW from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if not slightly before 2000, and probably continued until around 2009.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref105" href="#footnote105">105</a></sup> It is equally clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that these practices were not limited to a single journalist. In opening the Inquiry, Robert</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Jay QC described these activities as amounting to a &#8216;thriving cottage industry&#8217;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref106" href="#footnote106">106</a></sup> Without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">delving into any of the detail regarding particular journalists or employees of the company,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which would plainly be inappropriate given the extant criminal proceedings, it would not be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unfair to describe the practice of voicemail interception within a part or parts of the NoTW</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as cultural.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has also heard evidence which suggests that phone hacking may not have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">confined to NoTW, and may have been occurring at other tabloid newspapers, including the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Daily Mirror. All of this evidence needs to be considered by the Inquiry with great precision,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as well as a measure of caution, partly because civil claims have been issued in respect of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allegations of phone hacking at the Daily Mirror,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref107" href="#footnote107">107</a></sup> but also because it is generally unfair to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Heather Mills, which may be summarised as follows. In 2001 a number of voicemail messages</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were left by Sir Paul McCartney on Ms Mills&#8217; mobile phone following a disagreement between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them. The precise content of the messages is immaterial, save to note that in the messages</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Paul apologised and sought forgiveness from Ms Mills through song. Ms Mills picked up</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the voicemail messages the following day, she recalls the messages were treated as &#8220;saved&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">messages, rather than as &#8220;new&#8221; messages on her voicemail system, which she thought was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unusual but did not regard as significant at the time. Later that day she was telephoned by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a former employee of Trinity Mirror Group (TMG) who told her they had heard that she had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argued with her then partner, who had sung down the phone. Ms Mills responded that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only way this could have been known was to listen to her voicemail, to which the journalist</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">laughed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref108" href="#footnote108">108</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In October 2006 it was reported in an article written by Piers Morgan in the Mail Online that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he had been played a tape of a voicemail message left for Ms Mills in 2001. The article read</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Morgan confirmed in his evidence to the Inquiry that he had listened to a tape of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail message left for Ms Mills in around 2000 or 2001 when he was editor of the Daily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mirror. MrMorgan was asked to explain his understanding of how the tape had been obtained.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">His evidence was that he had no reason to believe that this had been through an unlawful</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">means, and no story had been published by the Daily Mirror based on the tape.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref110" href="#footnote110">110</a></sup> Mr Morgan</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">declined to give any evidence to the Inquiry relating to the provenance of the voicemail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">message, the circumstances in which the tape was played to him, or any evidence to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effect that Ms Mills had consented to or authorised his actions, invoking the confidentiality</span>

<p id="para-id-3-13"><a href="#para3-13" name="para3-13">3.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Mills confirmed to the Inquiry that she had never played the message described by Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Morgan to anyone, never taken a recording of the messages and that the messages were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deleted in 2001.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref112" href="#footnote112">112</a></sup> Ms Mills has also confirmed that she never authorised Mr Morgan to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">When subsequently asked to comment on Ms Mills&#8217; evidence, Mr Morgan placed in issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her assertion that she had never played her voicemail messages to anyone, and put before</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry a witness statement from John Ferriter (Ms Mill&#8217;s agent at the time, and now Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Morgan&#8217;s agent) dated 29 October 2012 which claimed that, in 2007, Ms Mills played him</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a recording of a voicemail message left by Sir Paul.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref115" href="#footnote115">115</a></sup> It is clear from the context that this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular message was left very much later than the message to which Mr Morgan&#8217;s evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relates (although Mr Ferriter is not specific about this), and for that reason alone is irrelevant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the issue the Inquiry is considering. It has been noted that, when asked to comment on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extracts of Mr Ferriter&#8217;s evidence, Ms Mills denied ever having played Mr Ferriter a voicemail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">message.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref116" href="#footnote116">116</a></sup> Ms Mills reiterated her sworn testimony that the voicemail message Mr Morgan</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Inquiry, I accept the account that Ms Mills has provided.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-15"><a href="#para3-15" name="para3-15">3.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence relating to this particular episode cannot be considered in isolation. The Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also heard evidence from Jeremy Paxman and Richard Wallace in relation the possibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the voicemail of Ulrika Jonsson had been hacked by the Mirror. Mr Morgan, in his book</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Insider<span style="font-style:normal"> ,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> described</span><span style="font-style:normal"> an</span><span style="font-style:normal"> incident</span><span style="font-style:normal"> during</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> period</span><span style="font-style:normal"> when</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> editor</span><span style="font-style:normal"> where</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Wallace,</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then the showbusiness editor employed by the Daily Mirror, had come into his office with a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;wicked grin&#8221; on his face and relayed to him a story about the details of Ms Jonsson&#8217;s private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">life. Mr Wallace in his evidence explained that this tip off had come from the showbusiness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">team at the Daily Mirror; he accepted that he could not positively assert what the source of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the tip off was, and acknowledged that it was possible the source was phone hacking.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref117" href="#footnote117">117</a></sup> Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Morgan subsequently called Ms Jonsson&#8217;s agent who had confirmed that the details of the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">story were true.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-16"><a href="#para3-16" name="para3-16">3.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As for Mr Paxman, he explained that he attended a lunch at the offices of TMG on or around</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">20 September 2002; the lunch was hosted by Sir Victor Blank, the then Chairman of TMG,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the then editor of the Sunday Mirror, Mr Morgan. Ms Jonsson, Philip Green and a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of others were also present. In the course of conversation he heard Mr Morgan joke</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Ms Jonsson that he knew the content of conversations between Ms Jonsson and Sven</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Goran Eriksson, with whom Ms Jonsson had had a relationship. Mr Paxman explained that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Morgan turned to him and asked him whether he had a mobile phone and whether he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had a security setting on the message facility; he then explained that the way to gain access</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to peoples&#8217; messages was to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> go</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> factory</span><span style="font-style:italic"> default</span><span style="font-style:italic"> setting</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> press</span><span style="font-style:italic"> either</span><span style="font-style:italic"> 0000</span><span style="font-style:italic"> or</span><span style="font-style:italic"> 1234</span> &#8221;,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and further said that if you did not put on your own code, in Mr Morgan&#8217;s words, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> You&#8217;re</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">fool.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref118" href="#footnote118">118</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-17"><a href="#para3-17" name="para3-17">3.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This evidence does not establish that Mr Morgan authorised the hacking of voicemails or that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists employed by TMG were indulging in this practice. What it does, however, clearly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prove is that he was aware that it was taking place in the press as a whole and that he was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficiently unembarrassed by what was criminal behaviour that he was prepared to joke</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about it. Whatever other inferences might be drawn from Mr Paxman&#8217;s convincing evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on this issue, it is sufficient for present purposes to leave the matter there.</span>

 <p id="para-id-3-18"><a href="#para3-18" name="para3-18">3.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry also heard evidence from James Hipwell, who was employed as a journalist at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Daily Mirror from 1998 to 2000 and worked on the City desk. He sat next to the Daily Mirror&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">showbiz journalists and explained in his evidence that he was able to see at close hand how</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they operated. He observed journalists carrying out repeated privacy infringements, by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking into the voicemail systems of celebrities, their friends, publicists and public relations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">executives. Mr Hipwell observed that the openness and frequency of their hacking activities</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gave him the impression that hacking was considered a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> bog-standard</span><span style="font-style:italic"> journalistic</span><span style="font-style:italic"> tool</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">gathering information&#8221;.<span style="font-style:normal"> He</span><span style="font-style:normal"> explained</span><span style="font-style:normal"> how</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> heard</span><span style="font-style:normal"> showbiz</span><span style="font-style:normal"> journalists</span><span style="font-style:normal"> openly</span><span style="font-style:normal"> discussing</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what had been heard on voicemails and one of the journalists showed Mr Hipwell how to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hack into voicemails. He also observed that, on occasions, the journalists would joke about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">having deleted a message from a celebrity&#8217;s voicemail to ensure no journalist from The Sun</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would get the same scoop by hacking. Mr Hipwell further explained that he observed this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conduct on a daily basis in 1999 and a great number of the Daily Mirror&#8217;s showbusiness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories would come from phone hacking.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref119" href="#footnote119">119</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-19"><a href="#para3-19" name="para3-19">3.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although doubts may exist as to Mr Hipwell&#8217;s credibility, given his criminal record and the real</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">risk that he bears a grudge towards his former employer, the account he gave to the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on these matters was clear, firm and convincing.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref120" href="#footnote120">120</a></sup> Mr Hipwell did not name any individual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists, and his evidence cannot do more than serve to demonstrate that phone hacking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a practice may well have been occurring at the Mirror titles when Mr Hipwell was working</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there. Mr Morgan denied knowing about the activities described by Mr Hipwell,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref121" href="#footnote121">121</a></sup> and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">latter did not say in terms that the editor knew about them.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-20"><a href="#para3-20" name="para3-20">3.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The issue for consideration at this stage is exactly what inferences the Inquiry is minded</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to draw in relation to Mr Morgan. It is right that the Inquiry is explicit about this, given the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public concerns which followed the receipt by the Inquiry of Mr Morgan&#8217;s oral evidence in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">December 2011 and the prominence given to the reporting of Mr Paxman&#8217;s evidence. There</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is no evidence that Mr Morgan hacked into any mobile phone and, because of the approach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have adopted, it would be unfair and wrong in principle to reach any conclusion that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expressly authorised the hacking of voicemails at the Mirror titles or was aware that this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice had occurred in any individual case. Further, Mr Morgan has refused to reveal his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;confidential source&#8217; in Ms Mills&#8217; case and the Inquiry faces the perennial difficulty of not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being able to penetrate beneath that refusal.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-21"><a href="#para3-21" name="para3-21">3.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For the avoidance of doubt, however, the Inquiry does conclude that the practice of phone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking may well have taken place at the Mirror titles at the time Mr Hipwell was working</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there, that Ms Mills&#8217; voicemail probably was hacked into by someone (albeit it is unnecessary,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if not impossible, to reach a conclusion as to whether he or she was a Mirror journalist), and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it is equally probable that Ms Jonsson&#8217;s voicemail was hacked into.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-22"><a href="#para3-22" name="para3-22">3.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is a separate issue whether Mr Morgan was aware in broad terms of the general practice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of phone hacking. This issue, touched upon above in relation to the evidence of Mr Paxman,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will be addressed below under a separate rubric.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-23"><a href="#para3-23" name="para3-23">3.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It should be noted that the evidence heard by the Inquiry relating to phone hacking is not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">confined to NoTW and the Mirror titles. However, the evidence in relation to the use of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">technique at other titles was limited and problematic. Paul McMullan&#8217;s belief was that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice of phone hacking was not limited to the NoTW, but he was unable to provide any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">firm evidence for this belief. Stuart Hoare recalled that his brother Sean had told him that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice was widely used at The Sun<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref122" href="#footnote122">122</a></sup> but, given that this was hearsay evidence, and wholly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">untested, it is difficult to place any substantial weight on it.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-24"><a href="#para3-24" name="para3-24">3.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mark Lewis, a solicitor and partner at law firm Taylor Hampton, told the Inquiry that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">received a compact disc which had the recording of a conversation between Mr Mulcaire and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a person working for a newspaperowned by Associated Newspapers Ltd, in which Mr Mulcaire</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was teaching that person how to hack a mobile phone.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref123" href="#footnote123">123</a></sup> However, it is difficult to see how far</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this evidence goes because, on its own, it does not start to establish that phone hacking was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practised by anyone at any of these titles. Furthermore, although evidence from Mr Davies<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref124" href="#footnote124">124</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and from anonymous journalists whose evidence was related by Ms Stanistreet of the NUJ,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggested that phone hacking was being deployed through a range of mid-market, red top</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and broadsheet newspapers,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref125" href="#footnote125">125</a></sup> this evidence, taken in isolation, is insufficient to establish, on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any basis, that these practices occurred.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-25"><a href="#para3-25" name="para3-25">3.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Overall, the available evidence does not allow me to conclude to the requisite standard of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proof that the practice of phone hacking occurred at any specific individual title other than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the NoTW and, to the extent already discussed, the Mirror titles. There is, however, another</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way of examining this issue, which is to consider the evidence of a more general nature which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry has received to the effect that phone hacking was occurring on a widespread</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">basis within the industry, that many knew of it, and that no one did anything to address it.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The significance of this evidence is that it throws light on the culture, practices and ethics</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press at a truly generic level. It does not directly implicate any individual title, but it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">establishes the potentially broad nature of the practice across an indeterminate number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unnamed titles, as well as a cultural indifference within the industry to its prevalence. It is this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence which now falls to be analysed.</span>
<h4>Industry knowledge of phone hacking and response to phone hacking</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-26"><a href="#para3-26" name="para3-26">3.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry heard evidence from a number of journalists and editors which supports the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusion that there were at the very least rumours circulating in Fleet Street that phone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking was occurring on a systematic basis, and some evidence from travels considerably</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">beyond the limited realm of rumour.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-27"><a href="#para3-27" name="para3-27">3.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is convenient to commence this section by returning to the evidence of Mr Morgan. In the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">first volume of his published diaries,<span style="font-style:italic"> The</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Insider</span> , he records under the entry for 26 January</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2001 that he had been told that people might be listening to his mobile phone messages</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because, if the security code was not changed, then anyone could call his number and if he</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">when he testified to the Inquiry. He said that, as far as he was aware, he had not previously</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">known of this ruse,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref127" href="#footnote127">127</a></sup> but could not recall who had made him aware of it.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref128" href="#footnote128">128</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-28"><a href="#para3-28" name="para3-28">3.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Morgan was then asked about an interview which he gave to the Press Gazette in 2007,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in which he said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref129" href="#footnote129">129</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;As for Clive Goodman, I feel a lot of sympathy for a man who has been the convenient</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fall guy for an investigative practice that everyone knows was going on at almost</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">every paper in Fleet Street for years.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-29"><a href="#para3-29" name="para3-29">3.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When asked to clarify that evidence, Mr Morgan&#8217;s explanation was as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref130" href="#footnote130">130</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;Well, that was the rumour mill at the time. I mean, it was exploding around Fleet</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Street. I wasn&#8217;t there, I hadn&#8217;t been there for three years, but everyone you talked to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">said that he was being made a scapegoat, that this was a widely prevalent thing. I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wasn&#8217;t aware that it was widely prevalent in any specific form. I was hearing these</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rumours like everybody else. The reality is that it certainly seems to have been much</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more widespread at one newspaper, and we now know that the Guardian also phone-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hacked, so you had two newspapers. So it&#8217;s certainly wider apparently than just Clive</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Goodman, but I&#8217;m not going to get into rumour-mongering because that&#8217;s not really</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the point of this Inquiry, I don&#8217;t think.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. But were you rumour-mongering when you had the interview with the Press</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Gazette in 2007 or were you speaking from your own experience?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. No, I was just passing on rumours that I&#8217;d heard.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Was this a practice which, if we may add a third newspaper to the mix, was taking</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">place within the Daily Mirror before 2004?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I do not believe so, no.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">Q. You don&#8217;t believe so, or you&#8217;re sure?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">A. I don&#8217;t believe so. To the best of my recollection, I do not believe so.&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-30"><a href="#para3-30" name="para3-30">3.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This was not, in any sense at all, a convincing answer. Mr Morgan could not even resist a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further side-swipe at the Guardian (he had earlier referred to that title as the self-appointed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bishops of Fleet Street), perhaps in an attempt to draw attention away from the broader</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ramifications of the question. When linked with other evidence, his reference to &#8216;the rumour</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mill&#8217; somewhat downplayed the quality of the evidence incriminating the industry as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whole. And Mr Morgan chose his words very carefully when asked to speak about the Daily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mirror. Overall, Mr Morgan&#8217;s attempt to push back from his own bullish statement to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press Gazette was utterly unpersuasive.</span>

 <p id="para-id-3-31"><a href="#para3-31" name="para3-31">3.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Morgan was also asked about what he had appeared to admit in relation to phone hacking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">during the course of his appearance on Desert Island Discs in June 2009, but he explained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he had misheard Kirsty Young&#8217;s question.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref131" href="#footnote131">131</a></sup> But, in an article originally published in April</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2007 in GQ magazine it is clear that Mr Morgan had no difficulty hearing the questions which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Naomi Campbell started to put to him about phone hacking:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref132" href="#footnote132">132</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;Q. Ms Campbell asked you: &#8220;It is an invasion of privacy though.&#8221; And you say:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It is, yes, but loads of newspaper journalists were doing it. Clive Goodman, the News</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the World reporter, has been made the scapegoat for a very widespread practice.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So you&#8217;re making it clear there what your belief was in April 2007; is that correct?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yeah, and it seems to have been borne out by events.&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-32"><a href="#para3-32" name="para3-32">3.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Unsurprisingly, there was little or no material difference between what Mr Morgan told the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PressGazetteandMsCampbellin2007.OnthisoccasionMrMorgan&#8217;sexplanationwassimilar:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there were endless rumours that the practice went much further than Mr Goodman. For</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obvious reasons, Mr Morgan conceded that these &#8216;rumours&#8217; turned out to correct.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-33"><a href="#para3-33" name="para3-33">3.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Max Clifford explained in his evidence that it was common rumour in the media that mobile</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">telephones were being hacked from early 2000 and that this was a topic which various</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists and people working in the industry discussed in his presence.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref133" href="#footnote133">133</a></sup> In a similar vein, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2002, Dominic Mohan, then the showbusiness editor at The Sun, gave a speech to members</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press at the Princess Margaret Awards in which (no doubt with a trace of irony) he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thanked Vodafone&#8217;s &#8216;lack of security&#8217; for the Mirror&#8217;s showbusiness exclusives. Mr Mohan</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accepted in evidence that this was a reference to the rumour, if not the fact, that one could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hack into Vodafone&#8217;s mobile phones because their PIN system was so easily penetrable,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">particularly if the default setting had not been changed. He acknowledged that it was well</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">known it was possible to hack voicemails fairly readily and stated there had been a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of articles printed about this, including in the Daily Mirror which, in 1998, had published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a piece about the lax security around the Irish cabinet&#8217;s mobile phones, with part of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation being the hacking into voicemails.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref134" href="#footnote134">134</a></sup> That said, this Irish example was somewhat</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stale material in the public domain. It is likely that Mr Mohan&#8217;s sources were both more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recent and closer to home.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-34"><a href="#para3-34" name="para3-34">3.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When Mr Mohan first testified as to these matters, in particular his speech at the Princess</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Margaret awards, it is interesting quite how close his words of explanation were to Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Morgan&#8217;s:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref135" href="#footnote135">135</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Wasn&#8217;t the true position something along these lines: that there were rumours</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">going around in the press, which you well knew about, which were suggesting that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">phone hacking was occurring on a fairly systematic basis in the Mirror&#8217;s titles? Is that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">right or not?</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. There were rumours in the industry. There&#8217;s always rumours in the industry about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">various methods, but this wasn&#8217;t based upon any evidence at all. It was just the Fleet</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Street rumour mill.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. You weren&#8217;t concerned about the law of defamation, were you, when you made</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this statement?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I don&#8217;t remember that I was, no.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-35"><a href="#para3-35" name="para3-35">3.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He also explained that this speech was purely a joke, and a cheap shot at the Daily Mirror,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which had had a successful year.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref136" href="#footnote136">136</a></sup> Mr Mohan returned to give further evidence on a range of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matters towards the end of Module One. On that occasion he was asked to explain the source</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a series of articles in the<span style="font-style:italic"> Bizarre</span> column of The Sun, because others had suggested that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material evidence had been procured by phone hacking. Mr Mohan denied this suggestion,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and there is no evidence to contradict him.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref137" href="#footnote137">137</a></sup> It was put to him that his joke about Vodafone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had raised the biggest laugh of the evening, but he claimed that he could not remember one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way or the other.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref138" href="#footnote138">138</a></sup> He also denied that he had &#8216;borrowed&#8217; Mr Morgan&#8217;s terminology when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">previously testifying about phone hacking in order to draw attention away from the fact that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he knew that phone hacking had been taking place at the paper,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref139" href="#footnote139">139</a></sup> (or it might be added</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">elsewhere). In this context it is notable that Duncan Larcombe, the Royal Editor at The Sun,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commented that he would not be surprised that if there were or had been the technology to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intercept voicemail, it might have been being abused by some journalists on some papers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref140" href="#footnote140">140</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-36"><a href="#para3-36" name="para3-36">3.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of editors, former editors and in house lawyers acknowledged in their evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that phone hacking may have been occurring but suggested that they were not aware of the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice or that it was hidden from them. For example, Mr Wallace explained that when he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was showbiz editor at the Daily Mirror, he was not aware of phone hacking being conducted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by journalists on the showbiz team but acknowledged that the practice &#8216;might well&#8217; have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken place and been hidden from him.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref141" href="#footnote141">141</a></sup> He also acknowledged that the tip off in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to a story on Ms Jonsson, which came from the showbiz team, could have been a result of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">phone hacking.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref142" href="#footnote142">142</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-37"><a href="#para3-37" name="para3-37">3.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Drawing these various strands together, in my view the evidence which the Inquiry has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">received, viewed in the round, strongly suggests that phone hacking was a practice which,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">over the period from the late 1990s to the arrest of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire in 2006,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was occurring within the industry on a more than localised basis. The nature of the evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">currently available does not permit any more robust conclusion. Save for the evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relating to the Mirror titles which has already been examined, it is not possible, and indeed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is unnecessary, to seek to identify particular titles or to quantify the extent of the practice.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-38"><a href="#para3-38" name="para3-38">3.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Equally of interest to the Inquiry is the extent to which this practice was generally known</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about. The evidence of individual witnesses has been examined in some detail, and the point</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has already been made that the evidence of Mr Morgan, in particular, has already attracted</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">techniqueofphonehackingintheindustry,andthatarticleswerelikelytohavebeenpublished</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the basis of material obtained by that technique. Here, the Inquiry is referring to the issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at a level of some generality; it is unnecessary to be any more specific. Mr Morgan felt able</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to discuss the matter quite freely in his diary and when interviewed about it after the arrest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire. He also felt no compunction about alluding to the matter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in specific terms when lunching with Mr Paxman in September 2002. For him, the issue must</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been of current interest and worth talking about in that context. It is not plausible that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he was making an elaborate joke about things which simply had not occurred: Mr Paxman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">himself felt that Mr Morgan&#8217;s tone was bullying,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref143" href="#footnote143">143</a></sup> which, in any event, somewhat dispels the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">joke hypothesis.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-39"><a href="#para3-39" name="para3-39">3.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not possible to reach similar critical conclusions about Mr Mohan&#8217;s evidence, although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aspects of it gave cause for concern. It should be emphasised, however, that in arriving at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its overall conclusion relating to the state of the industry over the period which has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identified, I have not simply focused on the evidence of these two individuals: all relevant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence has been weighed and considered. My conclusion is that knowledge that phone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking was taking place existed in parts of the industry over the period from around 2000 to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2006, and that to speak only of rumours being rife underplays the extent of the understanding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and knowledge.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-40"><a href="#para3-40" name="para3-40">3.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is to my mind both striking and of serious concern that despite that knowledge and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rumours circulating through Fleet Street, nothing public was said or done about this issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">beyond a series of &#8216;in-jokes&#8217; at award ceremonies and unguarded references in memoires.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further, in the aftermath of convictions which definitively established that phone hacking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had occurred within at least one title, minimal steps were taken within the industry to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">identify whether phone hacking had occurred elsewhere or to investigate the extent of these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-41"><a href="#para3-41" name="para3-41">3.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For example, in 2007, after the convictions of Mr Mulcaire and Mr Goodman, TMG did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigate whether or not there had been phone hacking by any of their journalists. Sly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Bailey, the then Chief Executive of TMG, explained that there &#8220;was no evidence&#8221; and she</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not see a need to investigate.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref144" href="#footnote144">144</a></sup> The extent of her response to the convictions was to call</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a meeting of the editors of the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror and the People, the Group</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">managing editor and the then head of editorial to emphasise that she would not tolerate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unlawful activity.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref145" href="#footnote145">145</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-42"><a href="#para3-42" name="para3-42">3.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Even as recently as 2011, a Newsnight investigation alleged that phone hacking had occurred</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the Sunday Mirror, that celebrities&#8217; voicemails had been hacked and that reporters had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">listened to phone messages and taken a note of what was said. Although TMG denied the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allegations made by Newsnight, it appears that no formal complaint to the BBC was made<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref146" href="#footnote146">146</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Tina Weaver confirmed was that no investigation was carried out by the Sunday Mirror</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">as a result of it.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref147" href="#footnote147">147</a></sup> Lloyd Embley, who was appointed acting editor of the People in November</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2007, was asked questions of a general nature in relation to phone hacking, and his responses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resonated with those given by others:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref148" href="#footnote148">148</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. In terms of the hacking scandal, as that broke, what was done on your newspaper</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to deal with that as an industry issue?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. What was done on it?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">Q. Yes.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. In terms of ...?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Can you tell me whether anything was done?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. No. I do not believe any hacking has occurred on my newspaper. I&#8217;m certainly not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">aware of any. I&#8217;ve never asked anyone to hack a telephone. I&#8217;ve never seen anyone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hack a telephone. I&#8217;ve never heard anyone else ask anyone else to hack a telephone.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. That wasn&#8217;t quite my question. My question was really directed at whether your</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspaper did anything to prevent such occurrences.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. No, because I was reassured in myself that it wasn&#8217;t occurring.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-43"><a href="#para3-43" name="para3-43">3.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nicole Patterson, head of legal at Express Newspapers stated that no analysis of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper&#8217;s financial records had been undertaken to see whether Mr Mulcaire or any of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his associated companies had been engaged. The apparent justification of this position was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that she had not been told the paper had used any entities connected with Mr Mulcaire.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref149" href="#footnote149">149</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Without directly criticising Ms Patterson, her reasoning tends somewhat to circularity: in my</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view, some form of investigation could easily have identified whether journalists had used Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire to obtained information. This is not to suggest that phone hacking did take place at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any of the Northern & Shell titles; the point being made is that inadequate steps were taken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to establish that it had not.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-44"><a href="#para3-44" name="para3-44">3.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">After all, by 2007, rumours of phone hacking were well known in the industry. It was also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear, from the ICO&#8217;s publication of<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy?</span> and<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Now?</span> , that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">large parts of the press had engaged private investigators to trade confidential information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on an unprecedented scale. In that context, the convictions of Mr Mulcaire and Mr Goodman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should have prompted newspapers to conduct proper investigations of the working methods</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of their journalists. The refrain repeated by a number of titles to this Inquiry that there was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no need to launch an investigation because there was no evidence of a problem at their title</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">simply does not wash.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-45"><a href="#para3-45" name="para3-45">3.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The potential seriousness of rumours, allegations and suspicions of phone hacking are self-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evident. The Goodman and Mulcaire convictions should have sent out clear warning signals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the industry that phone hacking was a violation of the criminal law. Furthermore, at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the very least, it was a grossly unethical practice unless in the pursuit of a story that was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">demonstrably in the public interest and of such significance that justified risking the hazards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the criminal law. Despite this, the lethargy on the part of the industry to recognise the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gravity of this conduct, the reticence in conducting thorough investigations in relation to past</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">and present conduct of journalists and the lack of a rather clearer steer from editors than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been evidenced, is disappointing and tends to support the view that phone hacking was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">simply not taken seriously by the industry. It is not difficult to imagine what the reaction of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press would have been if a similar scandal had been exposed in another industry.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-46"><a href="#para3-46" name="para3-46">3.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">With the exception of the sterling investigative journalism conducted at the Guardian, most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other titles were slow to give prominence to the story, that is to say until the Milly Dowler</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story broke in July 2011. James Harding, editor of The Times, in addressing the point that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Times had been slow to pick up on the phone hacking story, acknowledged that this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was potentially due to external pressures, and sought to explain that both NI and the police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">poured cold water on the story at the time.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref150" href="#footnote150">150</a></sup> Other titles may have been concerned that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">giving publicity to the story might have the undesirable consequence of turning the lens of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scrutiny in their direction. But July 2011 represented a sea-change in approach; the story was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">now too big to leave alone. As Mr Harding put it, once the Milly Dowler revelations occurred,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> way</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> which</span><span style="font-style:italic"> we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> thought</span><span style="font-style:italic"> about</span><span style="font-style:italic"> what</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> happening</span><span style="font-style:italic"> or</span><span style="font-style:italic"> what</span><span style="font-style:italic"> had</span><span style="font-style:italic"> happened</span><span style="font-style:italic"> at</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> News</span></span>

<h4>The victims</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-47"><a href="#para3-47" name="para3-47">3.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Through all this, it is important not to lose sight of the victims of phone hacking. The reason</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">why it matters that large parts of the press failed to take allegations of phone hacking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seriously is not simply the fact that phone hacking is illegal; it is also because phone hacking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">amounted to an egregious breach of personal privacy and dignity which had seriously</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">detrimental consequences on many of its victims. That large parts of the press were so slow</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">in acknowledging this fact adds to the sense that there is, within those parts of the press, a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cultural indifference to individual privacy and dignity.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-48"><a href="#para3-48" name="para3-48">3.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The diversity of the targets of phone hacking is striking. Without engaging in a very detailed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">analysis, it is not possible to identify any particular class of person who was more likely to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be a victim than any other class. Although the targets included a large number of celebrities,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sports stars and people in positions of responsibility, they also included many other ordinary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals who happened to know a celebrity or sports star, or happened to be employed by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them. Other victims had no association with anyone in the public eye at all, but were, like the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dowlers, in the wrong place at the wrong time.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-49"><a href="#para3-49" name="para3-49">3.49</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The impact of phone hacking on its victims was clear: the experiences of the Dowlers, Ms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Miller and Ms Field were referred to elsewhere.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref152" href="#footnote152">152</a></sup> Similar evidence was also given by Ms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Church,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref153" href="#footnote153">153</a></sup> who explained she had been shown information that confirmed that her voicemail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been hacked when she was aged just 17. Ms Church&#8217;s evidence as to the impact of phone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking was striking: she said that she questioned how information was getting into the public</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Throughout the Inquiry, not a single witness suggested that any of the specific examples</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of phone hacking by the NoTW was justified in the public interest, and there is not a shred</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of evidence to suggest it was. Instead, it appeared to be a practice which, on the whole,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was directed at obtaining information about the private lives of those in the public eye &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">tittle tattle &#8211; cheaply. It may well have been cheap for the newspaper titles who utilised the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">technique, but it cost its victims dearly.</span>

<h3>Email hacking</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-52"><a href="#para3-52" name="para3-52">3.52</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has heard some evidence of computer and email hacking at both tabloid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and broadsheet publications, and undertaken by journalists directly as well as through</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intermediaries. As with phone hacking, computer and email hacking is a criminal offence<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref158" href="#footnote158">158</a></sup> to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which there is no public interest defence. For the avoidance of doubt, as with phone hacking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry has seen no evidence to suggest that a public interest defence, even if available,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could have been successfully raised in any individual case, save to the very limited extent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expressly referred to below. The scale of these activities is even more difficult to assess than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">phone hacking, in particular because the methods used to obtain the information require a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">greater degree of technological know-how and may well be harder to detect. I am conscious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the need not to speculate without sufficient evidence as to whether and, if so, to what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extent, computer and email hacking has taken place and whether this has been perpetrated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by journalists, or by third parties engaged by journalists for this purpose. However, it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important to record the evidence the Inquiry has heard on this issue as an example of conduct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which may, and I put it no higher than this, have been more widespread than these examples.</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">then employed a private detective specialising in applying and controlling computer viruses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to hack into his computer. He explained he was shown a fax which contained information from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his emails, and an extract from specific emails copied into the fax which had been sent to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW offices in Dublin during the time he was working in Northern Ireland in 2006. In this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">instance, the basis for the email hacking seems unlikely to be related to Mr Hurst&#8217;s private life,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but rather his role in recruiting and running agents in Republican terrorist groups. He further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained that hacking into emails was achieved through the use of a Trojan worm inserted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into the computer hard drive, in this case by way of an email being sent and opened.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref159" href="#footnote159">159</a></sup> This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allowed the hacker to see all emails sent and received by Mr Hurst for a three month period.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Jane Winter of British Irish Rights Watch was told in July 2011 that email communications and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">documents which had been sent by her to Mr Hurst had been illegally accessed, including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attachments to emails of a confidential and sensitive nature. The effect of the hacking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was described as &#8220;chilling&#8221; by Ms Winter because unauthorised access to material has the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potential to compromise official investigations and the safety of individuals.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref160" href="#footnote160">160</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-55"><a href="#para3-55" name="para3-55">3.55</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In Ms Miller&#8217;s amended claim against NGN she alleged that in September 2008, her email</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">account was hacked into using the same password as her mobile phone password, and that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private messages were accessed. On 12 May 2011, News International admitted all the causes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of action pleaded in her civil claim, including the allegation of email hacking.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref161" href="#footnote161">161</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-56"><a href="#para3-56" name="para3-56">3.56</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry also heard evidence in relation to the alleged hacking of an email account at The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Times, but for reasons which have already been explained it is inappropriate to explore this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue in detail. John Ryley, Head of Sky News, told the Inquiry that during his 12 years as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">senior executive, he was aware of two cases in which Sky News had authorised a journalist</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to access the email accounts of individuals suspected of criminal activity, on the grounds that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this decision was justified in the public interest. In one of these cases, the material that was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discovered by the Sky News journalists was of sufficient importance and relevance to criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigations that it was handed to the police and used to prosecute an individual.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref162" href="#footnote162">162</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Overall, it is safe to conclude that email hacking has taken place in recent years. However,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particularly in advance of the conclusion of the investigations by the officers on Operation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Tuleta, the evidence of email hacking is insufficiently robust to found any conclusions relevant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the culture, practices and ethics of the press. In those circumstances, the matter cannot be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken any further forward.</span>

 <h3>Blagging</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-58"><a href="#para3-58" name="para3-58">3.58</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence of a number of witnesses has addressed the use of blagging techniques to obtain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal information. The term blagging refers to obtaining information by impersonating</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">someoneentitledtotheinformation,eitherinperson,bytelephoneorthroughothermethods</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of communications. Usually, but not always, blagging will constitute an offence under s55 of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA). In instances where this provision applies, it should not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be overlooked that the statute contains a public interest defence. In instances where this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provision does not apply, and assuming that no other offence such as one under the Bribery</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Act 2010 or its predecessor legislation is in play, no issue of potential criminal liability could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arise, but ethical considerations obviously would.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-59"><a href="#para3-59" name="para3-59">3.59</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has heard that blagging and impersonation techniques were used by journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">directly and by intermediaries engaged by journalists for this purpose. A significant part of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the narrative relating to the use of blagging techniques is the evidence revealed by Operation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Motorman<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref163" href="#footnote163">163</a></sup> , which is addressed elsewhere in the Report.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref164" href="#footnote164">164</a></sup> However, it is worth recalling in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this context that the ICO investigation identified a widespread trade in personal information,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">driven in significant part by journalists, and uncovered conclusive evidence that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whittamore was regularly engaged personally, or through associates, in the use of blagging</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">techniques to acquire information which was then sold to journalists.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-60"><a href="#para3-60" name="para3-60">3.60</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In 2003 Richard Thomas, the then Information Commissioner, wrote to Sir Christopher</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Meyer, former Chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, identifying the problem in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">following terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref165" href="#footnote165">165</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It is clear from the very considerable volume of material that our investigations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have collected that journalists from most national newspapers and many periodicals</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are significant &#8217;customers&#8217; of the enquiry agents concerned. We have obtained</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">extensive and detailed records showing that numerous journalists routinely obtained</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">confidential information they should have no access to. Such information has, for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">example, been obtained to produce articles on the personal lives of &#8220;celebrities&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and others currently or prospectively in the public eye, where there appears to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">no suggestion of using it to expose wrong-doing We have also obtained extensive</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">records which show payments by newspapers for the confidential information which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">has been obtained through these channels. Given the sums involved, and the nature</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the documentation, it is difficult to believe that senior managers were not aware</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of what was going on, and were therefore at least tacitly condoning it. In short, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">material which has already been collected by my office indicates widespread reliance</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by the press on information which is obtained by deception or by bribing corrupt</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">employees.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-61"><a href="#para3-61" name="para3-61">3.61</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The documents retrieved as part of Operation Motorman reveal that in many instances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information would be obtained by Mr Whittamore, or through his associates, by blagging</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">techniques. As has already made clear, the Inquiry accepts the evidence of Mr Thomas that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any possible public interest justification is likely to have been non-existent save in a few</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">instances.</span>

 <p id="para-id-3-62"><a href="#para3-62" name="para3-62">3.62</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition to the evidence heard in relation to Operation Motorman, the Inquiry heard</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence that a number of journalists were themselves responsible for blagging or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attempting to blag information for stories.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref166" href="#footnote166">166</a></sup> The Inquiry also heard that in some instances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specific information would be blagged through the use of intermediaries, possibly in order</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to facilitate phone hacking which would be conducted by the journalist directly. For example,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Davies in his evidence explained that Mr Mulcaire would often not listen to voicemail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">messages himself, because this was mostly done by the journalists; but Mr Mulcaire would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enable this to take place because he, as a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> brilliant</span><span style="font-style:italic"> blagger</span> &#8221;, would get information and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">data from a mobile phone company and pass this to journalists.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref167" href="#footnote167">167</a></sup> Alex Owens (the ex-police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigator who worked with the Information Commissioner) took a similar view in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the activities of Mr Whittamore, namely that he was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> gathering</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> numbers</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8211;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> he</span><span style="font-style:italic"> wasn&#8217;t</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hacking, he was definitely not into hacking, we found no evidence of that. But he was then</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">passing them to the papers and possibly those numbers were being passed to people who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">hacked<span style="font-style:normal"> .&#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref168" href="#footnote168">168</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-63"><a href="#para3-63" name="para3-63">3.63</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As with phone hacking, the practice of blagging was not confined to a handful of &#8220;rogue&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reporters, nor was it confined to a particular section of the newspaper market. Journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from across the range of newspaper titles were engaged in using blagging techniques and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry heard evidence that these techniques were known, or at the very least rumoured,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be occurring widely within the industry. For example, Mr Davies in his book<span style="font-style:italic"> Flat</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Earth</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">News<span style="font-style:normal"> ,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> published</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> 2008,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> made</span><span style="font-style:normal"> reference</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> fact</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> by</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> mid-1990s,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Fleet</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Street</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was employing several dozen different agents to break the law on its behalf, mostly private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigators, and a few were ordinary civilians who developed the knack of blagging</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">confidential information out of banks and phone companies.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref169" href="#footnote169">169</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-64"><a href="#para3-64" name="para3-64">3.64</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Some examples of the practice of blagging provided by Ms Rowling and the anonymous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">witness HJK were addressed above.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref170" href="#footnote170">170</a></sup> Further examples were heard from other likely victims</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the practice. The Rt Hon Alex Salmond MSP explained that he believed his bank account</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was accessed by the Observer newspaper in 1999 after a former Observer journalist gave him</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a fairly exact account of the contents of his account, that could only be known to somebody</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who had seen it.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref171" href="#footnote171">171</a></sup> Alastair Campbell gave evidence to similar effect, namely that he had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">received calls from his bank and telephone companies indicating individuals had tried to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">access his accounts.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref172" href="#footnote172">172</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-65"><a href="#para3-65" name="para3-65">3.65</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Bob Crow, General Secretary of the National Union of Rail Maritime and Transport Workers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(RMT), explained how he believed someone had telephoned the DVLA stating (falsely) that a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">motorbike had broken down and providing the registration mark of the vehicle. That person</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">A further notable example of the practice was provided to the Inquiry by Matt Driscoll, a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalist formerly employed by NoTW. He explained that he was investigating a story into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">health problems of a prominent football manager, and his then sports editor had obtained the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">medical records of the individual concerned. Mr Driscoll said that he was told they had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obtained through blagging techniques, and that it was possible to obtain this information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">through an investigator sending a fax to a GP or a hospital saying &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> I&#8217;m</span><span style="font-style:italic"> his</span><span style="font-style:italic"> specialist,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> need</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Driscoll thought it unlikely the sports editor had carried out the blag himself, but noted that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there were &#8220;special people&#8221; on the news desk or features desk he went to.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref175" href="#footnote175">175</a></sup> His evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was further that specialist actors would be employed to obtain private information.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref176" href="#footnote176">176</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although it was clear that no possible public interest defence could have been run in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">example provided by Mr Driscoll, it is important to reflect on the extent to which the blagging</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">activities that have formed the evidence received by the Inquiry could generally be justified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as being in the public interest. It is appropriate to commence this analysis with a number of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">examples of blagging which would satisfy the public interest test.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-69"><a href="#para3-69" name="para3-69">3.69</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, Mr Davies recalled that a senior executive at the Guardian was responsible for procuring</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">House of Commons notepaper and writing to a hotel in Paris to obtain a copy of Jonathan</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Aitken MP&#8217;s hotel bill, this becoming a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> famous</span><span style="font-style:italic"> incident</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8211;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> referred</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> as</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> cod</span><span style="font-style:italic"> fax</span> &#8221;.

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Davies accepted that this conduct was blagging but, in this instance, there was clearly a public</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, journalist David Leigh, at the time a reporter with the Observer, told the Inquiry that,</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">into thinking he was Mr Amunyi. Mr Leigh defended his conduct on the basis that it was in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public interest as he was investigating impropriety of a public figure, and in this instance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the defence appears to be well-founded.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref178" href="#footnote178">178</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-71"><a href="#para3-71" name="para3-71">3.71</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Jon Witherow accepted that journalists at The Sunday Times had used blagging in the past,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and also impersonation techniques.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref179" href="#footnote179">179</a></sup> He gave some examples of cases where blagging and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impersonation techniques had been used in investigations undertaken by the newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including: in the 1980s, to establish financial links between the striking National Union of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mineworkers and Colonel Gadaffi; in the &#8216;cash for questions&#8217; articles which revealed that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MPs were prepared to take money for asking Parliamentary Questions, a reporter posed as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">businessman in order to deceive the MPs; and where a reporter posed as a potential donor to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigate the &#8216;cash for honours&#8217; scandal.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref180" href="#footnote180">180</a></sup> Further, as part of an investigation into whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Labour peers were prepared to propose amendments to legislation in return for cash,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reporters went undercover as lobbyists to try to obtain an amendment in return for cash. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all these cases, which have not been thoroughly investigated by the Inquiry, the potential for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a public interest justification seems clear. The Inquiry is therefore content to proceed on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">basis that the practices in these cases were justified as being in the public interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-72"><a href="#para3-72" name="para3-72">3.72</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of the Core Participants have submitted to the Inquiry that conclusions of a generic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nature should not be reached about the practice of blagging, for two principal reasons. First,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is pointed out that a public interest justification for the practice has been shown to exist in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a significant number of examples, and might exist in many others. Overall, it is argued that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry cannot assess the evidence, and the applicability of the potential defence, with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficient robustness to make any generic or cultural conclusions. Secondly, it is pointed out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the Operation Motorman evidence is now stale, and that the Inquiry should accept the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence of both the current and the former Information Commissioner that the press had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">got its house in order and no longer deployed practices of this sort.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-73"><a href="#para3-73" name="para3-73">3.73</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As for the first of these arguments, the Inquiry is entitled to adopt a commonsense approach.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In relation to the Operation Motorman material, a consideration of the material obtained by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Whittamore suggests that, in the vast majority of cases, it would have been extremely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">difficult to mount a public interest defence. This is also no more than Mr Thomas has pointed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out. In respect of what may be called genuine investigative journalism, and in cases where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was some evidence to justify a line of Inquiry which could not have been fruitfully</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pursued by other means, the use of blagging could have been justified; the Inquiry has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provided some instances where such a conclusion would appropriately be reached. In other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">instances, however, the activity could better be characterised as &#8216;fishing&#8217; rather than as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justifiable in the public interest. And then there is a whole body of cases, indeterminate in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">size and range but clearly more than isolated instances, well outside the envelope of genuine</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigative journalism, in which the practice of blagging is very likely to have been unlawful</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and almost certainly unethical. The scale of the practice cannot be quantified with precision,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but all the available evidence demonstrates that it occurred on a sufficiently prevalent basis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be &#8216;cultural&#8217;, and worthy of adverse comment.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thesecondargumentismoredifficulttoaddressforanumberofreasons.Inthespecificcontext</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Operation Motorman, I accept the evidence of the current Information Commissioner,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Christopher Graham, that his office has received no recent complaints of breaches of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DPA by journalists.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref181" href="#footnote181">181</a></sup> Although he would have expected to receive complaints had relevant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">victims known of unlawful activity concerning them, it is the nature of the offence under this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statute that it will typically be &#8216;silent&#8217;; after all, the evidence in Operation Motorman was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only revealed after the police were conducting a criminal investigation in which they involved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Information Commissioner (in the person of Mr Owens) who picked up a thread that led</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Mr Whittamore. Thus the absence of evidence does not prove a negative (namely that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the practice has ceased), but it is right to point out that there is no evidence which proves</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the type of conduct exemplified by the Operation Motorman material has continued in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recent years.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-75"><a href="#para3-75" name="para3-75">3.75</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Looking at blagging more widely, it is impossible to reach any firm conclusions. Blagging has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been a practice of some considerable pedigree and extent. It certainly formed part of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">culture, practices and ethics of the press for many years and was frequently not justified by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public interest. Is it plausible that such an ingrained practice has been totally eliminated,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">except where justified by the public interest? The short answer, notwithstanding the paucity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of recent evidence bearing on any particular title, is no.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-76"><a href="#para3-76" name="para3-76">3.76</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is most assuredly not to condemn legitimate investigative journalism in the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest in which blagging undoubtedly plays its part. This is supported by the evidence of Ian</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Hislop who stated &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> terms</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> blagging,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> don&#8217;t</span><span style="font-style:italic"> throw</span><span style="font-style:italic"> my</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hands</span><span style="font-style:italic"> up</span><span style="font-style:italic"> at</span><span style="font-style:italic"> blagging.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> There</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">are many instances that can be identified where blagging techniques had been used to obtain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information clearly in the public interest and thus both in accordance with the law and ethical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalism. But that is not a fair portrayal of the picture.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-77"><a href="#para3-77" name="para3-77">3.77</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Aside from the breadth and currency of the practice, little of which apparently can be seen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to have any legitimate public interest justification, it is appropriate to consider the manner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in which the press as a whole responded to the problem when its prevalence and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern about it was incontestable. By way of specific example, Mr Driscoll explained that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered the reaction to blagging in the newsroom was one of mirth.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref183" href="#footnote183">183</a></sup> Viewing the matter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at a somewhat higher level of generality, the industry response to the Operation Motorman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">revelations, and its approach to the use of private investigators and enquiry agents generally,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is itself revealing and is examined below in respect of various titles.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry heard evidence from the then editor of the Mail on Sunday, Peter Wright, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to the steps taken to investigate the use of Mr Whittamore&#8217;s services following</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his arrest in March 2003 and charge in February 2004. Mr Wright&#8217;s evidence was that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">managing editor had issued an instruction around February 2004 (although not as a direct</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">narrowly defined circumstances, namely with authorisation from departmental heads who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had to be satisfied that other means of obtaining information had been exhausted. Save for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">two payments made to Mr Whittamore in early 2005, Mr Wright told the Inquiry that the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigations were undertaken by the Mail on Sunday to identify which journalists were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">using Mr Whittamore&#8217;s services, whether or not they had been procuring the commission</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of offences, and whether there was a public interest defence for the activities and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information being obtained.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-80"><a href="#para3-80" name="para3-80">3.80</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Wright said in his evidence &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> why</span><span style="font-style:italic"> would</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> go</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> look</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span><span style="font-style:italic"> something</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hadn&#8217;t</span><span style="font-style:italic"> been</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">suggested to me? I mean, I could begin from the assumption that every single enquiry that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we make involves illegal activity of some sort, but I can&#8217;t do that<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref185" href="#footnote185">185</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Whilst</span><span style="font-style:normal"> it</span><span style="font-style:normal"> may</span><span style="font-style:normal"> have</span><span style="font-style:normal"> been</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">going too far to assume every enquiry made of Mr Whittamore was unlawful, there was a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">serious risk that in relation to some types of information, for example seeking friends and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">family numbers, or criminal record checks, breaches of s55 of the DPA had occurred. Certainly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the time the second report of the Information Commissioner was published in December</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2006, it was clear that the types of inquiries being made, for example criminal record checks,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were probably unlawful. Mr Wright went on:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref186" href="#footnote186">186</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I was aware by the time &#8220;What price privacy?&#8221; came out that the appropriate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">authorities, i.e. the Information Commissioner and the police, had conducted an</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation into this, that in I think two or three cases they had found evidence that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they thought warranted a prosecution, which resulted in a conditional discharge. I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">didn&#8217;t see the need to go over ground that they had gone over themselves, bearing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in mind also that we didn&#8217;t have and weren&#8217;t shown the evidence, Whittamore&#8217;s log</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">books, on which the Information Commissioner based his research.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-81"><a href="#para3-81" name="para3-81">3.81</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Without criticising Mr Wright, whereas the Information Commissioner and the police had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigatedMrWhittamoreandanumberofhisassociates,thoseentitieshadnotinvestigated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the activities of any journalists. Had there been any such investigation, the employers of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists involved would have been made aware. It follows that an investigation by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mail on Sunday into the activities of its journalists would not have been going over &#8220;old</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ground&#8221; but would have the potential to uncover new ground. The Mail on Sunday accepted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the overall findings of the Information Commissioner which included that 33 Mail on Sunday</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists had used Mr Whittamore for 266 transactions. In April 2007 the Mail on Sunday</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">banned the use of all external search agencies.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref187" href="#footnote187">187</a></sup></span>

 <h4>Daily Mail</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-82"><a href="#para3-82" name="para3-82">3.82</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Paul Dacre explained in evidence that, whilst he was aware of the use of Mr Whittamore</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from around 2004/2005, he was not aware of the extent to which his services were being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">used by journalists at the Daily Mail. Mr Dacre was asked to explain why he did not initiate an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation at this time into the extent to which Mr Whittamore&#8217;s services were being used</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the Daily Mail&#8217;s journalists. He replied:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref188" href="#footnote188">188</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;A. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s fair because everybody &#8211; everybody, every newspaper &#8211; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I see the BBC spent nearly as much on enquiry agents as we did &#8211; was using him.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We didn&#8217;t realise they were illegal. There was a very hazy understanding of how the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Data Protection Act worked and this was seen as a very quick way of obtaining phone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">numbers and addresses to corroborate stories.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Regardless of what other bodies might have been doing with search agencies,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we&#8217;re talking about what the Daily Mail was doing with Mr Whittamore, who, after</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">all, had had his collar &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Well, I mean &#8211; no, but I mean all newspapers were using &#8211; virtually all newspapers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were using Whittamore.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Are you saying that that would be a reason for the Daily Mail not carrying out a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proper investigation into the extent of the possible illegality, Mr Dacre?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Well, it&#8217;s very difficult to say that. The story of Operation Motorman barely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">registered on the consciousness. I don&#8217;t think it made much in the papers. One was</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">aware of it, I suspect, that the man had been given a conditional discharge. All</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapers were still using this agency. I repeat: we thought it was &#8211; we believed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the journalists believed that it was to get phone numbers quickly. I&#8217;m not sure an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation at that stage was warranted.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Regardless of how quick and efficient this might have been as a means of obtaining</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information, the concern, of course, is that this mode of information-gathering was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">illegal. Didn&#8217;t that cause you greater concern, Mr Dacre?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. We didn&#8217;t believe it was illegal. Our journalists were asking for information and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I&#8217;m not sure that the implications of the Data Protection Act were understood at that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">stage.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-83"><a href="#para3-83" name="para3-83">3.83</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This was revealing evidence on account of the light it throws on the culture, practices and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethics of the press. The argument that most other national newspapers were also using Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whittamore&#8217;s services does not tend to demonstrate the legality of the practice. At best, this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is a neutral factor which ought not to have engendered any degree of complacency. The fact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that no other newspaper carried out an investigation into what their journalists knew as to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Whittamore&#8217;s methods, despite their obvious wherewithal to do so, is a solid pointer to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ambient culture.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-84"><a href="#para3-84" name="para3-84">3.84</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although Mr Dacre does not merit being singled out in this regard, his belief that his journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were acting lawfully is something of a concern and certainly ought to have been put into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question by the Operation Motorman disclosures. Notwithstanding that data protection was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">somewhat of a Cinderella subject ten years ago, it is somewhat surprising that extensive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper operations, which clearly were involved in handling data all the time, had not</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref188" name="footnote188" title="Go back to footnote reference 188 in the text">188</a>.  pp49-50, lines 11-20, Paul Dacre, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-6-February-20121.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
 <span style="font-size: 15px;">ensured that they were sufficiently briefed on the implications of the data protection regime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when the Act was passed; and this is to say nothing of what newspaper titles ought to have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">done to investigate the implications of the Motorman disclosures.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-85"><a href="#para3-85" name="para3-85">3.85</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second report published by the Information Commissioner placed the Daily Mail at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">top of league table, with some 958 transactions which were claimed to have been identified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">positively as illegal, involving 58 journalists. In the aftermath of this report, Mr Dacre took</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a numbers of steps to respond to these revelations, including: writing provisions requiring</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compliance with the DPA into the contracts of journalists employed by the Daily Mail; holding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seminars to give training to journalists on this issue; and contacting all third parties that had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been used for research and information, including genealogists, tracing and search agencies,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">credit reference and information agencies and Inquiry agents by the Daily Mail, and asking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">each for an assurance in writing that their operations complied with the DPA.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref189" href="#footnote189">189</a></sup> Further, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">April 2007 Mr Dacre banned the use of search agents by the Daily Mail. Since that time, four</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">named organisations have been approved for use by the newspaper, namely a genealogical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">research agency, a credit information company for business information and two tracing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">agencies.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref190" href="#footnote190">190</a></sup> The Daily Mail&#8217;s actions between December 2006 and April 2007 were entirely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate and responsible.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-86"><a href="#para3-86" name="para3-86">3.86</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Dacre summarised his evidence in the following way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref191" href="#footnote191">191</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;All I am try to tell you is that when I did know the extent of it, I moved decisively and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ruthlessly to stamp it out. Other newspapers didn&#8217;t and we did&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">and</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In 2007 the Daily Mail brought the shutters down and banned absolutely the use of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Whittamore enquiry agencies&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-87"><a href="#para3-87" name="para3-87">3.87</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Dacre&#8217;s reference to what other newspapers were not doing will be addressed in due</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">course. In relation to the Mail titles, the issue of whether the shutters have indeed been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wholly brought down has been disputed on behalf of the Core Participant Victims.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-88"><a href="#para3-88" name="para3-88">3.88</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, it is said that the Whittamore data may still be located in the offices of Associated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Newspapers Ltd, because it is common ground that no positive steps have been taken to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">locate and erase it. That said, given the evidence that such data was not filed electronically but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">jotted down in journalists&#8217; notebooks, this appears unlikely and, in any event, is very difficult</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to investigate. Second, it is pointed out that some of the journalists using Mr Whittamore&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">services a decade ago are still working for the company in more senior positions. Even so,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in fairness to Associated Newspapers Ltd, I accept that it would have been impossible to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigate or discipline employees so many years after the events in question. A fairer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criticism of these titles relates to the lack of any investigation at an earlier stage.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Peter Hill, editor of the Daily Express from December 2003 to February 2011, said in evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Inquiry that he was not aware of the Information Commissioner&#8217;s reports, could not</span>

This does not precisely tally with the Information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner&#8217;s report which identified that a handful of journalists from the Daily Express</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had sought information from Mr Whittamore on around 20 occasions. Mr Hill accepted that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the more accurate position was that he had no idea whether private investigators were ever</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">used by the Daily Express and there was no evidence to suggest that an investigation had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken place.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref192" href="#footnote192">192</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-90"><a href="#para3-90" name="para3-90">3.90</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The lack of knowledge of the extent to which private investigators and search agencies had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been used at the Daily Express resonated with evidence relating to the Daily Star. Dawn</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Neesom, current editor of the Daily Star, acknowledged that she had not been aware that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">search agencies had been used until this had been brought to her attention by her legal team,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and acknowledged that it had surprised her that these methods had been deployed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref193" href="#footnote193">193</a></sup> She</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained that, at the Daily Star, the lineage sheets showing payments made were signed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">off by the deputy editor and these did not come to her attention. It was also apparent from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Neesom&#8217;s evidence that the corporate governance system at the Daily Star essentially</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consisted of what she described as a financial system and a staff handbook; there were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no processes or procedures in place to ensure transparency of conduct and accountability</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for methods used to obtain information, with the sums paid for this purpose. In answer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to a question directed to the adequacy of corporate governance at the paper, Ms Neesom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conceded:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref194" href="#footnote194">194</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">&#8216;Ithinktheremightbesometruthinthat.Oursystemwouldthrowupthingsfinancially,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think, as Nicole discussed earlier on, and on the lineage sheets those things would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">come up. On the Daily Star, the lineage sheets are always signed by my deputy editor,</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I don&#8217;t sign them, and as I said, the figures seemed to be &#163;50, &#163;70 here and there, so</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it&#8217;s not something that would come to my notice in that way.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-91"><a href="#para3-91" name="para3-91">3.91</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Neesom explained that the current system was under review, in particular a proposal to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">introduce some training for new journalists joining the team.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-92"><a href="#para3-92" name="para3-92">3.92</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Patterson, explained in her evidence that an internal investigation had been commenced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in July 2011 in relation to phone hacking, blagging and associated activities from 2000.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref195" href="#footnote195">195</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Patterson said that she had asked news editors and other editors and deputy editors for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">names of search agents or private investigators that had been used and these names were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">searched in the accounts.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">that whilst the invoices may contain the heading of the article it was not always apparent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what information had been the subject of the request. She explained that it was almost</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impossible to match up the activities of Mr Whittamore&#8217;s company with the financial records</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and any particular journalists. She said that where fixed fees appeared regularly, for example</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#163;75, these appeared to relate to searches for the same type of information. However, where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fees were higher, sometimes more than &#163;1,000, she understood that this was a different type</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of search, or subject to negotiation.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Patterson was not aware if JJ Services (one of Mr Whittamore&#8217;s companies) was still being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">used by Northern & Shell at present, although an examination of the records demonstrated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it was being engaged as recently as 2010.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref196" href="#footnote196">196</a></sup> When asked to explain why Northern & Shell</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had still been using the services of Mr Whittamore in recent years, Ms Patterson said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref197" href="#footnote197">197</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;It&#8217;s a matter for the news editor and the editor. It&#8217;s not something that is within my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">remit, I&#8217;m afraid, and I can&#8217;t speak for them.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. No, you can&#8217;t. Have you drawn these matters to the attention of the news editor</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the editor?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A. Yes.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. And what advice &#8211; you don&#8217;t have to tell us the advice.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A. No.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I can&#8217;t tell you that.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. No, because I don&#8217;t know&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This was another revealing answer. It speaks for itself.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-95"><a href="#para3-95" name="para3-95">3.95</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Patterson was not able to assist with the nature of the information that was being obtained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bythesearchagencies,andalsohighlightedthatitwasinthecircumstancesdifficulttoidentify</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what sums had been paid for precisely what services: for example, a sum was sometimes</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">quoted as a &#8220;day rate&#8221;, and it remained unclear to what this rate related.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref198" href="#footnote198">198</a></sup> In my view, these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigations could have been pursued with more success if the five search agencies that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been used had been contacted with a request to provide a detailed explanation of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">work completed for Northern & Shell, the methods deployed in each case and sources used</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to attain information. However Ms Patterson explained this had not been done.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-96"><a href="#para3-96" name="para3-96">3.96</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Paul Ashford, group editorial director of the Northern & Shell companies, explained that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not aware of the Information Commissioner&#8217;s reports until around 2010.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref199" href="#footnote199">199</a></sup> He explained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he had some concern as to whether any inappropriate action had taken place, but he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was informed by the legal department that agencies had been used as a means of finding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out contact information, so it was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> fairly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> low</span><span style="font-style:italic"> profile</span><span style="font-style:italic"> stuff</span> &#8221; and he was not overly concerned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about this. The fact that the Daily Express was still using Mr Whittamore as late as 2010 was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not brought to his attention.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-97"><a href="#para3-97" name="para3-97">3.97</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In terms of payments, Mr Ashford explained that the invoices primarily showed amounts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of &#163;75 or &#163;90, but in some cases there were invoices for &#163;1,000. Surprisingly, there was no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mechanism for determining precisely what the &#163;1,000 was purchasing: for example, whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this was the total of the searches conducted on one day, or on a number of days, or simply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one request. Mr Ashford accepted that the systems were, rightly, being reviewed and it would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be a good idea to have a system where it was possible to see with enough detail what has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been purchased.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-98"><a href="#para3-98" name="para3-98">3.98</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Witherow, confirmed that one journalist at The Sunday Times had made use of Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whittamore for four tasks. Certain investigations had been undertaken which revealed that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one such task was to trace the phone number of a former Home Office official who could not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be contacted through the Home Office. However, these investigations had not been easy as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the individual had left the newspaper.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref200" href="#footnote200">200</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-99"><a href="#para3-99" name="para3-99">3.99</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Two points ought to be made about this. First, the extent of the problem at The Sunday Times</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been minor, given that it only related to four cases. Second, this newspaper did more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than others to carry out an investigation.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-100"><a href="#para3-100" name="para3-100">3.100</a></p>
 Thomas Mockridge,</span> chief executive officer of<span style="font-weight:normal;"> NI, explained that the newspapers under his
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wing did not now employ private investigators (whom he defined as individuals who sought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to obtain information not otherwise in the public domain), save in circumstances where a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">request was made by an editor to Mr Mockridge and consent was given. He explained he had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not given approval for the use of private investigators to date. In relation to search agents</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(whom he defined as agencies obtaining information from publicly available records), these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were subject to the general governance of the company and were restricted in the ways they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operated, being held to the same standards as employees. Mr Mockridge accepted that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">methods being used by search agencies may require positive control by the newspaper and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ongoing attention to ensure the methods used were satisfactory.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref201" href="#footnote201">201</a></sup></span>
<h4>Trinity Mirror</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-101"><a href="#para3-101" name="para3-101">3.101</a></p>
 Mr Embley,</span> who was appointed acting editor of the People in November<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2007,</span> some<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 12
<span style="font-size: 15px;">months after the publication of the Information Commissioner&#8217;s second report, said in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence that he was unaware whether any investigations had been carried out as to whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or not transactions by People journalists with Mr Whittamore were legal or illegal. Mr Embley</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accepted that historically there had been a failure on the part of the media generally to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">respond to warnings; however, in relation to the People specifically, his evidence was to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effect that nothing had been done to react to warnings because he felt that no action was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">required.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref202" href="#footnote202">202</a></sup></span>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-102"><a href="#para3-102" name="para3-102">3.102</a></p>
 In reflecting upon what steps have been taken between the publication of the Information
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner&#8217;s Reports in 2006 and the present, both to investigate the use of private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigators and cash payments and improve governance structures to prevent the continued</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">use of unethical practices, it is clear that different newspaper groups have adopted varying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responses. That said, it is possible to draw at least two conclusions from the evidence heard</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the Inquiry.</span>

 <p id="para-id-3-103"><a href="#para3-103" name="para3-103">3.103</a></p>
 First,a number of newspapers were very slow off the mark to respond to the fact that
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Whittamore was arrested in 2003, and charged in 2004, for offences relating to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unlawful acquisition of private information. The majority of newspapers continued to use Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whittamore and his companies after his arrest, and in those circumstances there must have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been at least some risk that journalists engaging him might have been receiving information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which had been unethically, if not unlawfully, obtained. The Inquiry has received no evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that newspapers sought express written assurances from Mr Whittamore explaining his new</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">modus operandi<span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> confirming</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> his</span><span style="font-style:normal"> operation</span><span style="font-style:normal"> would</span><span style="font-style:normal"> now</span><span style="font-style:normal"> be</span><span style="font-style:normal"> both</span><span style="font-style:normal"> ethically</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> lawfully</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">carried out.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-104"><a href="#para3-104" name="para3-104">3.104</a></p>
 The arrest of Mr Whittamore in 2003</span> and subsequent<span style="font-weight:normal;"> charge, compounded by the knowledge
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(in some cases) that his services were being used, merited an investigation by newspapers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as to the circumstances in which his services had been commissioned, the nature of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information obtained, the extent to which he continued to be used and the nature of his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">current methods. Notwithstanding that such investigations should have been conducted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">earlier, the Information Commissioner&#8217;s second report was another reminder which should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have set in train detailed investigations into these issues.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-105"><a href="#para3-105" name="para3-105">3.105</a></p>
 Second,</span> it is clear<span style="font-weight:normal;"> that, in relation to those newspaper groups that did undertake belated
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigations into the use of private investigators, difficulties were encountered in trying to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">marry up invoices with the precise information that had been supplied to the journalists, or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the methods used. These difficulties point to deficiencies in financial systems and corporate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">governance which require to be addressed.</span>

<h3>Surveillance</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-106"><a href="#para3-106" name="para3-106">3.106</a></p>
 For many celebrities and people in the public eye, being photographed ona daily basis is
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commonplace. Whilst some of this publicity may be encouraged for the purpose of promoting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">causes or creating positive publicity, other elements of photography is not welcomed. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry has heard evidence from a number of witnesses in relation to photographers being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a constant presence outside their homes. By way of example Mr Coogan said that over a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">period of ten years photographers had frequently camped outside his house day and night.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref203" href="#footnote203">203</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has also heard of individuals being pursued by the paparazzi. Ms Miller in her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref204" href="#footnote204">204</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I would often find myself &#8211; I was 21 &#8211; at midnight running down a dark street on my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">own with ten big men chasing me and the fact that they had cameras in their hands</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">meant that that was legal, but if you take away the cameras, what have you got?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">You&#8217;ve got a pack of men chasing a woman and obviously that&#8217;s a very intimidating</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">situation to be in.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-107"><a href="#para3-107" name="para3-107">3.107</a></p>
 For the majority of these individuals the presence of photographers is known and obvious,
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indeed in some cases oppressively so. However, the Inquiry has also heard evidence that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">covert surveillance of individuals took place by the press, either directly by journalists or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indirectly through the use of intermediaries, in particular private investigators. The Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">heard evidence from a variety of people to the effect they had been placed under surveillance</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref203" name="footnote203" title="Go back to footnote reference 203 in the text">203</a>.

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">by newspapers; these individuals included celebrities and their friends and family,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref205" href="#footnote205">205</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref206" href="#footnote206">206</a></sup> but also individuals who were not obviously public figures.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-108"><a href="#para3-108" name="para3-108">3.108</a></p>
 The evidence relating to the NoTW&#8217;s employment of Derek Webb asa private investigator
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been discussed in detail elsewhere.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref207" href="#footnote207">207</a></sup> In the period spanning eight years, Mr Webb, a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">former police officer, placed approximately 150 people under surveillance on instruction</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from NoTW, including a number of celebrities, MPs, sportsmen and members of the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who were connected with famous individuals but were themselves of no particular interest.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He estimated roughly 85% of his time was spent investigating celebrities and MPs, and most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the instructions related to stories on the topic of sexual relationships, affairs and intimate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationships. In some instances, celebrities would be subject to surveillance over a period</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of up to two weeks by following them by car or on foot, or &#8221;<span style="font-style:italic"> solely</span><span style="font-style:italic"> watching</span><span style="font-style:italic"> them</span><span style="font-style:italic"> day</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> day</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence corresponded with that of Neville Thurlbeck in these respects.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref208" href="#footnote208">208</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-109"><a href="#para3-109" name="para3-109">3.109</a></p>
 Other examples of surveillance include that described by Mr Shear,a lawyer who was
<span style="font-size: 15px;">followed by journalists and photographers when attending to a client at a secret meeting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">place.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref209" href="#footnote209">209</a></sup> Similar evidence was given by Jacqueline Hames who together, with her husband</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">David Cook, was a serving police officer placed under surveillance by NI. This surveillance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">took the form of persons working in two vans, and on one occasion a van followed Mr Cook</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with his son and daughter to school. The NoTW&#8217;s alleged justification for this surveillance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was that it was suspected they were having an affair together, a position that lacked any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">credibility given that Ms Hames and Mr Cook had been married for some years and had two</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">children. Ms Hames has suggested other motives for the surveillance,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref210" href="#footnote210">210</a></sup> but the Inquiry was</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">unable, in the time available, to come to any firm conclusion on those alternative motives.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In any case, the impact on Ms Hames was significant: it provoked considerable anxiety, had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significant consequences for her private life and her distress was evident in the course of her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence to the Inquiry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref211" href="#footnote211">211</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-110"><a href="#para3-110" name="para3-110">3.110</a></p>
 The damage that can be occasioned by covert surveillance, particularly where surveillance
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cuts across police investigations, was also highlighted to the Inquiry. David Harrison was an</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">murder of five young women in Ipswich. SOCA was assisting Suffolk police with surveillance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potential suspects. Mr Harrison was informed that NoTW had deployed a surveillance team to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identify the SOCA officers and, on at least two occasions during the course of his surveillance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">work, observed vehicles undertaking surveillance of the SOCA team. Mr Harrison conveyed his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns that the activities of NoTW could have jeopardised the police investigation because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the efforts of the SOCA team in trying to avoid being subject to surveillance themselves by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the newspaper distracted them from trailing a suspect and further weakened their ability to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">look for evidence.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref212" href="#footnote212">212</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-111"><a href="#para3-111" name="para3-111">3.111</a></p>
 Mr Harrison made other claims abouta surveillance team from the Sunday Mirror who were
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seeking to pick up the suspect and take him to a place where he could be debriefed. However,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the evidence in relation to such a team was unclear, and the Inquiry is satisfied on the basis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of submissions made by counsel for Trinity Mirror that it did not exist.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref213" href="#footnote213">213</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-112"><a href="#para3-112" name="para3-112">3.112</a></p>
 Inevitably in relation to an issue of this sort,</span> the Inquiry may have receiveda somewhat<span style="font-weight:normal;"> one-
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sided impression. It is quite possible that surveillance has on occasion been justified in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest, both in terms of the decision to deploy the technique and the resultant story.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That said, the Inquiry received little evidence from newspapers containing concrete examples</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of what might be described as &#8216;good practice&#8217; in this regard. What is more likely is that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">use of surveillance in individual cases has often led to newspapers deciding not to print</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories, either because such surveillance specifically contradicted the story that was being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">planned, or because it failed to prove the matter one way or the other. The evidence from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographer Matt Sprake was very much along these lines. One might think that the ethical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues which arise are likely to be more nuanced in these circumstances: the absence of a story</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">means, by definition, that nothing has been placed in the public domain, but questions still</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">fall to be asked about the basis for the decision to use an intrusive technique in circumstances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where the ultimate goal may, in many cases, only be a story devoid of a public interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-113"><a href="#para3-113" name="para3-113">3.113</a></p>
 Mr Sprake&#8217;s</span> evidence was alarming in two respects. First, he provideda<span style="font-weight:normal;"> &#8216;worklog&#8217;, evidencing
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the fact that he had been commissioned by a number of titles (but predominantly by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">People) to carry out covert surveillance and/or photography on over 300 different subjects</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between July 2010 and June 2012.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref214" href="#footnote214">214</a></sup> Consistent with Mr Webb&#8217;s worklog, the majority of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the jobs appeared to relate to celebrity gossip and therefore the subterfuge was unlikely to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been justified in the public interest. Second, his oral evidence was of particular concern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">insomuch as he appeared not to recognise that he had ethical judgments to make in carrying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out his tasks. When asked about the ethics of one particular example of covert photography,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he said:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> think</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> an</span><span style="font-style:italic"> answer</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> newspaper,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> really,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> rather</span><span style="font-style:italic"> than</span><span style="font-style:italic"> us.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> We&#8217;re</span><span style="font-style:italic"> tasked</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span></span>

 In relation to the evidence which the Inquiry has specifically considered, it does appear
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, in respect of the vast majority of the instances in which surveillance has been used,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inadequate consideration has been given to whether such surveillance is itself justified in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public interest, let alone whether it is likely to produce any relevant information which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">goes to a story which is being contemplated. Some of the surveillance appears to have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commenced on a purely speculative basis in the hope that some fragments of interesting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material might be obtained if a person is trailed for long enough, and in the many examples</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry saw of surveillance commissioned with a particular purpose in mind, there was in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any event no public interest justification for the surveillance in the first place.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-115"><a href="#para3-115" name="para3-115">3.115</a></p>
 Another method at one stage used by the press to obtain private information was
<span style="font-size: 15px;">misappropriation and theft of property.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-116"><a href="#para3-116" name="para3-116">3.116</a></p>
 One practice which appears to have been used frequently was the searching of refuse outside
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the homes of persons of interests to newspapers, or &#8220;binnology&#8221; as it has become known. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular, the Inquiry heard that newspapers engaged the services of Benjamin Pell (known</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as Benjy the Binman) to search for documents and other information in rubbish bins outside</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the homes and offices of celebrities, and the offices of their accountants and lawyers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref216" href="#footnote216">216</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">actually, than hacking a phone because that almost tips them off that you&#8217;re looking...&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref217" href="#footnote217">217</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In an article written in 2006 &#8220;Scandal on Tap&#8221;, Mr Leigh explained that he &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> did</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> turn</span><span style="font-style:italic"> up</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">[his] nose when the notorious Benjy the binman emptied a bag of stinking rubbish onto [his]</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">carpet. He wanted to show<span style="font-style:normal"> [him]</span> incriminating statements about Saudi arms deals which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a City law firm had been too idle to shred before putting out on the street for collection.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref218" href="#footnote218">218</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, Mr Leigh also made it clear that he also had a look at other rubbish which might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also have contained material relevant to a public interest story.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-118"><a href="#para3-118" name="para3-118">3.118</a></p>
 Mr Morgan explained that he had engaged the services of Benjy the Binman on several
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occasions, including one where he was presented with sacks which were full of documents</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relating to Elton John; this included bank statements and had been obtained from the bins of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr John&#8217;s manager. Mr Morgan considered that this conduct was not illegal and was on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cusp of being unethical.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref219" href="#footnote219">219</a></sup></span>

 The rummaging through bins was practised both in relation to celebrities but also offices of
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers and magazines. Mr Hislop, for example, explained that the bins outside Private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Eye had been searched and that, in due course, an article which probably derived from that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rubbish appeared in one magazine.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref220" href="#footnote220">220</a></sup> Mr Campbell told the Inquiry that he would wake</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">up in the night with people going through his bins and Mr Coogan had experienced similar</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">instances with people going through his bins early in the morning.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref221" href="#footnote221">221</a></sup> The searching of bins</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has also proven to be a mobile operation, and one that is not defunct. In June 2011, an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual journalist who stated that he was working as a freelancer for The Sunday Times</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was found going through the bins at the venue holding the AGM for the RMT hoping to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acquire information.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref222" href="#footnote222">222</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-120"><a href="#para3-120" name="para3-120">3.120</a></p>
 The misappropriation of property is not confined to extracting documents out of bins,
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but includes the theft of photographs and physical items, such as diaries.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref223" href="#footnote223">223</a></sup> Mr McMullan</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained that he had been involved in the blagging his way into a property in France, stealing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a photograph off the mantelpiece, copying it and printing it in the NoTW.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref224" href="#footnote224">224</a></sup> The basis for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this misappropriation appears to be that it had not been possible to find a photograph in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public domain of the relevant individual. This conduct appears to be a gross invasion of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privacy; whether it was a breach of the criminal law has not been investigated. Further, Tom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rowland in his evidence explained that many photographs continued to be stolen today, albeit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">electronically, where watermarks and copyrights were sliced off the bottom of photographs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and used by newspapers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref225" href="#footnote225">225</a></sup></span>

 That said,</span> it is critically necessary to retaina sense of<span style="font-weight:normal;"> proportion, and consider the extent to
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which these types of practices still represent part of the culture, practices and ethics of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press. Whereas &#8216;binnology&#8217; and kindred practices did form part of the culture in the past, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is correct to say that there is insufficient evidence that it still occurs to any significant extent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, equally, insufficient material from which that inference might be drawn.</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">indicated to the Inquiry that they had previously paid officials for information,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref227" href="#footnote227">227</a></sup> although in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">each instance reliance would no doubt have been placed on the public interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-123"><a href="#para3-123" name="para3-123">3.123</a></p>
 Given the inevitable paucity of the information available which relates to each of these cases,
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and notwithstanding that neither the Bribery Act 2010, its predecessor legislation, nor aiding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and abetting misconduct in public office contain a public interest defence, I make no comment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on this evidence; I merely note that it was given. The Inquiry heard evidence of a somewhat</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">historical nature that, at some newspapers, it was expected that crime reporters would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pay sums of money to police officers in exchange for information. The evidential picture is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">incomplete but, again, the current state of the evidence does not enable any conclusions of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a generic nature to be reached.</span>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-124"><a href="#para3-124" name="para3-124">3.124</a></p>
I have concluded that the evidence seen and heard by the Inquiry is inconclusive, or
<span style="font-size: 15px;">insufficient, to find that bribery and corruption, blagging, theft and/or email hacking are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cultural problems within the press today but there is sufficient arising out of what has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said and the present criminal investigation to merit concern. Further, the evidence of these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices, limited though it is, does support a wider conclusion that there is a cultural problem</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within parts of the press with regard to the use of unethical methods to acquire private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-125"><a href="#para3-125" name="para3-125">3.125</a></p>
 The slow and often inadequate response by large parts of the press to the widely known

<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice of phone hacking, considered alongside the inadequate response to the Operation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Motorman revelations, indicates an industry which, in general, did not find it noteworthy or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particularly problematic that parts of the press were regularly breaching individual privacy,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not to mention the criminal law. In addition, the fact that large parts of the press continue to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">employ private investigators to carry out covert surveillance without any clear public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">supports the conclusion that, notwithstanding the evidence that phone hacking is likely to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have ceased as a method employed by journalists, the press retains a casual (or less than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">robust) attitude to the use of unethical methods of acquiring private information.</span>

<h2>4.  Breach of confidence and misuse of confidential and/ or sensitive information</h2>


<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition to the evidence demonstrating that the press has accessed private information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from individuals either unlawfully or unethically, the Inquiry heard significant evidence of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">misuse<span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> private</span><span style="font-style:normal"> information.</span><span style="font-style:normal"> That</span><span style="font-style:normal"> misuse</span><span style="font-style:normal"> has</span><span style="font-style:normal"> taken</span><span style="font-style:normal"> place</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> two</span><span style="font-style:normal"> ways:</span><span style="font-style:normal"> first,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> through</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">unjustified publication of that information.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As discussed above, Operation Motorman revealed an extensive trade in confidential data.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although there is evidence to suggest that that trade has significantly diminished, there are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasons to believe that at least a limited trade continues.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Notably, during the course of the Inquiry, the Guardian reported on the illegal trade of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">passenger flight information from an employee at Virgin Atlantic to the picture agency Big</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Pictures.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref228" href="#footnote228">228</a></sup> The article revealed that over the course of some considerable time (which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subsequently turned out to be a period of approximately two years),<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref229" href="#footnote229">229</a></sup> an employee within</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Virgin Atlantic had regularly disclosed to someone within Big Pictures the personal flight</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information of over 60 different celebrities. The strong inference was that Big Pictures used</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that information as an advantage over competitors when arranging for photographers to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pursue celebrities on holidays and other trips abroad.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Jillian Anne Brady, on behalf of Virgin Atlantic, told the Inquiry that Virgin&#8217;s internal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation had confirmed the flow of confidential information from Virgin to Big Pictures;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">she also confirmed that the employee in question had left her employment and that Virgin</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had reported to the ICO what had happened in its own operations.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref230" href="#footnote230">230</a></sup> It must be said that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">response by Virgin Atlantic to the revelation was exemplary, and there seems to have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very little more that the company could have done to prevent the disclosure. By contrast, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">same cannot be said of Big Pictures: for &#8220;legal reasons&#8221; they declined to provide the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with any further evidence of what had taken place.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref231" href="#footnote231">231</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The disclosure of personal flight information from an airline to a picture agency is both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unethical and unlawful and is consistent with the practices identified in Operation Motorman.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Notwithstanding the evidence from editors which suggested that the trade in private and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">confidential information had declined substantially since Operation Motorman, what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">happened between the Virgin and Big Pictures gives cause for concern and the fact must be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there is a market for pictures taken as a result. I doubt that it is the only recent example</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a trade in confidential information in which the press has an interest, and there is an</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">undoubted risk that a picture agency (or the paparazzi) will be used, whether knowingly or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not, as surrogates for the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thus, it will not be a journalist who obtains the information that provides the intelligence to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lead a photographer to a picture but it will be the photographer who does so, then selling the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">picture to the press with exactly the same outcome. Although the evidence received by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry did not establish that the press remain complicit in a trade in private and confidential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information, the picture appears to be complex. The evidence did suggest that third parties</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remain involved in the trade of confidential information, and then sell products based on that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">trade to the press. Ultimately, the press do remain responsible for the content it publishes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and therefore must remain on guard to ensure that information or photographs provided by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">third parties were obtained ethically.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-7"><a href="#para4-7" name="para4-7">4.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although there was no clear evidence that the press remain directly involved in the trade in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">confidential information, there was ample evidence to suggest that large parts of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were willing to publish confidential, private or sensitive information, without regard to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impact on the individuals concerned and without consideration of the public interest. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW&#8217;s publication of Dr McCann&#8217;s diaries is a prime example of this,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref232" href="#footnote232">232</a></sup> as is the publication</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry heard many other examples of the publication of confidential material. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Clifford gave evidence of the publication, without consent, of private photographs of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rebecca Leighton, the nurse falsely accused of poisoning patients at Stepping Hill Hospital.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Photographs of Ms Leighton in fancy dress were allegedly taken from her Facebook account</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and used in articles to suggest her guilt.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref234" href="#footnote234">234</a></sup> Similarly, Ms Mills told of how confidential details</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of her divorce settlement appeared in the national press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref235" href="#footnote235">235</a></sup> And Ms Rowling gave evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the publication of excerpts of a stolen advance copy of one of her novels.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref236" href="#footnote236">236</a></sup> None of these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examples of the publication of obviously private, confidential, or copyrighted material was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justified in the public interest.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furtherevidenceofawillingnesswithinthepresstopublishconfidentialorprivateinformation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">came from the examples of newspapers revealing pregnancies, or rumours of pregnancies,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prior to the 12 week period prescribed by the Editors&#8217; Code. The first pregnancies of both Ms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Diamond and Ms Church were revealed by the tabloid press before they had even informed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their families.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref237" href="#footnote237">237</a></sup> Ms Witchalls&#8217; pregnancy (of only five weeks gestation) was revealed while</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">she was unconscious and before she or anyone other than her medical team and immediate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">family knew about it.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref238" href="#footnote238">238</a></sup> That kind of disclosure in the national press is not only a breach of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Editors&#8217; Code but displays a complete disregard for individual privacy, and a lack of respect for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inherently private and sensitive information.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-10"><a href="#para4-10" name="para4-10">4.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A similar type of disclosure which caused significant distress for a number of witnesses was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the disclosure by newspapers of a person&#8217;s address, or of sufficient information to allow a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reader to identify the person&#8217;s address. While an address is not necessarily confidential, it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ordinarily private and is certainly sensitive. For a number of witnesses, the disclosure of their</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">addresses in the national press occurred with no reasonable justification and gave rise to very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">real concerns for personal safety. Ms Church&#8217;s address was disclosed at a time when she was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the subject of death threats.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref239" href="#footnote239">239</a></sup> Ms Rowling&#8217;s address was revealed along with the details of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her the security features which she had deployed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref240" href="#footnote240">240</a></sup> Ms Diamond&#8217;s address was published,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">along with a complete layout and description of her home. As Ms Diamond wrote:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">What is clear from all of these examples &#8211; the publication of confidential material without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consent, the revelation of pregnancies before individuals had told friends and families, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the publication of individuals&#8217; home addresses &#8211; is that the publication of stories which on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any reasonable analysis may fairly be described as inconsequential can cause very real harm</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the individuals concerned.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-12"><a href="#para4-12" name="para4-12">4.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Perhaps the most egregious instances of the disclosure of confidential information were the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">four examples heard by the Inquiry of a willingness of the press to disclose private medical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information. This type of information is deserving of the highest protection. The story</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">surrounding the revelation of the condition of the Rt Hon Gordon Brown&#8217;s son is discussed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in detail above.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref243" href="#footnote243">243</a></sup> Second, Mr Grant referred to two episodes in which his private medical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information was published. In 1996, the Daily Mirror reported his visit to see a specialist</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at Charing Cross hospital and included within the story his diagnosis and treatment. More</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recently, in March 2011, his visit to the A&E department at Chelsea and Westminster hospital</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was reported in The Sun and the Daily Express.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref244" href="#footnote244">244</a></sup> Included in those articles was his exact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaint; Mr Grant&#8217;s view was that the information must have come straight from his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">medical records and, in all likelihood, from a paid source within the hospital.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref245" href="#footnote245">245</a></sup> Although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was insufficient information to conclude for certain how the information was obtained,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the purposes of the Inquiry, it does not matter. The simple fact is that private medical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information was published without consent and without regard to the public interest (or, at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">least, any reasonable formulation of the public interest).</span>

<p id="para-id-4-13"><a href="#para4-13" name="para4-13">4.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Third, and as already referenced in the previous section of the Report, former NoTW journalist</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Driscoll gave evidence of how the paper blagged the medical records of a Premiership</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">football manager and used that information to bargain with the manager for cooperation on</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">future stories. Notwithstanding the fact that the medical records were likely to have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obtained unlawfully and their disclosure was likely to have been an actionable tort, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper successfully persuaded the manager that, in return for the newspaper keeping</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the medical records private, he would cooperate with the newspaper by providing stories in</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">future.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-14"><a href="#para4-14" name="para4-14">4.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The final example of a willingness within parts of the press to obtain and disclose private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">medical information was the evidence provided by the filmmaker Chris Atkins, in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the &#8216;medical records sting&#8217; in his film<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;Starsuckers&#8217;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref246" href="#footnote246">246</a></sup> Mr Atkins had posed as the boyfriend of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a woman who worked in a cosmetic surgery in Harley Street. He called a number of tabloid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers to say that he might be willing to sell information about the procedures carried</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out to various celebrities. A journalist from the Daily Express immediately dismissed the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposal a contrary to the Editors&#8217; Code and ended the conversation. Journalists from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">People, the NoTW and the Daily Mirror arranged a meeting to discuss.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Atkin&#8217;s meeting with the Daily Mirror&#8217;s Nick Owens was equally illuminating and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">revealed a distinct lack of respect for the dignity of individuals whose medical information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was purportedly for sale. During their meeting, Mr Owens asked Mr Atkins to provide as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">much information as possible on the cosmetic procedures carried out to named celebrities.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although he told Mr Atkins that the publication of medical information was problematic for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the newspaper because of the Editors&#8217; Code restrictions, he said that such publication could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be justified if the stories were in the public interest. However, the transcript of the meeting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">revealed his deeply flawed understanding of the public interest. He said, for instance that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;there probably isn&#8217;t a public interest in&#8230; just reporting that someone had a gastric band</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">operation, unless they are a massively big name then you might make a decision.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref250" href="#footnote250">250</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Similarly,</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when discussing various fictional procedures of which Mr Atkins offered to provide further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information, Mr Owens thought that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> could</span><span style="font-style:italic"> get</span><span style="font-style:italic"> away</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with&#8221;</span> a story of an actress having</span>

<p id="para-id-4-17"><a href="#para4-17" name="para4-17">4.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The claim that the revelation of private medical information about a celebrity could be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justified in the public interest because the celebrity is particularly famous, or because the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">story is funny or because the celebrity does not, in the journalist&#8217;s opinion, need a procedure,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is frankly ludicrous. A sympathetic interpretation of Mr Owens&#8217; comments is that he was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">merely &#8216;thinking aloud&#8217; and had given the issue very little thought. But that, perhaps, is the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">problem. What is clear from the transcript is that Mr Owens, an award winning and senior</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalist with considerable experience,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref253" href="#footnote253">253</a></sup> was engaged in a conversation directed at eliciting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from Mr Atkins as much confidential medical information as possible to see whether the Daily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mirror might be able to use it in some way. What is also clear is that he had decided to engage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in that conversation without considering the very many ethical questions that ought to have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been contemplated in advance.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">appeared to claim that he had arranged the meeting with Mr Atkins with a view to potentially</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">simply not credible. As Mr Barr noted in questioning, prior to the meeting Mr Owens had not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discussed it with his news desk; neither had he, in any way, recorded any intention to carry</span>

<p id="para-id-4-19"><a href="#para4-19" name="para4-19">4.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The transcript of the meeting between Mr Atkins and Mr Owens reveals a journalist intent on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">receiving information which was plainly confidential and obviously private. It may well be the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case that Mr Owens had not formed any firm view about whether it would be appropriate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to purchase or publish the information; and it appears that after the meeting Mr Owens</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not pursue Mr Atkins with any vigour. But that is not the point. An offer to sell private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">medical information about celebrities should have been rejected outright: the Daily Express</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">got it right, while Sarah Jellema formerly of the People, and Mr Owens got it wrong. Absent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an intention to expose, by meeting with Mr Atkins and by encouraging him to access and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provide medical records to substantiate his claims, Mr Owens acted in a way which showed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no respect for the confidentiality of medical records and inherent privacy of the individuals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in question.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-20"><a href="#para4-20" name="para4-20">4.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence when considered as a whole suggests that there is a cultural willingness in parts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press to receive and publish confidential and private information. The evidence also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggests that those same parts of the press have done so without consideration of the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest, or with a conception of the public interest that is fundamentally flawed.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One of the recurring complaints advanced by the Core Participant Victims was that the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">attention they received from the press and paparazzi amounted, at times, to harassment.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Miller gave the most striking description of her harassment as she recalled frequently</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">is dealt with in more detail above.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref256" href="#footnote256">256</a></sup> Similarly, the evidence of Ms Church,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref257" href="#footnote257">257</a></sup> Ms Rowling,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref258" href="#footnote258">258</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Mr Coogan<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref259" href="#footnote259">259</a></sup> contained further examples of persistent, intrusive and distressing levels</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of attention by press and paparazzi. Furthermore, the evidence of the McCanns,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref260" href="#footnote260">260</a></sup> the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dowlers<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref261" href="#footnote261">261</a></sup> and Baroness Hollins<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref262" href="#footnote262">262</a></sup> illustrated that complaints of harassment were not limited</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to so-called celebrities, but were shared by those with no public persona who, for a variety of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasons, were thrust into the public eye.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Grant described a series of events in the months before and after the birth of his daughter</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">After the birth of her child, Ms Hong received numerous phone calls, text messages and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">answer-phone messages from journalists.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref265" href="#footnote265">265</a></sup> Despite requests for them to leave, up to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ten photographers and journalists remained camped outside her house, day and night.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref266" href="#footnote266">266</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The photographers spoke with neighbours and sought to persuade them to call Ms Hong</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for information about her baby.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref267" href="#footnote267">267</a></sup> When Ms Hong left the house, she was pursued by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographers. On one occasion, on 10 November 2011, Ms Hong called her mother for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assistancetopreventthepursuitofphotographers.Hermotherattemptedtotakephotographs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of one of them but, in response, he sped his car towards her in a menacing manner, forcing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her to jump out of the way.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref268" href="#footnote268">268</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-4"><a href="#para5-4" name="para5-4">5.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The harassment experienced by Ms Hong and her family appeared motivated by one thing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only: the pursuit of a photograph of, or statement about, Mr Grant&#8217;s new baby. But the impact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on Ms Hong and her family was significant. She told the High Court that she was seriously</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intimidated and distressed by the experience. She had been unable to look after her daughter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in a normal way, had had to cancel appointments and was frightened to drive with her child</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for fear that pursuit by paparazzi would make it unsafe to do so.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref269" href="#footnote269">269</a></sup> She was under virtual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">house arrest. Whatever one thinks of the justification for publishing information about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private lives of so-called celebrities, there can be no justification for harassing a new mother</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and her child in this way.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Gascoigne provided evidence of similar levels of harassment. As the ex-wife of footballer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Paul Gascoigne, she accepted that, by contracting for coverage of her wedding, appearing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on shows such as &#8220;I&#8217;m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!&#8221;, and by selling a book about her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private life, she could only have a limited expectation of privacy. As a consequence she did</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">not complain about the publication of details of her private life,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref270" href="#footnote270">270</a></sup> but she did complain of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the harassment that she had endured by journalists and photographers. She recalled that in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the 1990s, when she was in a relationship with Mr Gascoigne, she was pursued relentlessly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by photographers who would often drive dangerously to follow her. In order to end these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pursuits, she would drive around roundabouts multiple times or drive into housing estates;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on one occasion, concerned for the safety of her children, she was forced to drive to a police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">station to end the harassment. In 1996, when the curtains in her home would not close</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">properly, she was forced to crawl on her hands and knees to prevent photographs being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken through the windows by multiple photographers camped outside.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref271" href="#footnote271">271</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-6"><a href="#para5-6" name="para5-6">5.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although Ms Gascoigne noted that things improved slightly in the aftermath of the death of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">by paparazzi were still very common. One of his clients, Lily Allen, had recently been involved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in an accident where a photographer had driven through a red light and smashed into her car.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As she emerged from the car, instead of apologising, the photographer took photographs of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the singer in distress.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref273" href="#footnote273">273</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-7"><a href="#para5-7" name="para5-7">5.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Darryn Lyons of Big Pictures photo agency confirmed stories from his book &#8216;Mr Paparazzi&#8217;. He</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">He also wrote of the widely used technique for getting car shots:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref275" href="#footnote275">275</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the police who were making a complaint about a couple of my big guys. They were</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">stalking, pursuing and chasing Ms Mills in a variety of situations, some of which are obviously</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private, and some of which appear to show photographers driving dangerously. Ms Mills</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complained of journalists sitting outside her home with scanning equipment, paparazzi hiding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and jumping out at her daughter and her without notice, and chasing her in her car. The</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Neil Turner of the British Press Photographers&#8217; Association said that the industry faced a real</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;they do involve chasing people down the road, driving dangerously/illegally. They</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">do involve initiating a reaction and a response from people to get different facial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expressions, you know, in a kind of completely over-the-top way. They do involve</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the trying to photograph women in compromising ways to show you either &#8211; what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they&#8217;re wearing under their skirts.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8230;Working in packs deliberately. Deliberately running in front of people. I mean,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you know, hearsay, I&#8217;m afraid, but I&#8217;ve heard it second-hand that they&#8217;ve seen one</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">photographer deliberately get into a fight with a celebrity so a second photographer,</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with whom they were working as a team, could get the picture of the fight and split</span>

<p id="para-id-5-12"><a href="#para5-12" name="para5-12">5.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When asked whether he doubted the truth of the evidence given by some of the Core</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">any of it.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref287" href="#footnote287">287</a></sup> His explanation for this kind of behaviour was simple: there was demand in the</span>

<p id="para-id-5-13"><a href="#para5-13" name="para5-13">5.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That appeared to reflect the evidence given by witnesses representing picture agencies.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Gary Morgan, from Splash picture agency, confirmed that the market places a premium on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exclusive photographs of individuals in the public eye. Photographs taken at press events or</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">present.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref289" href="#footnote289">289</a></sup> As such, there is an incentive on photographers to push the boundaries of what is</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Lyons confirmed that in order to get valuable photographs his photographers, or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">freelancers, would pursue individuals by car or scooter, and would use the aggressive car</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">shot technique described above.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref290" href="#footnote290">290</a></sup> Matthew Sprake, of Newspics, confirmed that he happily</span>

<p id="para-id-5-15"><a href="#para5-15" name="para5-15">5.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">What was striking about the evidence received from Mr Morgan, Mr Lyons and Mr Sprake</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was that apparently Splash, Big Pictures and Newspics did not have any code of practice</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear that each photo agency had very limited control or oversight over the behaviour of the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of greater concern was the evidence from Mr Sprake and Mr Lyons which demonstrated a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lack of consideration for the privacy and dignity of the subjects of their photographers. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sprake&#8217;s evidence revealed that ethical considerations about privacy and harassment played</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a very limited role in the planning and execution of photographic assignments: if a newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commissioned his agency to get photographs proving rumours of a new relationship or affair,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proving the accuracy or otherwise of the rumour was the primary consideration, and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">avoidance of harassment or breaches of privacy appeared to be very much secondary in his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thinking.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref294" href="#footnote294">294</a></sup> Mr Lyons&#8217; evidence indicated a general disregard for the dignity of individuals in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public eye. In his book &#8216;Mr Paparazzi&#8217;, he had said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref295" href="#footnote295">295</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;All these truths about the nature of celebrity mean that when Big Pictures is out</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there papping the stars, some will claim that to an extent we&#8217;re imposing on their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">privacy and causing them some kind of distress. My answer to that is simple: if you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">can&#8217;t hack the job, don&#8217;t wear the hat.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-17"><a href="#para5-17" name="para5-17">5.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">His evidence to the Inquiry largely confirmed that view. Asked about a series of privacy and/</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or harassment judgments made against Big Pictures, Mr Lyons was either unable to recall</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the details, gave inaccurate details,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref296" href="#footnote296">296</a></sup> or was unwilling to accept that Big Pictures had acted</span>

<p id="para-id-5-18"><a href="#para5-18" name="para5-18">5.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of witnesses suggested that it was often difficult to tell whether an individual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photograph taken by a freelance paparazzo amounted to a breach of privacy and/or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">harassment of the subject. Although this may sometimes be so in relation to an individual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photograph viewed in isolation, I suspect that very often the press are supplied with a series</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of photographs taken on the same occasion, and that it may not be overly difficult for an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">experienced picture editor to make informed judgments based on an overall impression.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-19"><a href="#para5-19" name="para5-19">5.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Assessed in the round, the evidence indicated a significant regulatory gap in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent or freelance paparazzi and press photographers. It is important to recognise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the symbiotic relationship between the press and paparazzi. As Mr Turner noted, it is the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press that creates much of the market for paparazzi photographs. Clause 4 of the Editors&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Code requires editors to ensure they do not use material which derives from intimidation,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">harassment or persistent pursuit. If that principle were applied properly, and newspapers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">refused to purchase or publish those images taken in situations of harassment, one might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expect a substantial reduction in harassing behaviour from independent and freelance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographers. As witnesses such as Sir John Major suggested to the Inquiry, newspapers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be held strictly accountable in the context of the Editors&#8217; Code for the photographs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they chose to publish, regardless of their source. Furthermore, it should be standard practice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to require newspapers to print the name of the photographer or the agency against any</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">published photograph.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-20"><a href="#para5-20" name="para5-20">5.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thatsaid,thepreponderanceoftheevidenceprovidedbynewspaperphoto-editorssuggested</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that most newspaper titles do scrutinise the photographs submitted to them by agencies</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and freelancers, do reject those photographs which appear to have been taken in breach of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Editors&#8217; Code, and do seek to regulate the behaviour of their employed photographers.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The problem which the evidence has identified is therefore one which demands careful</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consideration.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-21"><a href="#para5-21" name="para5-21">5.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Silva gave evidence of one of the more comprehensive systems for managing and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">monitoring the behaviour of photographers. His employed and freelance photographers are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given strict guidelines on how to conduct themselves, often tailored to the specific tasks</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allocated.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref301" href="#footnote301">301</a></sup> In relation to photographs submitted by freelancers, he identified 11 different</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">factors that were considered before deciding to publish.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref302" href="#footnote302">302</a></sup> Most of these considerations were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sensible and praiseworthy: for how long was the photographer taking photographs; was the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subject aware they were being photographed; was the subject harassed in any way? One was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more problematic. Mr Silva would consider whether the subject of the photograph was in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public or private place but his view, which he had not discussed with his editor or with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC, was that there would be no reasonable expectation of privacy on a public street.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref303" href="#footnote303">303</a></sup> The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">natural consequence of that approach is that those in the public eye are unable to exit their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">homes without the threat of intrusion by photographers. Nonetheless, overall, the factors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered by Mr Silva were exemplary and, applied consistently, ought to prevent much of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the harassment complained of.</span>

 <p id="para-id-5-22"><a href="#para5-22" name="para5-22">5.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Silva gave examples of how the application of these principles had often led to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rejection of photographs submitted to the Daily Mail, including: photographs of a member of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Royal Family and a celebrity were rejected because the subjects may have been followed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prior to the photograph; a photograph of a celebrity entering another celebrity&#8217;s home was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rejected because Mr Silva was unhappy that a photographer was outside the celebrity&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">home; pictures of a celebrity holding a baby were rejected because they were shot through</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a second floor window and were clearly intrusive.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref304" href="#footnote304">304</a></sup> Those examples suggested an effective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system in place to discourage or prevent harassment.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-23"><a href="#para5-23" name="para5-23">5.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Sun&#8217;s picture editor John Edwards was not able clearly to identify the list of factors taken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into account when deciding whether to publish photographs, but his evidence was that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">too took care to review photographs prior to publication to ensure they did not breach privacy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and were not taken in situations of harassment. He had rejected photographs of, for example,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a well-known singer attending cancer treatment, photographs of a TV presenter taking her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">children to school, and a photograph of a heavily pregnant Ms Allen in a public street.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref305" href="#footnote305">305</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-24"><a href="#para5-24" name="para5-24">5.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Michael Lidbury of the Daily Express,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref306" href="#footnote306">306</a></sup> Liz Cocks of the Mail on Sunday,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref307" href="#footnote307">307</a></sup> and Mark Moylan of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the People<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref308" href="#footnote308">308</a></sup> gave evidence of slightly different approaches to managing staff photographers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and assessing photographs sent in by freelancers, but all three shared a general approach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which suggested that care was taken to avoid harassment, and/or to avoid the publication of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographs taken in situations of harassment.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-25"><a href="#para5-25" name="para5-25">5.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence of picture editors was nonetheless concerning. There appears to be a gap</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between the in-principle approach discussed by the picture editors and the experiences of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those who have been subjected to harassment, as described above. From the oral evidence</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Mr Silva and Mr Edwards,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref309" href="#footnote309">309</a></sup> it appeared that the Editors&#8217; Code and/or the self-imposed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principles for preventing harassment are not applied as consistently as all the evidence from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the picture editors might have suggested.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-26"><a href="#para5-26" name="para5-26">5.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In relation to the harassment of Ms Hong, Mr Edwards accepted that there was no rational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">difference between photographs of a heavily pregnant Ms Hong on a public street and a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">heavily pregnant Ms Allen on a public street. In his written evidence, Mr Edwards highlighted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he had chosen not to publish the photograph of Ms Allen because he was sensitive to her</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sun&#8217;s publication of photographs of Ms Hong in an advanced stage of pregnancy, at a time</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when she was regularly pursued by photographers, without reference to her and without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consideration of her privacy or concerns for harassment. He could not adequately explain</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Similarly, in Mr Silva&#8217;s written evidence he had highlighted the fact that he had previously</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rejected photographs taken outside a celebrity&#8217;s home on the basis that he was unhappy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the photographer was stationed outside their home.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref312" href="#footnote312">312</a></sup> However, in the case of Ms Hong,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">undermines the claims of a number of newspapers that the photographers were simply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">waiting to see if Ms Hong would willingly pose for a photograph with the child. If there were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any doubt about that, Mr Grant made clear that she would not do so but the photographers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remained nonetheless.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-29"><a href="#para5-29" name="para5-29">5.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The individual decisions of the Daily Mail and The Sun to publish a photograph of a heavily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pregnant Ms Hong on a public street, or like the other newspapers who did the same, to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">send a single photographer to her house shortly after she had given birth, may not have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">led inevitably to harassment. But the collective decisions of numerous photo-editors, photo-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">agencies and freelance paparazzi, certainly did. And it is this collective responsibility which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">often gives rise to the problem.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-30"><a href="#para5-30" name="para5-30">5.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In relation to the publication of photographs of Ms Hong, Mr Edwards argued that there could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be no reasonable objection to the publication of a single photograph of an individual taken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in a public place which did not appear to be taken in circumstances of harassment. In the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">abstract, that must be correct. But, very often, for the subject of the photograph, that single</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photograph taken in a single public place will be one of many photographs taken in many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public places by many photographers, over a course of many weeks, months or years. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those circumstances the &#8220;single&#8221; photograph in a &#8220;single&#8221; public place may not evidence any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">harassment precisely because the harassment is evidenced by the cumulative experience. I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognise that this makes it very difficult for editors and photo-editors to assess the ethics</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref312" name="footnote312" title="Go back to footnote reference 312 in the text">312</a>.  In a subsequent letter to the Inquiry, sent after Inquiry had concluded its evidence gathering phase, Mr Silvaclaimed that he had different reasons for rejecting that particular photograph, namely that there was evidence thatthe celebrity had been followed.

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">of publishing a particular photograph, but assess these they must. And, in doing so, one of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the important considerations is the collective and/or cumulative impact of the decisions of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">numerous titles to take or publish photographs of the same subject. If that is in doubt, a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">phone call to the representative of the subject, much like the phone call Mr Edwards made to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Allen&#8217;s PR , may provide an answer.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-31"><a href="#para5-31" name="para5-31">5.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">With regard to the presence of multiple photographers outside Ms Hong&#8217;s home, all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">competing for a photograph, and unwilling to leave when requested, it is difficult to see how</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that can be justified as ethical or Code-compliant behaviour. All photo-editors responsible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for sending photographers to Ms Hong&#8217;s home must have been aware that it was highly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">likely that there would be a pack of photographers outside her house, and that the situation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could be oppressive for the new mother.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref318" href="#footnote318">318</a></sup> In that context, and when Mr Grant made it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear that photographers were not welcome, it is difficult to understand why, applying the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">general principles contained in all of the picture editors&#8217; evidence, the photographers present</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remained at the house until the PCC issued a desist request to all newspaper editors.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-32"><a href="#para5-32" name="para5-32">5.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although Colin Myler praised the effectiveness of PCC desist notices in circumstances like</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those endured by Ms Hong,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref319" href="#footnote319">319</a></sup> the need to issue such a notice reflects a failure on the part</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of editors to ensure that their photographers comply with the code of conduct to which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the titles are committed. If the PCC can see that a situation of harassment has developed,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsible editors should recognise that fact too.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-33"><a href="#para5-33" name="para5-33">5.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The harassment experienced by the McCanns on their return from Portugal, discussed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">above<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref320" href="#footnote320">320</a></sup> is another prime example of where responsible editors and photo-editors could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not reasonably claim to have been unaware of the harassment experienced, but where</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">employed and freelance photographers, as well as journalists, were sent to pursue the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">McCanns nonetheless. Mr Edwards could see in retrospect that the situation they faced was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unacceptable<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref321" href="#footnote321">321</a></sup> but, at the time, he had sent his photographer to join the pack who had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gathered outside their house. Mr Silva also acknowledged that, with hindsight, &#8220;possibly&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some of the photographs (in particular those featuring unpixellated images of the McCann</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">children) should not have been used,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref322" href="#footnote322">322</a></sup> but noted that the story was &#8220;unique&#8221;, &#8220;intense&#8221; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one of the most difficult he had had to work on.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref323" href="#footnote323">323</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-34"><a href="#para5-34" name="para5-34">5.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In my view, there are a number of reasons why there is such a disjunction between the general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principles articulated by photo-editors to prevent harassment and the specific examples of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">harassment heard by the Inquiry. I accept that a good deal of the harassment experienced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by those in the public eye is caused by unregulated freelancers. I also accept that the British</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press has only limited influence over those freelancers: although the British press can reduce</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the market for photographs obtained in situations of harassment, the harassers can still sell</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into the international market.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref318" name="footnote318" title="Go back to footnote reference 318 in the text">318</a>.  In addition, whether Mr Silva, in particular, knew it or not, Daily Mail journalists had been calling Ms Hongrepeatedly and leaving messages on her answer-phone; in consequence she already felt pressured by journalists. MrSilva&#8217;s evidence and subsequent letter to the Inquiry did not address this broader context, but it is another example ofhow the experience of harassment may be cumulative and cannot be considered without regard to that wider context</p><!--footnote-->

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref322" name="footnote322" title="Go back to footnote reference 322 in the text">322</a>.  It seems clear that at least some of the photographs showing the McCann children were taken with the consent ofthe McCann family</p><!--footnote-->

 <p id="para-id-5-35"><a href="#para5-35" name="para5-35">5.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, it is clear from the evidence provided to the Inquiry that not all of the blame for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">harassment of those in the public eye can be levelled at the unregulated freelance paparazzi.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The British press has been guilty of publishing photographs clearly taken in circumstances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of harassment, and employed photographers and journalists have been guilty of harassing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behaviour. It is possible that, contrary to the evidence given to the Inquiry, editors and photo-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editors do not, in general, take care to avoid harassment.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-36"><a href="#para5-36" name="para5-36">5.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Taking this in the round, I believe that the evidence provided to the Inquiry by photo-editors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was essentially genuine, and that photo-editors and editors alike do, in general, try to take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">care to avoid situations of harassment. However, there appear to be two general factors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which conspire against that care which means that the harassment of individuals continues.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, some of the harassment experienced by witnesses to the Inquiry is the consequence of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">collective and cumulative decisions by photo-editors and editors, rather than single obvious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breaches of the Editors&#8217; Code: each individual publication&#8217;s decision might appear justified,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but the collective and cumulative decisions of many editors over a period of time are not.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Editors must face up to this problem.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-37"><a href="#para5-37" name="para5-37">5.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In a letter to the Inquiry, Mr Edwards referred to the treatment of the McCanns on their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">return from Portugal, acknowledging again that the situation was unacceptable. He blamed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it on a &#8220;collective&#8221; problem for which television crews and international press were also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsible, but defended The Sun, denying that it had made any inappropriate publication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision. That cannot be right in circumstances where The Sun had a photographer within the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pack outside the McCanns&#8217; home. It is one thing to say that there is a collective problem and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">we are all responsible. It is another thing entirely to say that there is a collective problem, and</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">therefore we cannot be held responsible individually.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-38"><a href="#para5-38" name="para5-38">5.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, it seems that where a story is too big, as in the case of the McCanns, or where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a readership&#8217;s interest in a celebrity is too great, as in the case of Mr Grant, the general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principles applied to avoid harassment are relaxed, or even set to one side. That is consistent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Piers Morgan&#8217;s observation in a note to Assistant Chief Constable Jeremy Kirkby that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Fame and crime sends most of the usual rules out of the window&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref324" href="#footnote324">324</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> It</span><span style="font-style:normal"> is</span><span style="font-style:normal"> also</span><span style="font-style:normal"> consistent</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with two observations made in other parts of this Report: first, that where the perceived</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">imperatives of very big stories are concerned, there is a tendency to disregard the rule book,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and second, that there has been, within parts of the press, a conflation of the public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with what interests the public, such that individual privacy and dignity is ignored to satisfy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the demands of a readership.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref325" href="#footnote325">325</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Peppiatt&#8217;s evidence appeared to support this conclusion. He told of his pursuit of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Britain&#8217;s Got Talent<span style="font-style:normal"> star</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Susan</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Boyle,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> at</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span><span style="font-style:normal"> time</span><span style="font-style:normal"> when</span><span style="font-style:normal"> there</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> huge</span><span style="font-style:normal"> international</span><span style="font-style:normal"> interest</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in her story. Under enormous pressure after her sudden rise to fame, Ms Boyle had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acting unpredictably and &#8220;lashing out&#8221;. The producers of<span style="font-style:italic"> Britain&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Got</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Talent</span> had sent her to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Scotland for some time out to relax and recover and the press were expressly asked to leave</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her alone. Mr Peppiatt recalled that this request was &#8220;like a red rag to a bull&#8221; for the Daily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Star, which sent him to Scotland to pursue her and to make a mock marriage proposal. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Peppiatt spent a week pursuing Ms Boyle around Scotland before making the mock proposal,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undoubtedly adding to the stress she was under. Mr Peppiatt said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref326" href="#footnote326">326</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-1"><a href="#para6-1" name="para6-1">6.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Partly a subset of harassment, a further complaint that has been levelled at the press is that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it has shown insufficient respect for the special sensitivity of those grieving the death of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those close to them, or in shock from tragic events. The press intrusion experienced by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">McCanns, the Dowlers, and the Bowles family,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref327" href="#footnote327">327</a></sup> are some of the more high profile examples</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of this complaint. But the Inquiry heard evidence of many more examples.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">As historic context, Disaster Action, a charity founded by the survivors and bereaved of</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">But it is to the eternal discredit of The Sun that we reported as fact this misinformation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which tarnished the reputation of Liverpool fans including the 96 victims. ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The role of a newspaper is to uncover injustice. To forensically examine the claims</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">made by those who are in positions of power. In the aftermath of the Hillsborough</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">tragedy we failed. And by failing in our duty we heaped more misery on the families</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of those who lost their lives and the people of Liverpool.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Nothing can excuse The Sun&#8217;s Page One presentation, under the heading The Truth.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It was inaccurate, grossly insensitive and offensive. This version of events was NOT</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the truth.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-5"><a href="#para6-5" name="para6-5">6.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The extent of this egregious failure, now fully recognised (but not previously in the 23 years</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that have elapsed), exemplifies many of the concerns which have been ventilated in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry, not the least in relation to the intrusion into grief and shock, but also in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accuracy (discussed below). It also underlines the enormous power of the press and, as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consequence, its absolute obligation to exercise that power responsibly. The press has real</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">influence in our society and is given privileges in law in order to fulfil its function. The story</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">underlines the need for a regulatory mechanism to challenge the press and to require it to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justify itself.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-6"><a href="#para6-6" name="para6-6">6.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If the Hillsborough reporting represented large scale intrusion into grief and shock, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry heard extensive evidence of smaller scale, but equally distressing coverage of death</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and tragedy. Margaret and James Watson told the Inquiry of the insensitive reporting of their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">daughter&#8217;s murder by a fellow student in the 1980s. The articles published in the Glasgow</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Herald and in Marie Claire magazine, which, contrary to the clear conclusions expressed at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">trial, sought to portray their daughter&#8217;s murderer as a victim and their daughter as involved in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a feud with the murderer, caused the couple and their son immense anguish which was still</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clearly felt when they gave evidence.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref333" href="#footnote333">333</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-7"><a href="#para6-7" name="para6-7">6.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Similar anguish was caused by the reporting of the death of Ms Diamond&#8217;s son in 1991. Only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an hour after Ms Diamond found her son dead, photographers and journalists began to knock</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at her door. The pack that arrived was so large that the family priest was too intimidated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to enter the house. A photographer was seen sitting on Ms Diamond&#8217;s back wall, trying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to photograph the grieving family in their garden; a journalist tried to force her way into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the house on the pretence of delivering flowers. Despite the family&#8217;s express requests for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the funeral to be private, a freelance photographer took photos of Ms Diamond and her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">husband with their son&#8217;s coffin. Further, despite express requests not to do so, The Sun ran</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the photograph on its front page the following day. Ms Diamond recalled the series of events</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a great violation of her privacy and an enormous intrusion into her private grief.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref334" href="#footnote334">334</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-8"><a href="#para6-8" name="para6-8">6.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It might be said that the evidence of Ms Diamond, along with that of the Watsons and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Hillsborough example, are of purely historical interest, given that they each relate to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publications more than 20 years ago. But the evidence heard by the Inquiry does not support</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that view. The experiences of the McCanns, the Dowlers and the Bowles family, all of which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occurred much more recently, suggest that parts of the press can continue, on occasion, to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">display a cavalier attitude to intrusions into shock or grief.</span>

 <p id="para-id-6-9"><a href="#para6-9" name="para6-9">6.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Evidence from other witnesses supports that view as well. Shortly after Mr Mosley&#8217;s son died</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in 2009, up to 15 journalists and/or photographers camped outside his son&#8217;s home, hoping</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to snap a photograph of Mr Mosley exiting the house. Only after his solicitors threatened</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to bring an action for harassment did the journalists leave.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref335" href="#footnote335">335</a></sup> Similar evidence was given to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Culture Media and Sport (CMS) Select Committee by Tim Fuller, the father of a girl who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had committed suicide in 2008 and who had been unable to go to his daughter&#8217;s house for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">days after her death because it was surrounded by press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref336" href="#footnote336">336</a></sup> Likewise, in the aftermath of her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">daughter&#8217;s stabbing, Baroness Hollins was door-stepped by journalists and photographers,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subject to subterfuge by journalists pretending to be doctors, and photographed with long</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lens cameras while on private family outings.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref337" href="#footnote337">337</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-10"><a href="#para6-10" name="para6-10">6.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The harassment and intrusion of which these witnesses complained appears to be borne</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from a culture of indifference, within parts of the press, to the sensitivities of those who are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">grieving or in shock; that indifference is doubtless borne out of an anxiety to capture the &#8216;big&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story. Mr Peppiatt gave evidence of a story he had written immediately after the suicide of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Kevin McGee, the ex-partner of television personality Matt Lucas. On the day of Mr McGee&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">death, the Daily Star was telephoned by a source who made sensational claims about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">drug and alcohol abuse that had caused Mr McGee&#8217;s death. The source also alleged that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Lucas was on suicide watch himself. Although Mr Peppiatt was keen to meet the source</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to verify the claims, he was told to write and publish the story immediately without further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">checking. Prior to publication, no consideration was given to the sensitivity of those close</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Mr McGee, nor apparently to the truth of the story. Mr Peppiatt noted that within the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;there</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> certainly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> consideration</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> man</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> dead,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> therefore</span><span style="font-style:italic"> you</span><span style="font-style:italic"> can&#8217;t</span></span>

<p id="para-id-6-11"><a href="#para6-11" name="para6-11">6.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Peppiatt recalled that he expected to be disciplined in some way in the aftermath of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">litigation for his part in the story. But no internal inquiries were made and no disciplinary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">action taken. Mr Peppiatt considered that the attitude of the newspaper was that the damages</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">award was simply part of the cost of doing business.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref340" href="#footnote340">340</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-12"><a href="#para6-12" name="para6-12">6.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Daily Mail&#8217;s Mr Dacre was asked about an article on the death of Boyzone singer, Stephen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Gately, which had given rise to over 25,000 PCC complaints. A post-mortem examination had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">found Mr Gately to have died of natural causes. The article speculated, with some conviction</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but no factual basis, that his death could not have been natural, but must have been linked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to a &#8220;dangerous&#8221; homosexual lifestyle. His death was associated with the death of Mr McGee</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and was said to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> strike</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> blow</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> happy-ever-after</span><span style="font-style:italic"> myth</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> civil</span><span style="font-style:italic"> partnerships</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref341" href="#footnote341">341</a></sup> In his</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">more judicious sub-editing, but he defended the journalist&#8217;s right to express her view in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref342" href="#footnote342">342</a></sup> The PCC adopted the same approach, criticising parts of the article but deciding</span>

<p id="para-id-6-13"><a href="#para6-13" name="para6-13">6.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The conclusion of the PCC is surprising. A columnist is, of course, entitled freely to express his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or her views. But where those views had no factual basis, were expressed very shortly after</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Gately&#8217;s death, and intruded into the grief of those who loved him, it is difficult to see how</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that did not amount to a breach of the requirements of the Editors&#8217; Code that newspapers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should handle sensitively stories which intrude on personal grief or shock. In any case, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication of the story, which the PCC recognised was in poor taste, displayed a disregard for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the grief of the friends and family of Mr Gately.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-14"><a href="#para6-14" name="para6-14">6.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There may be some truth in the old chestnut that &#8220;if it bleeds, it leads&#8221;. The reporting of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">crime, and the reporting of the death of those in the public eye, will always be an important</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and valuable part of the press. As noted by Baroness Hollins, the majority of the press achieve</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this with sensitivity and care.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref344" href="#footnote344">344</a></sup> But it is clear to me that a significant minority does not. To</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that minority, death or tragedy is treated as just another news story, to be reported without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regard to the special considerations that ought to apply to protect the friends and family of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the subjects of the stories.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-15"><a href="#para6-15" name="para6-15">6.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">To address the failings of this minority, Mr and Mrs Watson proposed a change in the law</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to allow the family of the dead to sue for libel.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref345" href="#footnote345">345</a></sup> It is an interesting idea and one which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may well have positive effects in some cases, although it would cause real complications</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and difficulties in others: would, say, the family of Sir Winston Churchill be able to sue if a</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">published book was defamatory of him? Furthermore, it is a change that would not address</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the wider problems of the harassment by journalists and photographers of those grieving the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">loss of loved ones, and truthful but insensitive reporting in the aftermath of death or tragedy.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">To address those wider issues, it is not a change in the law but a change in culture that is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">required, to ensure that those who are responsible for reporting, photographing, and editing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories of death and tragedy treat those who may be grieving or in shock with the dignity they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deserve. It is clearly not impossible to do so because so many, much of the time, do so. It is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">difficult, therefore, to see why it should not be the practice of all.</span>

<h2>7. Treatment of children</h2>

<p id="para-id-7-1"><a href="#para7-1" name="para7-1">7.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A further criticism made by some Core Participants to the Inquiry was the failure of parts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press to treat children with dignity and respect. As noted in the evidence of Stephen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Abell, then Director of the PCC, the Editors&#8217; Code imposes tight restrictions to safeguard</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the interests of children, and its terms are interpreted broadly to provide a high level of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protection to children. Although a public interest exception may allow for the publication of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private information about children, the public interest justification must be &#8220;exceptional&#8221; to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">outweigh the &#8220;paramount interests&#8221; of children.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref346" href="#footnote346">346</a></sup> No-one who gave evidence to the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggested that the Code was in any way defective in providing this higher level of protection</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In her evidence, Ms Church revealed a disrespect from photographers, journalists and editors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for her own privacy when a child, and subsequently a disregard for her children&#8217;s privacy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">once she was a mother. As noted above, Ms Church told the Inquiry that, after the birth of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her daughter, when six paparazzi were waiting outside her house for a photograph of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">baby, she chose to sell managed photographs to OK! Magazine rather than face the pack</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of photographers: the idea was to allow the photographs to be taken in the hope that she</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would then be left alone. Rosie Nixon, the editor of Hello! Magazine, told the Inquiry of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressure experienced by new mothers in Ms Church&#8217;s position, as there was a<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;sort</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> bounty</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the head of that child for the first photos. They can make a paparazzo a lot of money&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref347" href="#footnote347">347</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The harassment experienced by Ms Church after the birth of her child was shared by Ms Hong</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">after giving birth to Mr Grant&#8217;s child,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref348" href="#footnote348">348</a></sup> and by Ms Rowling after the birth of her children.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref349" href="#footnote349">349</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-3"><a href="#para7-3" name="para7-3">7.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry was told that the demand for photographs and information about the children of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those in the public eye continued well beyond the early days of the childrens&#8217; lives. Mr Coogan</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">spoke of the publication, without consent, of a photograph of his seven year old and five year</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">oldchildren.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref350" href="#footnote350">350</a></sup> InadditiontothemanyexamplesgivenbyMsRowlingofphotographersseeking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to take (and newspaper titles publishing) photographs of her children without consent, she</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">told the Inquiry of a journalist placing a note in her five year old daughter&#8217;s schoolbag,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref351" href="#footnote351">351</a></sup> and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">another journalist contacting the headmaster at her 15 year old daughter&#8217;s school to discuss</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private (and fabricated) information about her daughter.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref352" href="#footnote352">352</a></sup> The intolerable levels of press and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">paparazzi harassment experienced by the McCanns on their return to Portugal was suffered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not only by Drs Kate and Gerry McCann, but also by their two and a half year old twins who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were with them throughout and who found the experience very upsetting. Photographs of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the twins were published in numerous newspapers, without pixellation, and without any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear justification except for the fact that the story was &#8220;unique&#8221; and &#8220;intense&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref353" href="#footnote353">353</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-4"><a href="#para7-4" name="para7-4">7.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A further, high profile example of this failure was the decision of The Sun newspaper, in 2006,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to publish private medical information about the son of the then Chancellor of the Exchequer,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Mr Brown, discussed above.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref354" href="#footnote354">354</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-5"><a href="#para7-5" name="para7-5">7.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">All of these examples suggested that parts of the press failed to abide by the Editors&#8217; Code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generally, but specifically failed to abide by the requirement not to use the fame or notoriety</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a parent as sole justification for publishing private details of a child.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-6"><a href="#para7-6" name="para7-6">7.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When considering the evidence in the round, it is fair to say that the press tends to be more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">respectful of the privacy of children than that of adults: there were substantially fewer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints heard by the Inquiry in relation to children than in relation to adults, and even</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Browns noted that, since The Sun&#8217;s publication of medical information about their child,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press has generally refrained from publishing photographs of, or information about,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their children. However, the fact that unethical press practices in relation to children are less</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">frequent, or limited to a smaller section of the press, does not mean that there is less urgency</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggests that the Editors&#8217; Code continues to be breached in relation to children. The reason</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the Editors&#8217; Code is obvious: to those whose children have been unjustifiably exposed to</span>

<h2>8. Representation of women and minorities</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p id="para-id-8-1"><a href="#para8-1" name="para8-1">8.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">A different kind of criticism made by those who submitted evidence to the Inquiry was that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the representation of women and minorities (such as immigrants or asylum seekers), at least</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in parts of the press, is discriminatory and ill-considered. What makes these complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different from those which precede them is that they are complaints on behalf of classes of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">people, rather than a series of individuals. Under the complaints system operated by the PCC,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which normally requires an individual complainant who was individually affected by a story,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this kind of complaint was not ordinarily admissible.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref356" href="#footnote356">356</a></sup> Accordingly, the Inquiry provided</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a first opportunity for a number of representative groups to express their concerns about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discriminatory press reporting.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-2"><a href="#para8-2" name="para8-2">8.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The starting point for an accurate examination of this topic is the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the relevant provisions of which specify as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref357" href="#footnote357">357</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;It is essential that an agreed code should be honoured not only to the letter but in the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">full spirit. It should not be interpreted so narrowly as to compromise its commitment</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to respect for the rights of the individual, nor so broadly that it constitutes an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">unnecessary interference with freedom of expression or prevents publication in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public interest.</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">12. Discrimination</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(i) The press must avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference to an individual&#8217;s race,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or to any form of physical or mental</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">illness or disability.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(ii) Details of an individual&#8217;s race, colour, religion, sexual orientation, physical or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mental illness or disability must be avoided unless genuinely relevant to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">story.&#8217;</span>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref356" name="footnote356" title="Go back to footnote reference 356 in the text">356</a>.  However, the evidence suggested that exceptions were made to allow representative complaints in certainundefined circumstances: see, for example, the evidence of Stephen Abell at pp109-111, lines 17-15, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-30-January-2012.pdf</p><!--footnote-->

 <p id="para-id-8-3"><a href="#para8-3" name="para8-3">8.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the context of this section of the Report, in theory, it is possible to envisage three types</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of complaint to the PCC arising out of these provisions. First, a complaint brought by an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual of inaccurate, discriminatory and/or pejorative reporting directly relating to him or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her. The vast majority of complaints of discrimination do not fall within this category. Second,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a complaint brought by a group relating to an individual directly identified in the offending</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">article, where that individual does not wish to bring his or her own complaint. Here, no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue arises on the Code as such, because the case clearly falls within the language of clause</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">12; the issue is the PCC&#8217;s policy. Third, a complaint brought by a group, relating to alleged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discriminatory treatment of the group as a whole, rather than any one individual. This type</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of complaint does raise an issue on the terminology of the Code because clause 12 refers in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terms to an individual&#8217;s personal characteristics, not to those of a group. Put simply, the Code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would clearly be breached if an article attacked Mr Y on the basis that he was a member</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a particular religious group, but it is far less clear that the same breach would occur if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there were no mention, either express or implied, of Mr Y in the article and the attack were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">directed at the religious group in general.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-4"><a href="#para8-4" name="para8-4">8.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A reading of the Code which takes on board its spirit rather than simply the letter probably</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does not surmount this difficulty. The only route to finding a violation of the Code in such a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case would be by invoking clause 1, the requirement to be accurate. Some discriminatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reporting is too subjective and loosely worded to fall foul of this provision, but it is not too</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">difficult to envisage examples of reporting which would engage it.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-5"><a href="#para8-5" name="para8-5">8.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Those representing women&#8217;s and minority groups would be entitled to retort that if the Code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as currently worded creates the kind of legalistic difficulties which have just been outlined,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then the solution is a straightforward one: simply amend the Code. The force of this point</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">is noted, but it should be considered in depth by any future regulator, rather than by this</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Inquiry.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-6"><a href="#para8-6" name="para8-6">8.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Theargumenthasalsobeenputthatthereisanimportantissueoffreespeechinplayhere,and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the press is entitled to be partisan. Furthermore, matters of taste and decency are outside</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Code, and properly should be. The force of these arguments needs to be recognised, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only in their proper context. For example, putting to one side issues concerned with domestic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">violence, material which is pornographic and demeaning to women does not violate clauses 1</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and 12 of the Code, and is readily available in pornographic magazines subject to the general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">law. This material is offensive to many, but an issue does arise for consideration as to whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a regulator of a free press which is entitled to be tasteless and indecent should be intervening</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in this sort of area.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-7"><a href="#para8-7" name="para8-7">8.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the other hand, most people would argue that obviously racially offensive material,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which on one level might be said to be partisan in tone and content and therefore defensible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as falling within the prerogative of a free press, should be capable of being the subject of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory comment notwithstanding the absence of an obvious first party complainant. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mustberecognised, however,thattherearemanycasesalong thespectrumwherereasonable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">people will disagree.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-8"><a href="#para8-8" name="para8-8">8.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At the very least, the issue is both complex and sensitive. The Inquiry heard from a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of groups who advanced powerful arguments in favour of greater regulation, in particular</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for greater balance. Although the Inquiry received much evidence and submission devoted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the issue of the value of a free press in general terms, few came forward to advance the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contrary case to that put forward by the groups I have mentioned. Sunday Sport (2011) Ltd</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has recently filed a series of well-argued and sustained submissions emphasising the free</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">speech issues and drawing attention to the fact that, in its view, the Inquiry has not received</span>
 <span style="font-size: 15px;">a representative spread of the available factual and opinion evidence. Dominic Mohan, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editor of The Sun, made a spirited defence of Page 3. He is not to be criticised for doing so,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and many will feel that Page 3 of The Sun raises a taste and decency issue and none other.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The point I am seeking to make at this stage is that I am alive to all the arguments and to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fact that, on what might be called the central ground, there is room for reasonable, opposing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">points of view.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">These recommendations would allow for consistency in media regulation when it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">comes to keeping harmful materials out of the mainstream and away from children.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-12"><a href="#para8-12" name="para8-12">8.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is hard to argue against that in respect of some of the material contained in the Sport at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">least, but the regulation of the sale of explicit print material does not fall directly within the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scope of this Inquiry. Of greater potential concern to the Inquiry is the degree to which the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">images may reflect a wider cultural failure to treat women with dignity and respect and/or a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice which, intentionally or not, has the effect of demeaning and degrading women.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-13"><a href="#para8-13" name="para8-13">8.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In respect of Page 3 imagery, there are a range of arguments. There are those, like Object</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the recently formed internet group &#8220;No More Page 3&#8221;, who argue that the persistent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">representation of topless young women on the pages of national newspapers is inherently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">degrading and demeaning. By contrast, there are those like Mr Mohan, who argue that Page</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">3 is &#8220;neither harmful nor offensive&#8221;, and satisfies the demands of a readership.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref365" href="#footnote365">365</a></sup> Somewhere</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in between are those who argue that Page 3 is simply an anomaly: out of place in the 21<span style="font-size: 9px;"> st</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">century where a woman is just as likely as a man to purchase (or edit) a tabloid newspaper,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or lead the country.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-14"><a href="#para8-14" name="para8-14">8.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The arguments between those who adopt each viewpoint will continue. But for the purposes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of this Inquiry, the interesting point is that it was not Page 3<span style="font-style:italic"> per</span><span style="font-style:italic"> se</span> which gave rise to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">core complaints made by women&#8217;s groups. Instead, it was a general attitude which was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">found throughout the pages of those tabloids which contained images of semi-naked women</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(referred to as &#8216;Page 3 tabloids&#8217;), and of which Page 3 was only one example. Object, along</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">with other organisations such as Turn Your Back on Page 3, Eaves Housing for Women, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the End Violence Against Women Coalition argued that Page 3 imagery was part of a broader</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">culture of objectification and sexualisation of women in those newspapers. Ms Van Heeswijk</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">wrote:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;This pervasive objectification and sexualisation of women is not restricted to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">portrayal of the Page 3 models or to the Page 3 type feature. Rather, to varying</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">extents, it influences the way that almost all women are portrayed in Page 3 tabloids,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">including female celebrities. Examples include an article in the Daily Star on the size</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of &#8220;15 year old&#8221; Charlotte Church&#8217;s breasts (&#8220;She&#8217;s a big girl now&#8230; Child singing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sensation showed just how quickly she&#8217;s grown up after turning up at a Hollywood</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bash looking chest swell&#8221;). This is juxtaposed with commentary of outrage against</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">the satirical &#8220;sting&#8221; Brass Eye documentary&#8217;s &#8220;Paedophile special&#8221; (Exhibit 4). More</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recent examples include a feature in the Sport commenting on the genitalia of a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">female newsreader which it describes in derogatory terms. (Exhibit 5)&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref366" href="#footnote366">366</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-15"><a href="#para8-15" name="para8-15">8.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both of the examples given in that passage support the broader points made by Ms Van</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Heeswijk and others. First, the unfortunate juxtaposition of the article expressing outrage at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a satirical programme on paedophilia and an article commenting on a 15 year-old&#8217;s breasts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exposes a hypocrisy in relation to the sexualisation of young girls and women that is seen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">beyond the Page 3 tabloids: some have commented on the awkward co-existence of the Daily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mail&#8217;s support for &#8220;traditional values&#8221; with the Mail Online&#8217;s &#8220;sidebar of shame&#8221;. Second, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">article commenting on the genitalia of a female newsreader supports the view that some</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">Page 3 tabloids apply a demeaning and sexualising lens beyond those who choose to appear</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Object&#8217;s submission to the Inquiry gave examples of the sexualisation or demeaning of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">women from articles in The Sun, the Daily Star, and the Sport over a single week in November</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2011. The articles exhibited demonstrated the<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;gradient</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> extremity&#8221;</span> from The Sun through</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">objectifying material.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref367" href="#footnote367">367</a></sup> All three included numerous articles with no other purpose except</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">appeared to eroticise violence against women.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-17"><a href="#para8-17" name="para8-17">8.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This final category of article was forcefully criticised by the End Violence Against Women</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Coalition and Eaves Housing who both argued that there was a tendency in parts of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to trivialise and/or sexualise violence against women.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref368" href="#footnote368">368</a></sup> One of the examples identified from</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">underwear.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref369" href="#footnote369">369</a></sup> A similar example from the Sport was an article, adjacent to a photograph of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">large breasted, topless model, about a man who had committed a sexual offence by groping</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">a woman&#8217;s breasts.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref370" href="#footnote370">370</a></sup> A further example from the Sport involved a comment piece expressing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the writer&#8217;s desire to have sex with a celebrity, but joking that the only way that would happen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was if he raped her.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref371" href="#footnote371">371</a></sup> Many more examples were made available to the Inquiry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref372" href="#footnote372">372</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-18"><a href="#para8-18" name="para8-18">8.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence as a whole suggested that there is force in the trenchant views expressed by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the groups and organisations who testified to the Inquiry that the Page 3 tabloid press often</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">failed to show consistent respect for the dignity and equality of women generally, and that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was a tendency to sexualise and demean women. That failure is particularly clear in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pages of the Sport, which is, in my view, hardly distinguishable from the admittedly &#8216;softer&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">end of top-shelf pornography. But it exists to a lesser degree in the Daily Star and The Sun.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For The Sun, at least, it is a failure of consistency, rather than a general failure to show respect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for women. The Sun has campaigned admirably against domestic violence, rape, and size zero</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">models.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref373" href="#footnote373">373</a></sup> But it is clear that those campaigns have, perhaps uncomfortably, sat alongside</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">demeaning and sexualising representations of women.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Importantly, these criticisms of the Page 3 tabloids do not derive from the fact those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers contain an image of a topless woman on Page 3 (or not only from that fact).</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">They are criticisms for which evidence can be found on a reading of all the pages in those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers as a whole . They are also supported by the response that the tabloids have made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to those who have criticised Page 3.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-20"><a href="#para8-20" name="para8-20">8.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When Clare Short MP campaigned against Page 3 in the 1980s she was described by The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sun as &#8220;fat&#8221;, &#8220;ugly&#8221; and &#8220;jealous of beautiful women&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref374" href="#footnote374">374</a></sup> When the Rt Hon Harriet Harman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposed legislation to ban Page 3 in 2010, she was described as a &#8220;harridan&#8221; and a &#8220;feminist</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fanatic&#8221; on a &#8220;furious rant&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref375" href="#footnote375">375</a></sup> Similarly, when ex-Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MP raised the issue in Government, she was described as a &#8220;battleaxe&#8221; and her proposal to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">limit children&#8217;s ability to purchase newspapers containing topless women was described as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;potty plan&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref376" href="#footnote376">376</a></sup> Describing the female critics of Page 3 as fat, ugly, jealous, feminist fanatics,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thus far, these criticisms have been considered at a level of some abstraction; it remains</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">majority of the material discussed under this sub-heading probably does not. The impact of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discriminatory or prejudicial representations of women in the Page 3 tabloids is difficult to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">judge. There is credible evidence that it has a broader impact on the perception and role of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">women in society, and the sexualisation of society generally,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref377" href="#footnote377">377</a></sup> although submissions from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sunday Sport (2011) Ltd refer to the range of academic opinion on the issue. Suffice to say,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this Inquiry is not the place to analyse, let alone reach conclusions on these matters.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-22"><a href="#para8-22" name="para8-22">8.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That said, these are important and sensitive issues which merit further consideration by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any new regulator. What is clearly required is that any such regulator has the power to take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints from representative women&#8217;s groups. Consideration should also be given to Code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">amendments which, while protecting freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">equip that body with the power to intervene in cases of allegedly discriminatory reporting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and in so doing reflect the spirit of equalities legislation.</span>

<h3>Representation of minorities</h3>

<p id="para-id-8-23"><a href="#para8-23" name="para8-23">8.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry received a range of submissions from minority groups, as well as individuals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">raising similar points on behalf of groups; the full range of these submissions is available on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry website. Of necessity, the summary below draws on a selection of the submissions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that were received, but the points will be equally relevant to many of the others who wrote in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, indeed, many other groups who did not take the opportunity to do so.</span>

 <h4>Transgender</h4>

<p id="para-id-8-24"><a href="#para8-24" name="para8-24">8.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Trans Media Watch (TMW) provided evidence to the Inquiry of disturbing and intrusive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reporting of transgender and intersex issues by parts of the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref378" href="#footnote378">378</a></sup> They wrote:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref379" href="#footnote379">379</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The media &#8211; and the tabloid press in particular &#8211; has played a powerful role in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">creating and sustaining a climate of prejudice against transgender people. Worse&#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">instances in which the tabloid press has created situations in which very vulnerable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people (including transgender children) are &#8220;monstered&#8221; and face public abuse or the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">threat of violence are not hard to find. Nor is it difficult to discover stories in which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">transgender people have had their privacy shamelessly invaded, personal details that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could place them in grave danger revealed (either unethically or even illegally), or lies</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">circulated about them by the press. Entirely innocent individuals have been forced</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">out of jobs and homes, even received death threats, on the basis of coverage in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">British press.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Whilst an occasionally more sympathetic piece might appear, in a &#8220;human interest&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">setting, the tabloid press (especially) has consistently expressed almost no interest in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">behaving with human decency towards transgender people.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Theorganisationsaidthatthetabloidpressinparticulartendedtofitstoriesabouttransgender</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues within one of three categories: &#8220;trans as fraud&#8221;, &#8220;trans as undeserving&#8221; and &#8220;trans as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deviant and deserving of parody&#8221;. To that list might be added &#8220;the outing of transgender</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">people&#8221;. TMW provided to the Inquiry many examples of these kinds of stories. Within this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">report it is possible to refer to only a few, but the examples which follow are by no means</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">aberrations.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-26"><a href="#para8-26" name="para8-26">8.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Within the categories &#8220;trans as fraud&#8221; and &#8220;trans as undeserving&#8221; was an article published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the Daily Express and titled<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;Half</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Man</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Gets</span><span style="font-style:italic"> New</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Breasts</span><span style="font-style:italic"> (and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> guess</span><span style="font-style:italic"> who&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> paying</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#163;78k)&#8217;</span> .</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">TMW said the article was not only inaccurate (the cost of gender reconstruction surgery is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nowhere near as high as &#163;78k), but it was also part of a narrative adopted by much of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">tabloid press presenting transgender people as undeserving frauds using public money for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">illegitimate means.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref380" href="#footnote380">380</a></sup> An article with a similar theme was exhibited from The Sun entitled</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Within the category &#8220;trans as deviant and deserving of parody&#8221;, TMW highlighted The Sun&#8217;s</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">tabloid press to use comedic, demeaning or ridiculing language in stories about transgender</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">people. Examples were The Sun&#8217;s use of genital-based puns in the headlines<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;Dad</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> two</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">TMW noted its tendency to report on transgender people as though the category were false</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or unreal: it frequently used inverted commas around the words &#8216;transgender people&#8217;, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">referred to transgender women as &#8220;men&#8221; and transgender men as &#8220;women&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref385" href="#footnote385">385</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The final category &#8211; the outing of transgender people &#8211; was perhaps the most disturbing,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given the very damaging effect this can have on individuals. Helen Belcher of TMW told the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry that The Sun&#8217;s<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;Dad</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> two</span><span style="font-style:italic"> driver</span><span style="font-style:italic"> changes</span><span style="font-style:italic"> gear</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> sex</span><span style="font-style:italic"> swap&#8217;</span> story was written without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">permission and without reference to the subject of the story. The photograph was similarly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">published without permission. Ms Belcher said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref386" href="#footnote386">386</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The piece was rewritten so it looked as though the subject had colluded with the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Sun. The first the subject knew was when the Sun published it. It caused her immense</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">distress. It also caused her children huge distress, because they thought that she had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sold her story or was behind her story in some way, and she had nothing to do with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the story whatsoever. It is a pure expose. There is no public interest.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-29"><a href="#para8-29" name="para8-29">8.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Two further examples were referred to in TMW&#8217;s second submission. First, on 12 February</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2012, The Sun had revealed the story of (allegedly) the UK&#8217;s first transgender male to give</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">birth.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref387" href="#footnote387">387</a></sup> Faced with an unwillingness (or inability) of transgender groups to identify the man,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Sun chose to publish a call for the public to identify the person concerned and offered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a reward for information. Eventually, once identified, the individual was door-stepped by a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalist.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref388" href="#footnote388">388</a></sup> The Sun published stories revealing his identity, and other newspapers, including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Daily Mail, published comment pieces about the &#8220;freakish&#8221; and &#8220;revolting&#8221; thought of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">man giving birth.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref389" href="#footnote389">389</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-30"><a href="#para8-30" name="para8-30">8.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, on 20 February 2012, the Daily Mail published a story about a five year old child</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who had been diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder. There was perhaps a public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the story itself, but included within the story was also the child&#8217;s name, date and place</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of birth, birth certificate, photographs of the child and the name of the school and hospital</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">she attended.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref390" href="#footnote390">390</a></sup> It was unclear what form of consent was received to publish the story, but it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seems inconceivable that the child&#8217;s parents would have granted consent for what followed.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In several follow-up articles, the Daily Mail criticised the child&#8217;s &#8220;misguided&#8221; parents for their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;nonsense&#8221; in allowing the child to be diagnosed with a disorder, criticised the school for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">profligate spending of resources to provide a gender neutral toilet in the child&#8217;s school, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">used the child&#8217;s case (and photographs) as an example to debunk the politically correct rise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of an &#8220;industry&#8221; which encourages trans-sexualism.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref391" href="#footnote391">391</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-31"><a href="#para8-31" name="para8-31">8.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The critical comments made in the follow-up pieces, although on occasion uninformed and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potentially misleading, might well have been justified as fair comment on a matter of public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest. However, in the context, they were comment pieces which were directly related</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to an identified, photographed and vulnerable child. Each piece republished the same large</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographs of the five year old as part of the article, and the impact of the reporting as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whole may well have been tremendously damaging. As TMW noted:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref392" href="#footnote392">392</a></sup></span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;TMW recognises that many more children report gender variant episodes than turn</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">out to be trans. However, when a child expresses a strong level of distress about their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">gender, severe psychological issues can result if left untreated. It is entirely possible</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that may decide as she grows older that she wishes to revert to being a boy. If that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">scenario does arise, the level of press exposure is likely to make that decision far</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">harder to take. There is significant concern about giving someone like this so much</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">exposure, especially when they are vulnerable. Paradoxically this is a concern that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press has also expressed, but their rush to publish seems to be paramount.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-32"><a href="#para8-32" name="para8-32">8.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the basis of the evidence seen by the Inquiry, it is clear that there is a marked tendency in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a section of the press to fail to treat members of the transgender and intersex communities</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with sufficient dignity and respect; and in instances where individuals are identified either</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expressly or by necessary implication perpetrate breaches of clause 12 of the Code. Parts of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the tabloid press continue to seek to &#8216;out&#8217; transgender people notwithstanding its prohibition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the Editors&#8217; Code. And parts of the tabloid press continue to refer to the transgender</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">community in derogatory terms, holding transgender people up for ridicule, or denying the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legitimacy of their condition. Although the Inquiry heard evidence that parts of the tabloid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press had &#8220;raised [its] game in terms of transgender reporting&#8221;,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref393" href="#footnote393">393</a></sup> the examples provided by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">TMW of stories from the last year demonstrate that the game needs to be raised significantly</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">higher.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-33"><a href="#para8-33" name="para8-33">8.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The press has shown itself quite capable of doing so: 30 years ago, an Inquiry into the culture</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and ethics of the press was likely to have seen a deluge of complaints relating to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">representation of homosexuals in the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref394" href="#footnote394">394</a></sup> The fact that only a very few such complaints</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">were received by this Inquiry may reflect the press&#8217;s ability to put its own house in order.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Alternatively, it may simply reflect that society had changed and the press has been forced</span>

<h4>Ethnic minorities, immigrants and asylum seekers</h4>

<p id="para-id-8-34"><a href="#para8-34" name="para8-34">8.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It seems that a raising of the game is also required in relation to the representation of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some ethnic minorities, immigrants and asylum seekers. The Joint Council for the Welfare</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Immigrants drew the Inquiry&#8217;s attention to a recent report from the Council of Europe&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commission on Racism and Intolerance, which stated:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref395" href="#footnote395">395</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Travellers are regularly presented in a negative light in the mainstream media, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in particular the tabloid press, where they are frequently portrayed, for example, as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">being by definition associated with terrorism, sponging off British society, making</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bogus claims for protection or being troublemakers. ECRI is concerned... [about] the</span>

<p id="para-id-8-35"><a href="#para8-35" name="para8-35">8.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This conclusion, and in particular, the identification of Muslims, migrants, asylum seekers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and gypsies/travellers as the targets of press hostility and/or xenophobia in the press, was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">supported by the evidence seen by the Inquiry.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In relation to alleged discrimination of Muslims, the Muslim advocacy group ENGAGE shared</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its concern that the last decade had seen, within parts of the tabloid press, an increase in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Islamophobic and discriminatory coverage of Muslim issues. It drew the Inquiry&#8217;s attention</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to numerous headlines referring to Muslims, or Muslim practices, in alarmist and sensational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terms. It noted, amongst others, the following headlines, which appeared to have little factual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">basis but which may have contributed to a negative perception of Muslims in the UK:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;Muslim</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">posting on the ummah.com website. Investigations revealed that the posting had</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">ENGAGE&#8217;s representative, Inayat Bunglawala, was of the view that the articles complained of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had the cumulative effect of increasing prejudice against Muslims. However, he went further:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his view was that the headlines identified, and the decisions to place those articles on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">front page of the newspapers, were deliberate, and were intended deliberately to increase</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such prejudice.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref403" href="#footnote403">403</a></sup> He indicated that many of the headlines had been used by the far right to</span>

<p id="para-id-8-40"><a href="#para8-40" name="para8-40">8.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Daily Telegraph&#8217;s Peter Oborne shared some of these concerns. His pamphlet<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;Muslims</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Under Siege&#8217;<span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> instructive.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref405" href="#footnote405">405</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> It</span><span style="font-style:normal"> recalled</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span><span style="font-style:normal"> story</span><span style="font-style:normal"> published</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> The</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Sun</span><span style="font-style:normal"> with</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> headline</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">that millions of Sun readers reading the article would have felt justified anger and contempt</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Muslim involvement of any kind.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> The</span><span style="font-style:normal"> pamphlet</span><span style="font-style:normal"> continued:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref406" href="#footnote406">406</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;What the Sun had done was to take a local story about a piece of vandalism,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">probably caused by local snobbery about the presence of soldiers &#8211; and convert it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">into another kind of story altogether about evil Muslims. This case is far from unique.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">As we discovered while researching this pamphlet, is in fact typical of reporting of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Muslim communities across large parts of the mainstream British media.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more subtle set of implicitly negative representations, with Muslims often being</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;collectivised&#8221; via homogenising terms like &#8220;Muslim world&#8221; and written about</span>

<p id="para-id-8-42"><a href="#para8-42" name="para8-42">8.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Other academic research seen by the Inquiry supports that view. In its briefing note for the All</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In sum, we found that the bulk of coverage of British Muslims &#8211; around two thirds</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; focuses on Muslims as a threat (in relation to terrorism), a problem (in terms of</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The language used about British Muslims reflects the negative or problematic</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contexts in which they tend to appear. Four of the five most common discourses used</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about Muslims in the British press associate Islam/Muslims with threats, problems</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or in opposition to dominant British values. So, for example, the idea that Islam is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">dangerous, backward or irrational is present in 26% of stories. By contrast, only 2%</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of stories contained the proposition that Muslims supported dominant moral values.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Similarly, we found that the most common nouns used in relation to British Muslims</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were terrorist, extremist, Islamist, suicide bomber and militant, with very few positive</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nouns (such as &#8216;scholar&#8217;) used. The most common adjectives used were radical,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fanatical, fundamentalist, extremist and militant. Indeed, references to radical</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Muslims outnumber references to moderate Muslims by 17 to one.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Peppiatt suggested that this type of unbalanced reporting was motivated by circulation.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One of the keys reasons he cited for resigning from the Daily Star was what he perceived</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as its Islamophobic agenda. He said that he experienced a top down pressure to unearth</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories which fit within what was described as the Daily Star&#8217;s &#8220;narrative&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;immigrants</span><span style="font-style:italic"> are</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Muslim only public loos&#8221; story. Although the newspaper was aware that the story was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">true, an editorial decision was taken to publish anyway. Similarly, Mr Peppiatt described an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">article he wrote on plans to require Sikhs to remove their turbans at airport security, for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fear that Islamic terrorists might disguise themselves as Sikhs. There was no factual basis for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that story either, but Mr Peppiatt invented quotes from a &#8220;security source&#8221; to lend an air of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Theoverallpictureismorenuanced thanwitnessessuchasMrPeppiatthavebeenpreparedto</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accept. The Daily Star submitted a lever arch file containing a bundle of what it described were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;pro-Muslim&#8217; articles; although I would not necessarily agree with that precise designation,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the broad sentiment is wholly accurate. Here, a quantitative assessment is inappropriate;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry could not begin to reach judgments as to the proportion of &#8216;pro-Muslim&#8217; against</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">&#8216;anti-Muslim&#8217; pieces.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-45"><a href="#para8-45" name="para8-45">8.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In any event, that would be to miss the point. It is not as if the &#8216;pro&#8217; articles somehow cancel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out or fall to be weighed in the balance against the &#8216;anti&#8217;: the real point is whether articles</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unfairly representing Muslims in a negative light are appropriate in a mature democracy which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">respects both freedom of expression and the right of individuals not to face discrimination.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence demonstrates that sections of the press betray a tendency, which is far from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being universal or even preponderant, to portray Muslims in a negative light. As with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the case of discrimination against women discussed above, issues arise in relation to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interpretation and application of clause 12 of the Editors&#8217; Code, and the arguable need to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identify an individual target of discrimination, but the key point which falls to be made in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">present context is the need for a regulator with the ability and power to grapple with these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues and set appropriate standards.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-46"><a href="#para8-46" name="para8-46">8.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The tendency identified in the preceding paragraph is not limited to the representation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Muslims and applies in a similar way to some other minority ethnic groups. The Joint</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council on the Welfare of Immigrants, the Migrant and Refugee Communities Forum, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Federation of Poles in Great Britain gave evidence that supported and complemented</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">each other. Together, their evidence suggested that the approach of parts of the press to</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">migrants and asylum seekers was one of advocacy rather than reporting: some newspapers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expressed a consistently clear view on the harm caused by migrants and/or asylum seekers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(often conflating the two) and ensured that any coverage of the issue fit within that narrative.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-47"><a href="#para8-47" name="para8-47">8.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is unquestionably right that, in relation to inherently political questions like immigration</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and asylum, editors and journalists are entitled to express their strongly held views in their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers. However, the concerns raised by the various witnesses were not limited to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expression of views, but included allegations of wilful blindness to the (lack of) truth of stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which fit with a newspaper&#8217;s adopted viewpoint. Stories which are factually incorrect clearly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">raise issues under clause 1 of the Code regardless of clause 12. The organisations drew the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry&#8217;s attention to the follow as examples:</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">(a) The Sun&#8217;s story headlined &#8220;Swan Bake&#8221;, which alleged that gangs of Eastern European</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">asylum seekers were killing and eating swans from ponds and lakes in London.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Unidentified people were cited as witnesses to the phenomenon, but it seemed there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was no basis to the story: the Sun was unable to defend the article against a PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaint.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref412" href="#footnote412">412</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) The Daily Star&#8217;s article headlined &#8220;Asylum seekers eat our donkeys.&#8221; The story told of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disappearance of nine donkeys from Greenwich Royal Park. The police were reported as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">having no idea what had happened to the donkeys but, in a piece of total speculation,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the story went on to claim that donkey meat was a speciality in Somalia and Eastern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Europe, that there were &#8220;large numbers of Somalian asylum-seekers&#8221; in the area and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some Albanians nearby, and concluded that asylum seekers had eaten the donkeys.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref413" href="#footnote413">413</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) The Daily Mail&#8217;s erroneous report that a judge had allowed an immigrant to remain in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the UK because &#8220;the right to family life&#8221; protected his relationship with his cat.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref414" href="#footnote414">414</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-48"><a href="#para8-48" name="para8-48">8.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is one thing for a newspaper to take the view that immigration should be reduced, or that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the asylum and/or human rights system should be reformed, and to report on true stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which support those political views. It is another thing to misreport stories either wilfully</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or reckless as to their truth or accuracy, in order to ensure that they support those political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">views. And it does appear that certain parts of the press do, on occasion, prioritise the political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stance of the title over the accuracy of the story. Ms Stanistreet, on behalf of the NUJ, gave</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref415" href="#footnote415">415</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Journalists that I spoke to in the course of collating this testimony painted a disturbing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">picture of the nature of the day to day sentiments expressed by senior editorial staff-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">such comments give an insight into the approach taken on coverage of race and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ethnicity. These included a reporter being told by the news editor to &#8220;write a story</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about Britain being flooded by asylum-seeking bummers&#8221;; instructions to &#8220;make</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">stories as right wing as you can&#8221;; a reporter being told to go out and find Muslim</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">women to photograph with the instruction: &#8220;Just fucking do it. Wrap yourself around</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a group of women in burkas for a photo&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-49"><a href="#para8-49" name="para8-49">8.49</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although the weight to be given to this anonymous evidence is necessarily limited, it coheres</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the evidence given by Mr Peppiatt and Mr Oborne, and is consistent with the kinds of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints made by the Joint Council on the Welfare of Immigrants, the Migrant and Refugee</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Communities Forum, the Federation of Poles in Great Britain, ENGAGE and Mr Nagdi. That</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence suggested that, in relation to reporting on Muslims, immigrants and asylum seekers,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was a tendency for some titles to adopt a sensationalist mode of reporting intended to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">support a world-view rather than to report a story. The evidence given by the Irish Traveller</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Movement in Britain suggested a similar approach to gypsy and traveller issues.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref416" href="#footnote416">416</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-50"><a href="#para8-50" name="para8-50">8.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is important to reiterate that the evidence was not all bad: there were many examples of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">titles with responsible and positive reporting on these issues, and even within the section</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press identified for criticism, there was evidence showing a complicated picture. For</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">example, although the Daily Mail has been criticised for its reporting of some minority issues,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its Stephen Lawrence campaign demonstrated a newspaper committed to tackling and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">condemning racism.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-51"><a href="#para8-51" name="para8-51">8.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nonetheless, when assessed as a whole, the evidence of discriminatory, sensational or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unbalanced reporting in relation to ethnic minorities, immigrants and/or asylum seekers, is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerning. The press can have significant influence over community relations and the way in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which parts of society perceive other parts. While newspapers are entitled to express strong</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">views on minority issues, immigration and asylum, it is important that stories on those issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">areaccurate,andarenotcalculatedtoexacerbatecommunitydivisionsorincreaseresentment.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although the majority of the press appear to discharge this responsibility with care, there are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enough examples of careless or reckless reporting to conclude that discriminatory, sensational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or unbalanced reporting in relation to ethnic minorities, immigrants and/or asylum seekers is</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">a feature of journalistic practice in parts of the press, rather than an aberration.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-52"><a href="#para8-52" name="para8-52">8.52</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Overall, the evidence in relation to the representation of women and minorities suggests</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there has been a significant tendency within the press which leads to the publication of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prejudicial or pejorative references to race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or physical or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mental illness or disability. Whether these publications have also amounted to breaches of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Editors&#8217; Code in every case is debatable, but in the ultimate analysis is little to the point.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That failure has, in the main, been limited to a section of the press and may well stem from an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undue focus on seeking to reflect the views (even if unsuccessfully) of a particular readership.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A new regulator will need to address these issues as a matter of priority, the first steps being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to amend practice and the Code to permit third party complaints.</span>

<h2>9. Inaccuracy</h2>

<p id="para-id-9-1"><a href="#para9-1" name="para9-1">9.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not by accident that the Editors&#8217; Code begins with a requirement for accuracy:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref417" href="#footnote417">417</a></sup> it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the foundation stone on which journalism depends. For that reason, the extensive evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">heard by the Inquiry of problems with basic accuracy in parts of the press caused significant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern. In what follows, that evidence is considered in five parts. These are:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) evidence of deliberate invention and fabrication of stories by sections of the press, and/</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or a failure to check the truth of invented stories;</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref416" name="footnote416" title="Go back to footnote reference 416 in the text">416</a>.  http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Submission-from-The-Irish-Traveller-Movement-March-2012.pdf ; http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Submission-from-The-Irish-Traveller-Movement-April-20121.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref417" name="footnote417" title="Go back to footnote reference 417 in the text">417</a>.  Clause 1(i) of the PCC Code requires the press to take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distortedinformation, including pictures.</p><!--footnote-->
 <span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) evidence of deliberately misleading headlines;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) evidence of careless or reckless inaccuracy in particular when reporting fast moving</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and high profile stories;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) evidence of a tendency for sections of the press to report political and social issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inaccurately in order to fit into the worldview of the title; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) evidence that scientific stories are reported poorly and often inaccurately by much of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-2"><a href="#para9-2" name="para9-2">9.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is important to note that it is inevitable that inaccuracies will appear in newspapers,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given the quantity of stories published and the speed at which they need to be written. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is also inevitable that some stories will be defamatory. But what is not inevitable is that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inaccuracies or defamations will be deliberate or the result of reckless or careless journalism.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry heard many examples of inaccuracies in the press, and sometimes damaging</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inaccuracies which had led to successful defamation claims and serious criticism of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers involved.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref418" href="#footnote418">418</a></sup> Although consideration was given to basing criticisms in this Report</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">upon some of those examples, I decided that it would be unjustified to do so. Unless the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examples of inaccuracy manifestly fell into the categories of deliberate, reckless or careless</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inaccuracy, they have not been included in what follows.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-3"><a href="#para9-3" name="para9-3">9.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has been told by a number of witnesses that the majority of inaccuracy complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the PCC emanate from the regional press. As has been explained elsewhere, that section</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press has been expressly excluded from the generic criticisms which form this lengthy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chapter of the Report. But there is no inconsistency here: the point has already been made</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">that mistakes are inevitable in any industry which depends on the judgments of human beings,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the problems deriving from the regional press are not in my view cultural or systemic. No</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one has suggested to the Inquiry that they are &#8211; indeed, many have suggested affirmatively</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that they are not &#8211; and on the available evidence I am happy to endorse that conclusion.</span>

<h3>Fabrication or deliberate embellishment of stories</h3>

<p id="para-id-9-4"><a href="#para9-4" name="para9-4">9.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry heard sufficient evidence to conclude that some sections of the press have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deliberately invented stories with no factual basis in order to satisfy the demands of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">readership. Mr Peppiatt spoke of his experience while a journalist at the Daily Star of a top-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">down pressure to fabricate stories. As noted above, he gave numerous examples of Daily Star</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories about celebrities and about Muslim issues that were published despite the knowledge</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that they were untrue.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref419" href="#footnote419">419</a></sup> In his resignation letter, he had written:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref420" href="#footnote420">420</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Daily Star favourite Kelly Brook recently said in an interview: &#8220;I do Google myself.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Not that often, though, and the stories are always rubbish. &#8220;There was a story that</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In that context, fictional stories were not only relatively commonplace, but were actively</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although Mr Peppiatt&#8217;s evidence was challenged by the Daily Star and a number of witnesses</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">said that they did not recognise what he had described, it was consistent with the anonymous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence reported by Steve Turner of the British Association of Journalists: he had received</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints from a number of other journalists who had reported similar editorial pressure to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fabricate stories, sometimes under threat of dismissal.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref423" href="#footnote423">423</a></sup> The evidence of Sharon Marshall is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consistent with that of Mr Peppiatt. Not only did she suggest that quotations were routinely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made up but also that it was common practice in some of the papers on which she worked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for journalists to fabricate quotations to push a particular line with regard to a story and then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">find a willing contact to &#8216;own&#8217; the quote. She provides the specific example of the model</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and TV presenter, Abi Titmuss, who was one of a number of celebrities called to see if they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would &#8216;own&#8217; a quotation that had been written to push a particular point of view or story.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref424" href="#footnote424">424</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further, a willingness by parts of the press to fabricate in order to tell an &#8216;impactful&#8217; story was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also evidenced by Piers Morgan&#8217;s admission to have altered a photograph digitally to show</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Princess Diana and Dodi al-Fayed kissing, when the original showed nothing of the sort.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref425" href="#footnote425">425</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry heard evidence from a number of witnesses who had been victims of fabricated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories. Mr Grant exhibited an article in the Sunday Express, apparently written by Mr Grant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">himself. In fact, it was entirely fabricated: Mr Grant had not only not written the article, but</span>

<p id="para-id-9-8"><a href="#para9-8" name="para9-8">9.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Campbell complained of numerous fabricated stories about him and about matters in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government generally. In respect of one particular example he said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref428" href="#footnote428">428</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I can recall one weekend being interrupted by persistent calls from reporters</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">following up a story in the Sunday Express that I was leaving Downing Street to take</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">up a position at Manchester United. This was based on so-called quotes from so-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">called friends and colleagues. I called the newspaper &#8211; which had not put the story</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to me in advance &#8211; to complain and to issue a strong denial. I said there was no truth</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">in it whatsoever. &#8220;I know,&#8217; came the response. &#8217;But it&#8217;s a good story.&#8217; &#8230;They knew the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">story was untrue, so did not put it to me because a denial would weaken it&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-9"><a href="#para9-9" name="para9-9">9.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The erroneous report in the Mail Online of the Amanda Knox guilty verdict is a different</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">example.Priortotheverdictbeingreadout,theMailhadpreparedtwo&#8220;setandhold&#8221;versions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a story, to prepare for both a guilty and not guilty verdict; that much is not surprising.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Through human error, the guilty verdict story was published online. That error was also made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by The Sun online and the Guardian online and, again, such error is, at times, unavoidable.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Mail&#8217;s story, however, was unique in that it described, in detail, events that simply did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">happen. Full Fact, an organisation dedicated to monitoring accuracy in the press, explained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref429" href="#footnote429">429</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Amanda Knox was found not guilty of murder. Before that was announced, though,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a verdict of guilty was given in relation to a charge of slander. As soon as the first</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">guilty was pronounced, the Daily Mail published an online article headlined: &#8220;Guilty:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Amanda Knox looks stunned as appeal against murder conviction is rejected.&#8221; The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">first part was mistaken; the second part was fiction.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The fiction continued in the text, including: &#8220;As Knox realized the enormity of what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Judge Hellman was saying she sank into her chair sobbing uncontrollably while her</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">family and friends hugged each other in tears&#8221; and &#8220;Prosecutors were delighted with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the verdict and said that &#8217;justice has been done&#8217; although they said on a &#8217;human</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">factor it was sad two young people would be spending years in jail&#8217;.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-10"><a href="#para9-10" name="para9-10">9.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Mail&#8217;s explanation given by counsel during the course of the Inquiry was that that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story was not fabricated; it claimed to have obtained alternative quotes from the Italian</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecutors in advance to cover guilty or not guilty verdicts. Whether prosecutors provided</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;quotes for publication&#8217; in advance or not, there can be no argument that the description</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of events in the courtroom when the guilty verdict was read out was anything other than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fictitious licence. True it is that the fabrication only added colour and emotion to the story,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but the example raises questions of how widespread that practice is, and how frequently the</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">&#8216;adding of colour&#8217; goes unnoticed.</span>

 <p id="para-id-9-11"><a href="#para9-11" name="para9-11">9.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Campbell, along with Mr Grant and others, expressed their concerns of a growing reliance,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within parts of the press, on anonymous quotes, many of which they believed to be entirely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fabricated.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref430" href="#footnote430">430</a></sup> That there has been regular misuse of attribution to anonymous sources seems</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear in light of the phone hacking revelations. Many of the stories published by the NoTW,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">now known to be based on phone hacking, were attributed to anonymous sources such as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;friends&#8221; or &#8220;pals&#8221; or &#8220;sources&#8221;. Mr Peppiatt confirmed that in his experience, many quotes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attributed to &#8220;a source&#8221;, &#8220;a friend&#8221;, &#8220;a pal&#8221; were indeed invented. He gave examples of quotes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he had invented to support fictional stories about Katie Price, and said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref431" href="#footnote431">431</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Although unnamed sources are a valuable journalistic tool to protect sources, often</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in my experience of tabloids they are simply made up by the reporter to increase the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">word count and add a veneer of legitimacy to something that is speculation, at best.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-12"><a href="#para9-12" name="para9-12">9.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is no easy-fix for this problem. The anonymity of confidential sources is a vital aspect of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalism and must be protected. But the use of anonymous sources can lead to an inability</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to assess whether the source is reliable, or even exists. Solicitor Magnus Boyd raised this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern in relation to a Daily Mail story about one of his clients, the Tamil hunger striker</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Parameswaran Subramanyam. The Mail&#8217;s story alleged that Mr Subramanyam had sustained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">himself with McDonalds hamburgers during his hunger strike and quoted an anonymous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;police insider&#8217; and &#8216;a source&#8217; saying that police surveillance cameras had captured him</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">eating the hamburgers. The story, it transpired, was entirely untrue: there was no police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">surveillance, there was no consumption of hamburgers and the Mail paid substantial damages</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for defamation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref432" href="#footnote432">432</a></sup> In relation to the police sources quoted in the article, Mr Boyd noted:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref433" href="#footnote433">433</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;As a matter of logic there are only two possibilities which are either that:</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">i a police source simply made up these allegations and communicated them to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Daily Mail; or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ii The Daily Mail made up the police sources.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-13"><a href="#para9-13" name="para9-13">9.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">To that, one might add a third possibility, that there was a source, but it was not a &#8216;police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">insider&#8217;, as claimed, and that description of the source was given to lend greater credibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the story. The reality is that it is impossible to know which of those three possibilities is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">correct. The journalist responsible, Stephen Wright, insisted that there was a source for each</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the quotations in the article,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref434" href="#footnote434">434</a></sup> but given the evidence seen by the Inquiry of invented</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sources and fabricated quotations, it is simply a question of having to be prepared to take his</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">word for it.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref435" href="#footnote435">435</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-9-14"><a href="#para9-14" name="para9-14">9.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The very nature of this problem renders it close to impossible to express any generic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusions about it; or, more precisely, conclusions based on evidence as opposed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">informed speculation. There will be many instances where for very good reason a journalist</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">will not wish to reveal the identity of his or her source. Indeed, it is possible to go further:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to do so would break a confidence. But in many other instances, it is inevitable that there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be real concern that the invocation of an anonymous or confidential source is likely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be a camouflage for a source who does not exist, or one who is known or suspected to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unreliable, or one in respect of whom inadequate enquiry is made by the journalist.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-15"><a href="#para9-15" name="para9-15">9.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An informed member of the public may harbour his or her suspicions or concerns about these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matters, but will never know the true position if the journalist does not choose to disclose the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very information which would enable a judgment to be made about it. The very substantial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privileges accorded to journalists in this regard by the European Convention and the common</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">law are such that immense trust is being placed on the press to deploy their sources in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest rather than against it.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-16"><a href="#para9-16" name="para9-16">9.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is a powerful public interest in readers being able to assess for themselves the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence base for any assertion of fact or expression of opinion in a newspaper. Overall,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the identification of the source or sources would go a long way to meeting what Professor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Baroness O&#8217;Neill has described as the public interest in &#8216;assessibility&#8217;; and that should be the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">default position, only to be displaced if the public interest in confidentiality requires it.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-17"><a href="#para9-17" name="para9-17">9.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is likely, of course, that many of the fabricated stories published by parts of the press do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">come from genuine sources, but there is evidence that, in certain circumstances and at certain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">titles, checking the facts provided by a source is limited (if not slapdash) at best. Mr Peppiatt&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view was that some newspapers adopted a cavalier approach to checking facts provided by a</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">source where the risk of litigation was assessed to be low, particularly in celebrity stories that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were not damaging to reputations.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref436" href="#footnote436">436</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-9-18"><a href="#para9-18" name="para9-18">9.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Examples of that approach to celebrity reporting were provided by Mr Atkins, who had sold</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">numerous fictional stories to newspapers during the making of his documentary &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic"> Starsuckers&#8217;</span> .</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The stories, published by various tabloid newspapers despite the fact that the core of each</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story was fabricated, included: Avril Lavigne falling asleep and snoring in a nightclub; Amy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Winehouse setting her hair on fire at a party; Guy Ritchie injuring himself while juggling</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cutlery in a restaurant; Pixie Geldof padding her bra out with sweets; and Sarah Harding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">owning a number of books on quantum physics.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref437" href="#footnote437">437</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-9-19"><a href="#para9-19" name="para9-19">9.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Two aspects of the evidence in relation to the stories stood out. First, two newspapers added</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their own fabrications to the already fabricated stories: in the Amy Winehouse story, the Daily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Star added its own twist that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> friend</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> called</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> ended</span><span style="font-style:italic"> up</span><span style="font-style:italic"> punching</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Flamey</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Amy&#8217;s</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">by The Sun (the Guy Ritchie and Sarah Harding stories) he appeared unwilling to accept that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Sun had, in fact, published fiction. He seemed to suggest that the stories, invented by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Atkins in key respects, might have coincidentally been true. In addition, he seemed not to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">think that there was anything wrong with publishing fiction in a newspaper which purported</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">to be publishing fact. He appeared to suggest that it did not matter because the stories were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;insignificant&#8221; and &#8220;trivial&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref439" href="#footnote439">439</a></sup> Perhaps that explains why the story about Ms Harding remains</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on The Sun&#8217;s website notwithstanding the clear evidence that it was fictional.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref440" href="#footnote440">440</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-9-21"><a href="#para9-21" name="para9-21">9.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is of course correct that the stories were insignificant and were trivial. But that does not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">change the fact that they were fictional, while purporting to be true. Furthermore, although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper readers will accept that not every story they read is accurate (because mistakes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can be made), that is not the same as saying that they would be as sanguine about stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that were known by those responsible for writing and publishing them to have been made up</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or deliberately exaggerated.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-22"><a href="#para9-22" name="para9-22">9.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition to the fact that fictional stories undermine the trust on which newspapers depend,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">part of their problem is that they very quickly become &#8220;popular truth&#8221; by virtue of repetition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in other newspapers, blogs and websites. Ms Church gave an example of this. The People</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">published an entirely fictional story about Ms Church drunkenly proposing marriage to her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">boyfriend while singing karaoke in a pub. Allegedly the story was provided to the People by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a source, but the People chose to rely on that source alone without putting the story directly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Ms Church or her representatives<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref441" href="#footnote441">441</a></sup> and without even the most basic fact checking. In fact,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Church was, at the relevant time, performing in a completely different town with a large</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public audience and there was not even karaoke at the pub she was reported to have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in. Nonetheless, once published, the story was republished and rehashed in more than 70</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">outlets internationally and became &#8220;true&#8221; in the public mind at least.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref442" href="#footnote442">442</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-9-23"><a href="#para9-23" name="para9-23">9.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Peppiatt described how an inaccurate article in one title can spread virally through others.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his experience fact checking was rarely carried out in relation to stories published in</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;reputable&#8221; titles or news agencies. In his written evidence he wrote:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref443" href="#footnote443">443</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The majority of stories appearing in the Daily Star are sourced from the news wires</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or plagiarised from other newspapers, in particular the Daily Mail, which is such a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">heavy influence that for the most part it dictated the Daily Star&#8217;s news agendA. In</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">addition to the major news agencies such as Reuters, PA and Associated Press there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are dozens of local agencies dotted around the country supplying content to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">national press. Some of this content is lifted from local newspapers, or sourced from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">agency reporters&#8217; own contacts&#8230; One obvious consequence of reporters cannibalising</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the work of other journalists is that the former is often wholly unaware of the veracity</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of their information. Sometimes the maxim that a story is &#8220;too good to check&#8221; comes</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">into play, and in this manner falsehoods can easily become propagated across the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">media.&#8221;</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;So as a journalist, you know, if I see a Daily Mail story I&#8217;ve been given to rewrite in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">DailyStarstyle,youknow,formetothenresearchwherethey&#8217;vegottheirinformation,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and if I find out that in fact that information has been distorted or is inaccurate, for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">me to then approach the news desk and say, &#8220;Actually, I&#8217;ve found out this Daily Mail</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">story is just not standing up&#8221;, you&#8217;d be sort of kicked back to your seat fairly robustly.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">You know, that&#8217;s not the point. This is, you know: the Daily Mail said it; write it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-25"><a href="#para9-25" name="para9-25">9.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Again, I recognise that much of what Mr Peppiatt said was challenged and said to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unrecognisable. It is undeniable, however, that many of the allegations that he made have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been exemplified in other evidence provided to the Inquiry.</span>

<h3>Deliberately misleading headlines</h3>

<p id="para-id-9-26"><a href="#para9-26" name="para9-26">9.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A particular problem of inaccuracy identified in the evidence was the use of misleading</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">headlines that misrepresented the content of the actual story. Mr Peppiatt described his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">experience at the Daily Star:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref445" href="#footnote445">445</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Another ethically dubious technique used by the Daily Star (and other tabloids, if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not to the same ridiculous degree) is the overplayed headlines that misrepresent the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">truth of the story beyond. It is such an endemic problem at the Daily Star that most</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">days a comparison of the front page with the story inside is bordering on the comedic.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">One recent example claimed TV KING COWELL IS &#8217;DEAD&#8217;. The story inside was about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">him leaving X Factor. This behaviour is purely a cynical ploy to encourage consumers</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to purchase the Daily Star over rivals. Often lacking a real scoop to encourage this,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they simply pretend to have one. It&#8217;s a con, plain and simple. The Daily Express is no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">better at this. Particularly distasteful are their front page claims of &#8220;miracle cures&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for cancer/Alzheimer&#8217;s/Parkinson&#8217;s, which upon closer analysis are simply initial trials</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on mice, with many years of research ahead before they can even be considered</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">medically sound. This type of misleading sensationalism deliberately plays on offering</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">false hope to people whose lives have been affected by such illnesses, all in order to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sell their papers&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-27"><a href="#para9-27" name="para9-27">9.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition to the<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Telly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> King</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Cowell</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Dead&#8221;</span> story, the Inquiry saw further examples from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Daily Star. One story headed<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Terror</span><span style="font-style:italic"> As</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Plane</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Hits</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Ash</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Cloud&#8221;</span> was accompanied by an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">image of a burning jumbo jet. The story was in fact about a television programme which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had simulated what might happen if a plane flew into a volcanic ash cloud, but the headline</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and picture were so alarming that copies of that edition of the Daily Star were removed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from airports.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref446" href="#footnote446">446</a></sup> Another example was an article headed,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;English</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Defence</span><span style="font-style:italic"> League</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> become</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">quoted as &#8220;not ruling out&#8221; becoming a political party, but expressed a clear preference not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to do so.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref447" href="#footnote447">447</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-9-28"><a href="#para9-28" name="para9-28">9.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Other newspapers were also guilty of misleading headlines. The Daily Express headlined a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">report of a poll showing that 28 per cent of people supported quitting the EU with the headline</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> 75</span><span style="font-style:italic"> per</span><span style="font-style:italic"> cent</span><span style="font-style:italic"> say</span><span style="font-style:italic"> quit</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> EU</span><span style="font-style:italic"> now!&#8221;</span> Similarly, the Mail on Sunday published an article under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the headline<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;BBC</span><span style="font-style:italic"> turns</span><span style="font-style:italic"> its</span><span style="font-style:italic"> back</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Year</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Our</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Lord:</span><span style="font-style:italic"> 2,000</span><span style="font-style:italic"> years</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Christianity</span><span style="font-style:italic"> jettisoned</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Evidence of the embellishment of headlines was not limited to the tabloid press: some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">broadsheets and celebrity magazines were shown to have adopted the practice as well. From</span>

<p id="para-id-9-30"><a href="#para9-30" name="para9-30">9.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In relation to celebrity magazines, the Inquiry was shown a ruling from the PCC in 2008 which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">highlighted the issue and provided the following summary:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref451" href="#footnote451">451</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;Readers Misled by Front Page Teasers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Commission has recently resolved a number of separate complaints from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">concerned readers complaining that magazine covers have promised content that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">does not correspond to the inside articles.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from Melanie Brown, who had briefly referred to Mrs Beckham. In order to resolve</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the complaint, the editor telephoned the complainant, apologising for the confusion</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and offering her a subscription.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Look magazine provoked a complaint about a front-cover image of Jennifer Anniston</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with the caption &#8216;I&#8217;m having a baby!&#8221;. The subsequent article contained the claims that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Ms Aniston was thinking about &#8211; rather than confirmation that she was &#8211; having a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">baby with her partner. The editor apologised to the complainant, undertaking to bear</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">her comments in mind for future reference, and refunded the cost of the magazine.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and Coleen&#8221;. Inside, there was just a full page advertisement for the wedding which was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to be covered in the following week&#8217;s edition. The magazine indicated that it had not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">intended to mislead readers, and offered the complainant a six-month subscription.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">This issue does not only relate to celebrity articles. A problem occurred with Love It</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">magazine, which used the following front-page headline to summarise an article:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Locked up by my hubby and forced to eat&#8221;. The husband complained, making clear</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that his wife was sectioned under the Mental Health Act via a process that was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">controlled by a consultant, a GP and other medical staff. The magazine settled the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">complaint, including by apologising to the complainant.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Clearly, there is growing concern about the use of material on front covers. Magazine</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">editors should be aware of this issue and act to ensure that readers are not misled by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">headline references to inside articles. The Commission may be asked to adjudicate on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the matter, where it would be asked to consider whether the brief reference on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cover is justified by the content of the story itself.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Notwithstanding the fact that the PCC issued this warning in 2008, the Inquiry heard</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence of a continuing problem. In 2010, OK! Magazine advertised an &#8220;exclusive&#8221; interview</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Ms Miller on its website, despite the fact that there was no exclusive interview in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">magazine. Further, during the Inquiry, OK! Magazine published a teaser entitled,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Catherine&#8217;s</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">royal birthday, the intimate party, gifts, star guests and delicious menu&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> despite</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> fact</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inside the magazine there was no information on the gifts, guests or menu at the party.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref452" href="#footnote452">452</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-9-32"><a href="#para9-32" name="para9-32">9.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Itcannotbethecasethatthemajorityofthemisleadingheadlinesandteasersidentifiedduring</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the course of the Inquiry were accidental. Although there was clear evidence (emphasised by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists whose stories were criticised because of the headline) that headline writers were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generally not the journalists who wrote the stories, those sub-editors or headline writers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">must have read the articles or piece in question before composing their headlines. And they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">must have written the headlines in the knowledge, first, that they did not fully reflect the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contents of the article or magazine and, second, that if the rebuttal which undermined the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">headline was included in the piece, it was almost inevitably buried at the end.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-33"><a href="#para9-33" name="para9-33">9.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Daily Star&#8217;s editor Dawn Neesom agreed that the Daily Star&#8217;s headlines were intended</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to create as much impact as possible in order that the person passing the newspaper stand</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might say, &#8220;I&#8217;ll buy the Star today&#8221;. In respect of at least some of the headlines put to her from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the pages of the Star, she accepted that the consequence was that they were misleading.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref453" href="#footnote453">453</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Daily Express editor Hugh Whittow agreed that some of his headlines were designed to strike</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a resonance with the attitudes of his readers, but he too accepted that, in the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> 75</span><span style="font-style:italic"> per</span><span style="font-style:italic"> cent</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lisa Byrne noted a tension between the need to sell the magazine and the need for accuracy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in teasers, but thought that, except in limited examples (a story about Wayne and Coleen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rooney and Sienna Miller example) OK! had not crossed the line into being misleading.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref455" href="#footnote455">455</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-9-34"><a href="#para9-34" name="para9-34">9.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">What seems clear is that, faced with a fiercely competitive market, some titles have found</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">themselves on the wrong side of the line between an attention-grabbing but accurate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">headline and an embellished and inaccurate headline.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref456" href="#footnote456">456</a></sup></span>

<h3>Deliberate or reckless inaccuracy in respect of big stories</h3>

<p id="para-id-9-35"><a href="#para9-35" name="para9-35">9.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A third category of inaccurate reporting of which the Inquiry heard substantial evidence was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a tendency in parts of the press to set aside the need for rigorous fact checking in the context</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of fast moving and high profile stories. The clearest examples of this practice are the highest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">profile: the defamatory and reckless reporting of the McCanns and Mr Jefferies, dealt with</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Notably, this tendency was not limited to tabloid newspapers: in respect of Mr Jefferies in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular the broadsheets were not blameless. In addition, Mr Davies gave an example of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Guardian&#8217;s reporting of the Haut de la Garenne children&#8217;s home story as an example</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of where the Guardian, amongst others, had published inaccurate articles in circumstances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where greater care would have led to the conclusion that there was no basis for the story.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Consistent with the McCann and Jefferies examples, there was limited information available</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the time of the reports of the alleged murders, torture and burials at the Jersey children&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">home, but a significant public demand for information. Mr Davies said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref458" href="#footnote458">458</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We want the story that will sell papers, so therefore you pick the sexiest possible</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">way of telling it.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The problems that are associated with that I think spread across the spectrum. I&#8217;m</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not exempting the Guardian from problems. We have run stories which were clearly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">false. The Jersey children&#8217;s home &#8211; do you remember that, a couple of years ago &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">where the idea was that the police had evidence that children had been killed and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">buried in the ruins of an old children&#8217;s home on the isle of Jersey. That&#8217;s a classic of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what Richard [Peppiatt] was trying to describe earlier. The evidence for the truth of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that proposition is screaming its falsehood. So, for example, the police said, &#8220;We have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been looking into the ruins of this building and we have found a cellar which is exactly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">like the cellar which is described by our survivor witnesses.&#8221; It&#8217;s &#8220;very dark&#8221;. Cellars</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are dark. It means nothing. Then they said, &#8220;And in this cellar we found a bath&#8221;,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and it&#8217;s quite alarming, this, the sort of hints of torturing. &#8220;It&#8217;s actually bolted to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">floor&#8221;, as though everybody&#8217;s bath was mobile. It&#8217;s silly. It doesn&#8217;t make any sense.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So then the problem that occurred on all newspapers across the whole spectrum</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is it&#8217;s too good a story to knock down. So it&#8217;s exactly what Richard was saying. A</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reporter from any paper is sent out to Jersey to follow up on this story. The reporter</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who rings up and says, &#8220;Actually, this is crap, there&#8217;s just no evidence for this at all&#8221;,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they will not be thanked. It&#8217;s a great story.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-37"><a href="#para9-37" name="para9-37">9.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These examples, along with some others, are part of the evidence base for a broader</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusion, that in respect of stories that become &#8220;big stories&#8221; followed by all the press, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generally involving crime or a very high profile individual, there is a tendency amongst large</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parts of the press to disregard the rule book.</span>

<h3>Inaccurate reporting of political issues to fit the world view of a title</h3>


<p id="para-id-9-38"><a href="#para9-38" name="para9-38">9.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">The Inquiry heard a great deal of evidence on the extent to which newspapers ought to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">distinguish between fact and comment in reporting; a requirement to do so is contained in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Editors&#8217; Code.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref459" href="#footnote459">459</a></sup> It was almost universally accepted by the witnesses who appeared at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry that the distinction between fact and comment, particularly in respect of the reporting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of political issues, had been substantially blurred in recent years. Former Prime Ministers the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rt Hon Tony Blair and the Rt Hon Gordon Brown gave evidence of the corrosive effect that</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref458" name="footnote458" title="Go back to footnote reference 458 in the text">458</a>.  pp85-86, lines 13&#8211;18, Nick Davies, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-29-November-2011.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref459" name="footnote459" title="Go back to footnote reference 459 in the text">459</a>.  Clause 1(iii) of the Code states:<em> &#8220;The Press, whilst free to be partisan, must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact&#8221;</em></p><!--footnote-->
 <span style="font-size: 15px;">this blurring of news and comment could have on political life.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref460" href="#footnote460">460</a></sup> To varying extents, others,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including the Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref461" href="#footnote461">461</a></sup> and the broadcaster Jon Snow,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref462" href="#footnote462">462</a></sup> agreed.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-39"><a href="#para9-39" name="para9-39">9.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although some consideration was given to whether this development justified criticism, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seems to me that the blurring of fact and comment, although prohibited in the Editors&#8217; Code,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is an inevitable part of press reporting in the 21<span style="font-size: 9px;"> st</span> century. That is so for two reasons. First,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because purely factual reporting devoid of all opinion is, to all practical purposes, impossible:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the choice of stories to publish in a newspaper, and the facts chosen to include in a particular</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story, will necessarily be influenced by a newspaper&#8217;s agenda and opinions. Secondly,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because in a world of 24 hour television and online news, readers expect newspapers to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provide something more than pure news: campaigns, opinions and comment are what a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">readership demands and it is not always possible or indeed desirable to divorce these from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pure reporting of the news. That is not to say that newspapers should not seek to identify,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where possible, what is primarily news and what is primarily commentary. But it is to say that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the fusion of news and comment in the press is not necessarily a practice that is harmful</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or worthy of criticism.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-40"><a href="#para9-40" name="para9-40">9.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, what<span style="font-style:italic"> is</span> harmful and what<span style="font-style:italic"> is</span> worthy of criticism is a practice identified in sections of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press of prioritising the worldview of a title over the accuracy of a story. Mr Campbell, a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">supporter of what he called &#8220;agenda journalism&#8221; (where news and comment are necessarily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fused), nonetheless argued that sections of the press had taken agenda journalism to a point</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where it transgressed into the realms of invention and/or reckless inaccuracy.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref463" href="#footnote463">463</a></sup> Mr Peppiatt&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence in relation to the top-down pressure experienced at the Daily Star to uncover stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that fit within a particular &#8220;narrative&#8221; is a prime example of this and is discussed above..</span>

<p id="para-id-9-41"><a href="#para9-41" name="para9-41">9.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Full Fact has monitored press accuracy since April 2010. It provided a comprehensive and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extremely helpful submission<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref464" href="#footnote464">464</a></sup> to the Inquiry which identified a range of inaccurate articles,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including many where the inaccuracy appears to be the result of the title&#8217;s agenda taking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">precedence or assuming too great a significance over and beyond the facts of the underlying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story. It seems that stories on political issues are most likely to suffer from this form of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inaccuracy; examples are considered within the following categories: (i) disability and social</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">welfare benefits; (ii) criminal justice issues; (iii) immigration; and (iv) Europe and Britain&#8217;s role</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">within it.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-42"><a href="#para9-42" name="para9-42">9.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In relation to articles on disability and social welfare benefits, Full Fact provided numerous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examples of misleading articles about the transition from the old Incapacity Benefit (IB) to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the new Employment Support Allowance (ESA). Each article appeared to support an agenda</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of exposing benefit frauds and getting the &#8216;work-shy&#8217; back into work. Full Fact provided many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examples, all of which could have been included in this Report: by way of illustration only,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Third, the Daily Telegraph published an article reporting<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;Nine</span><span style="font-style:italic"> out</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> 10</span><span style="font-style:italic"> sickness</span><span style="font-style:italic"> benefit</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">those in the WRAG, but also those who had withdrawn their claims because their condition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had improved between application and assessment. In that context, it was not only misleading</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to refer to the &#8216;nine out of 10&#8217; as &#8220;fit to work&#8221;, but it was also misleading to include within the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">figures the category of people who had withdrawn their claims and were therefore no longer</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">&#8220;claimants&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref467" href="#footnote467">467</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-9-46"><a href="#para9-46" name="para9-46">9.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The House of Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee was critical of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">coverage of welfare reform in its 6<span style="font-size: 9px;"> th</span> Report. It noted:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref468" href="#footnote468">468</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Sections of the media routinely use pejorative language, such as &#8220;work-shy&#8221; or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;scrounger&#8221;, when referring to incapacity benefit claimants. We strongly deprecate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this and believe that it is irresponsible and inaccurate. The duty on the state to provide</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">adequate support through the benefits system for people who are unable to work</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">because of a serious health condition or illness is a fundamental principle of British</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">society. Portraying the reassessment of incapacity benefit claimants as some sort of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">scheme to &#8220;weed out benefit cheats&#8221; shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">Government&#8217;s objectives.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">41. &#8230; In the end, the media will choose its own angle, but the Government should</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">take great care with the language it itself uses and take all possible steps to ensure</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that context is provided when information about IB claimants found fit for work is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">released, so that unhelpful and inaccurate stories can be shown to have no basis.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-47"><a href="#para9-47" name="para9-47">9.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Select Committee is right to acknowledge that the media is entitled to choose whatever</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">angle on a story it wishes, particularly on matters of political importance. Nonetheless, there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is an important distinction to be made between &#8220;taking an angle&#8221; and plain inaccuracy. It is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">vital that the press is cautious not allow the former to lead to the latter.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Full Fact identified a number of examples of misreporting on criminal justice issues where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it also appears that this line was transgressed. In March 2011, both the Daily Mail and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Daily Express published articles reporting that new sentencing guidelines would allow those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">supplying class A drugs to avoid a custodial sentence if they were playing a &#8216;subordinate&#8217; role</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in a criminal gang. The Daily Mail&#8217;s piece was headlined,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Heroin</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Dealers</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Escape</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Jail:</span><span style="font-style:italic"> new</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">change at all to the approach to sentencing those involved in the supply of drugs, but broadly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">instead preserved the status quo.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref469" href="#footnote469">469</a></sup> Nonetheless, the stories fit within an established agenda</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to resist a general &#8220;softening&#8221; in criminal sentencing.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-49"><a href="#para9-49" name="para9-49">9.49</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Full Fact noted these articles as part of a general trend within parts of the press to misreport</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories on criminal sentencing to give an impression of a judiciary soft on crime and criminals.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Stephen Sedley recently spoke about this narrative in parts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press and expressed his concerns as to its effect. He said to the Joint Committee on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Privacy and Injunctions that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref470" href="#footnote470">470</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;over the 20 years or so since I first became a judge a relentless campaign of accusing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">judges of being soft on crime and under-sentencing has led to the escalation of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sentencing, which has now filled our prisons to bursting, about which it is recognised</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">something needs to be done. That is insidious; it is very difficult to put your finger</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on any one newspaper article or case in which it has happened, but as a trend it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">undoubtedly has happened.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-50"><a href="#para9-50" name="para9-50">9.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Howard League for Penal Reform also gave evidence in relation to the misrepresentation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of criminal sentencing. It noted The Sun&#8217;s article on the sentencing of the mother of Baby</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Peter (formerly known as Baby P), and its expression of outrage that she could &#8220;walk free</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in just over 3 years&#8221;. The reality is that she had been given an indeterminate sentence for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public protection (IPP), with a minimum tariff of five years. Under that sentence, the woman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in question would only be released if she were deemed to pose no risk to the public, failing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which she would remain in prison indefinitely and potentially for life. While it was technically</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">true that, having served almost two years of her sentence on remand, she was eligible to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered for parole after a further three years, the failure to mention that she had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given an IPP sentence, would not be released if she was considered a danger to the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and could remain in prison for life rendered the article significantly misleading.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref471" href="#footnote471">471</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-9-51"><a href="#para9-51" name="para9-51">9.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Similarly misleading reporting was noted in relation to immigration issues (some of which is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discussed above). Further evidence included, for instance, a Daily Mail article alleging that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a failed asylum seeker who had challenged deportation from Britain, was told he could stay</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;because he goes to the gym&#8221;. The article was erroneous on several bases. First, the judge had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not granted the failed asylum seeker any leave to remain in the UK, but had simply required</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Home Office to reconsider his application because of flaws in the decision making process.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, at no stage in the judgment did the judge indicate that the individual&#8217;s membership</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a gym was in any way a factor in his favour. Although one sentence of the judgment referred</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the fact that the individual had made friends at a gym, that sentence was a summary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the failed asylum seeker&#8217;s submissions to the court, rather than any part of the judge&#8217;s</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref469" name="footnote469" title="Go back to footnote reference 469 in the text">469</a>.  p15, <em>ibid</em> .

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">reasoning.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref472" href="#footnote472">472</a></sup> It is unclear if the misunderstanding of the judgment in the article was careless</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or deliberate. Nonetheless, the story fits neatly within a campaign pursued by the newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">against Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, or what the Daily Mail has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">called the &#8220;human right to sponge off the UK&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref473" href="#footnote473">473</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear that immigration had remained stable, but net migration had increased by 20% because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">emigration had fallen.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref474" href="#footnote474">474</a></sup> Another article in the Daily Express, headlined<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Migrants</span><span style="font-style:italic"> more</span><span style="font-style:italic"> likely</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">likely to claim unemployment benefit than people from the UK. In fact the report on which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the article was based concluded that migrants, who were claiming benefits, were more likely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than non-migrants, who were claiming benefits, to be claiming job seekers allowance, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">migrants as a whole were less likely to claim benefits than the UK born population.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref475" href="#footnote475">475</a></sup> Once</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">again, it is unclear whether the errors were careless or deliberate, but they did fit within</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consistent agendas pursued by each newspaper.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-53"><a href="#para9-53" name="para9-53">9.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Articles relating to the European Union, and Britain&#8217;s role within it, accounted for a further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">category of story where parts of the press appeared to prioritise the title&#8217;s agenda over factual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accuracy. On Europe, Mr Campbell said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref476" href="#footnote476">476</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Several of our national daily titIes &#8211; The Sun, The Express, The Star, The Mail,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Telegraph in particular- are broadly anti-European. At various times, readers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of these and other newspapers may have read that &#8217;Europe&#8217; or &#8217;Brussels&#8221; or &#8217;the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">EU superstate&#8217; has banned, or is intending to ban kilts, curries, mushy peas, paper</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rounds, Caerphilly cheese, charity shops, bulldogs, bent sausages and cucumbers,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the British Army, lollipop ladies, British loaves, British made lavatories, the passport</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">crest, lorry drivers who wear glasses, and many more. In addition, if the Eurosceptic</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press is to be believed, Britain is going to-be, forced to unite as a single country with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">France, Church schools are being forced to hire atheist teachers, Scotch whisky is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">being-classified as an inflammable liquid, British soldiers must take orders in French,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the price of chips is being raised by Brussels, Europe is insisting on one size fits all</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">condoms, new laws are being proposed on how to climb, a ladder, it will be a criminal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">offence to criticise Europe, Number 10 must fly the European flag, and finally, Europe</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is brainwashing our children with pro-European propaganda! Of the UK press and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">European institutions &#8211; I speak as something of a Eurosceptic by Blairite standards &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it is clear who does more brainwashing. Some of the examples, may appear trivial,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">comic even. But there is a serious point: that once some of our newspapers decide to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">campaign on a certain issue, they do so with scant regard for fact. These stories are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">written by reporters, rewritten by subs, and edited by editors who frankly must know</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">them to be untrue. This goes beyond the fusion of news and comment, to the area of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">invention.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although Mr Campbell&#8217;s evidence may have been exaggerated for effect, there is certainly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear evidence of misreporting on European issues. Mr Campbell drew attention to a Daily</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">followed by a story that there had been a U-turn and the ban would no longer take place.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The reality is that there had never been a ban proposed and the original story was based</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on a deliberate or careless misinterpretation of EU proposals.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref477" href="#footnote477">477</a></sup> Full Fact drew attention to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a number of further &#8216;anti-EU&#8217; stories which misrepresented facts, including a Daily Express</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">report on EU plans to &#8216;ban&#8217; plastic shopping bags, when the reality was that a consultation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been launched to explore a variety of options, including a potential ban, for reducing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">waste from plastic bags.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref478" href="#footnote478">478</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-9-55"><a href="#para9-55" name="para9-55">9.55</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The factual errors in the examples above are, in certain respects, trivial. But the cumulative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impact can have serious consequences. Mr Blair explained that the misinformation published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about Europe by some parts of the press made it difficult for him to adopt particular policies</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or achieve certain political ends in Europe that he might otherwise have done. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref479" href="#footnote479">479</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;My distinction is between that and how you actually report the story as a piece</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of journalism. So if you take the issue to do with Europe, what I would say is that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">those papers who are Eurosceptic are perfectly entitled to be Eurosceptic. They&#8217;re</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">perfectly entitled to highlight things in Europe that are wrong. What they shouldn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">do is, frankly, make up a whole lot of nonsense about Europe and dish that up to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">readers, because that&#8217;s &#8211; I mean, how does the reader know that&#8217;s not correct?&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-56"><a href="#para9-56" name="para9-56">9.56</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That, ultimately, is the foundation of the criticism made in this section: there can be no</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">objection to agenda journalism (which necessarily involves the fusion of fact and comment),</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but that cannot trump a requirement to report stories accurately. Clause 1 of the Editors&#8217; Code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explicitly, and in my view rightly, recognises the right of a free press to be partisan; strong,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">even very strong, opinions can legitimately influence the choice of story, placement of story</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and angle from which a story is reported. But that must not lead to fabrication, or deliberate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or careless misrepresentation of facts. Particularly in the context of reporting on issues of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political interest, the press have a responsibility to ensure that the public are accurately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">informed so that they can engage in the democratic process. The evidence of inaccurate and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">misleading reporting on political issues is therefore of concern. The previous approach of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC to entertaining complaints only where they came from an affected individual may have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allowed a degree of impunity in this area: in the context of misleading reporting on political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues, representative bodies are likely to be far better placed to monitor, and complain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about, inaccuracies.</span>
<h3>Science reporting</h3>

<p id="para-id-9-57"><a href="#para9-57" name="para9-57">9.57</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In many ways, the imperative for accuracy in political reporting is matched in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">science reporting. There is a significant public interest in the press reporting scientific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advances, discoveries or reports in an easily accessible way. The evidence received by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry suggested that science reporting had improved in recent years and that the majority</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of science reporting was responsible and accurate.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref480" href="#footnote480">480</a></sup> However, in the minority of cases where</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">the press reports a science story carelessly or inaccurately, it can cause substantial damage.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As the Science Media Centre wrote:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref481" href="#footnote481">481</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The potential of the media to influence and inform the public on science comes with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a huge responsibility. When the media gets it wrong the impact is devastating and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">causes real harm to individuals and society. The furore over the measles, mumps</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which started in 1998 after a rogue doctor claimed a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">link between the vaccine and autism, is the best known example of how poor media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reporting can cause harm. Vaccination rates before the story stood at about 92% but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">dropped down to 80% after the scare, and it has taken close to 15 years to get over</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the damage. Cases of measles in England and Wales rose from 56 in 1998 to 1,370</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">in 2008.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-58"><a href="#para9-58" name="para9-58">9.58</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In respect of the MMR story, it is correct that the press as a whole were reporting the work</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a qualified medical practitioner, as published in a respected medical journal. However, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Science Media Centre, the Association of Medical Research Charities, Cancer Research UK, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Wellcome Trust, and Sense about Science all considered that the press shared responsibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the scandal, primarily because a single doctor&#8217;s research, based on a small case study,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which conflicted with all other research in the field and conflicted with the great majority of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">medical opinion, was unjustifiably given front page prominence.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref482" href="#footnote482">482</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-9-59"><a href="#para9-59" name="para9-59">9.59</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The MMR example was cited by each of these organisations as an example of false balance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within the press: that is to say, where the scientific view of a very small minority is given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prominence which suggests that there is a significant conflict of opinion within the scientific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">community.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref483" href="#footnote483">483</a></sup> As Fiona Fox, Chief Executive of the Science Media Centre, said in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the MMR scare:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref484" href="#footnote484">484</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Time and time again the editor demanded that the fact that 99.99999 per cent of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">medical science believed this vaccine to be safe had to be balanced in every article by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Andrew Wakefield or one of his supporters. So you have the terrible situation where</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a MORI poll showed, at the height of this crisis, that nearly 60 per cent of the British</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public thought that medical science was divided. That&#8217;s the bit on which the media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">let the public down.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-60"><a href="#para9-60" name="para9-60">9.60</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">False balance (or on occasion, overtly politicised reporting) was noted as a general concern in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to other topics, including the reporting of GM crops and climate change.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref485" href="#footnote485">485</a></sup> The Daily</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The media often has a tendency to pursue balance in its stories, by countering one</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">claimwithanother,andallowingalternativeviewpointsarightofreply.Thisisperfectly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proper in, for example, political reporting. Yet in science, the practice can often lead</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to distortions of its own. In science, it is often the case that a mainstream opinion</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about the interpretation of known data is shared overwhelmingly by professionals</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in that field, for example with the safety of the MMR vaccine or the link between</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">greenhouse gases and global warming.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">When this is the case, the effect of balancing opinion to stoke debate can be to create</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a misleading impression that dissent from the mainstream view is more widespread</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and serious than it actually is.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-61"><a href="#para9-61" name="para9-61">9.61</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition to a problem of false balance, the Inquiry heard that there is a tendency in parts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press to sensationalise science news headlines. Ms Fox noted that the content of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">copy of science stories, written by science reporters, was generally exemplary, but that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">headlines attached by sub-editors tended to misrepresent and exaggerate the underlying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref488" href="#footnote488">488</a></sup> Those headlines tended to fit within the category of &#8216;scare story&#8217; or &#8216;breakthrough&#8217;.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-62"><a href="#para9-62" name="para9-62">9.62</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Within the category of &#8216;scare story&#8217; the Inquiry saw examples including The Sun&#8217;s headline</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">weekly &#8220;Good Health&#8221; supplement, but it has also been criticised for headlining with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unjustified scare stories. One example seen by the Inquiry was the Daily Mail&#8217;s report of a</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">a causal relationship between interruptions of circadian rhythm and cancer, but suggested</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that further research could investigate whether there might be such a link. Although one of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the researchers said in an interview that turning on an artificial light at night could have an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impact on the body clock, there was no suggestion in the research, nor in the interview, that</span>

<p id="para-id-9-66"><a href="#para9-66" name="para9-66">9.66</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In response to questions from the Inquiry, Martin Clarke, editor of the Mail Online, said that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the article was written from copy supplied by a respectable agency, National News.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref496" href="#footnote496">496</a></sup> Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Clarke also stated that the article was published by others under a very similar headline. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">drew to the attention of the Inquiry the example of Medical Daily, an online trade journal and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">news aggregator for the medical profession, published in the USA.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref497" href="#footnote497">497</a></sup> However, Mr Clarke did</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not mention that the Medical Daily report appears to rely heavily on the Mail&#8217;s own article,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and reads:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref498" href="#footnote498">498</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;&#8220;A few decades ago, it was unthinkable that looking at the brain to understand</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">representations of social groups such as black versus white was even possible, let</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">alone that such explorations could yield useful knowledge,&#8221; the authors wrote,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">according to the Daily Mail.&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-67"><a href="#para9-67" name="para9-67">9.67</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The argument that the article has been provided by an established News Agency, or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">alternatively published by others under a similar headline, if correct, merely serves to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">demonstrate that this lapse of standards occurred in publications beyond the Mail. On any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view, this was contentious and problematic material, and merited careful handling. Further, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not in the nature of a story which necessitated urgent treatment.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-68"><a href="#para9-68" name="para9-68">9.68</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Examples of scare stories are not limited to health journalism; the reporting of climate change</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is also susceptible to exaggeration. When a<span style="font-style:italic"> Nature</span> paper modelling climate change projected</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">warming between 2 degrees and 11 degrees, almost all the newspapers carried the latter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">figure in their headlines, with one tabloid splashing a huge 11 degrees on the front page</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">alongside an apocalyptic image. This was in spite of the fact that the press briefing to launch</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the paper had all emphasised that the vast majority of models showed warming around 2</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">degrees.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref499" href="#footnote499">499</a></sup></span>

 <p id="para-id-9-69"><a href="#para9-69" name="para9-69">9.69</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The impact of these kinds of scare stories can be twofold: first they can create unnecessary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public anxiety, and (as in the case of the MMR scandal) have a consequently detrimental</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impact on public health; and second, they can have a &#8220;cry wolf&#8221; effect, reducing trust in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">science reporting generally.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-70"><a href="#para9-70" name="para9-70">9.70</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The flipside of the scare-story is the overblown &#8216;breakthrough&#8217;. As noted by the Association of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Medical Research Charities, Cancer Research UK, and the Wellcome Trust:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref500" href="#footnote500">500</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Many newspapers (though not all of them) are apt to exaggerate interesting but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">preliminary advances in biomedical science, proclaiming them as groundbreaking</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">achievements that will transform individuals&#8217; health when in fact they are reporting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nothing more than promising results from experiments on mice, or cells grown in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">culture.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-71"><a href="#para9-71" name="para9-71">9.71</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Examples of such stories included stories based on a report in<span style="font-style:italic"> Nature</span> magazine that a drug</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discovered in the soil on Easter Island may have the effect of extending life in mice, but was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expressly said to be harmful to humans. Nonetheless, the headlines included:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;&#8220;Scientists</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">safely in humans. There was no evidence that the stem cells, rather than chance, had caused</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">two of the subjects of the experiment to show marginal improvements in their vision.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref502" href="#footnote502">502</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-9-72"><a href="#para9-72" name="para9-72">9.72</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Such exaggerated &#8216;breakthrough&#8217; reporting can have several negative consequences. First,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it can raise expectations for advances in medical science which are not met. This can feed a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public perception that science is always promising and never delivering. Secondly, it can raise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">false hopes for patients. As the Association of Medical Research Charities, Cancer Research</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">UK, and the Wellcome Trust noted:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref503" href="#footnote503">503</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;This is particularly true and damaging where it concerns treatments for incurable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">diseases that are not proven, yet which are portrayed as &#8220;miracle cures&#8221;. This can</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">lead patients to spend life savings on treatments that are most unlikely to work, or on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">occasion to eschew the most effective known therapies in favour of alternatives that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are untested or disproved.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-73"><a href="#para9-73" name="para9-73">9.73</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Fox suggested that the press ought to exercise a little more caution in the prominence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given to science stories and in the choice of headline. She noted that the press like to publish</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extraordinary claims, but need to ensure that those claims are backed by extraordinary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence. She said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref504" href="#footnote504">504</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We are not proposing that the media ignore extraordinary stories but that they treat</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">them with extra caution and demand at least some strong evidence before going to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">print. This may simply mean putting these stories further inside the paper rather than</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">splashing on the front page, including the voices of third party experts casting doubt</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the findings, and following up these stories with equally significant coverage if the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">claims are refuted.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-74"><a href="#para9-74" name="para9-74">9.74</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Assessing the evidence as a whole, it is clear that science reporting is generally accurate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and responsible. However, the examples of inaccurate reporting identified by the various</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">witnesses demand attention. Given the important public interest in science journalism, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the potential harm caused by overblown or sensational science reporting, greater care is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">needed by parts of the press prior to publishing sensational headlines of breakthroughs or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scares. In addition, further consideration should be given to the need to provide balanced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reporting without giving unjustified credence to minority views.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-75"><a href="#para9-75" name="para9-75">9.75</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At the end of her evidence I invited Ms Fox to provide some draft guidelines for science</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalism which, if followed, would reduce the risk of the press printing the type of story</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that has received critical comment. Ms Fox has responded to that request and has produced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">guidelines<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref505" href="#footnote505">505</a></sup> which in my view are commendable for their utility as well as their succinctness.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Any new regulator should bear them closely in mind.</span>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p id="para-id-9-76"><a href="#para9-76" name="para9-76">9.76</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In their various submissions and representations to the Inquiry, the Press Core Participants</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and others with a similar interest have urged on me that factual error cannot be eliminated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in press reporting, and that the evidence adduced to the Inquiry falls short of supporting the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposition that the problem is sufficiently serious or widespread to be classed as systemic,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cultural or generic. I have paid close regard to these submissions, and I have not lost sight</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the point that the Inquiry is inevitably taking a snap-shot of a picture which is immensely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complexandmulti-faceted.Ihavealreadymadethepointthattheissueisnotaboutquantity.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref506" href="#footnote506">506</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Taking all these matters on board, and assessing the evidence as a whole, I have come to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusion that there does exist a cultural strand or tendency within a section of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to practice journalism which on occasion is deliberately, recklessly or negligently inaccurate.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In other words, this is not simply a matter of accidental (or co-incidental) understandable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">human error.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-77"><a href="#para9-77" name="para9-77">9.77</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The reasons for the existence of this cultural strand go further than the obvious and basic fact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that stories are often written under pressure of approaching deadlines and it is inevitable that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">errors will occur. The pressures I am particularly concerned about are of a different nature:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specifically, the commercial and personal pressures operating on journalists in an extremely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">competitive market to be the first to achieve the &#8216;scoop&#8217;, to place a novel slant on a story</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which otherwise lacks punch, or at worst to manufacture the facts or detail of a story to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">maintain the interest of the readership.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-78"><a href="#para9-78" name="para9-78">9.78</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As with other similar cultural problems which I have identified in this Chapter, the requirement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is for the creation of a regulator with more robust powers, not to censor or control the content</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of press reporting but to set out firmer and clearer ethical and professional standards whose</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adherence would directly lead to far fewer (measured both qualitatively and quantitatively)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the types of sub-standard reporting this chapter has identified. In that regard, the value of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the work carried out by Full Fact is extremely important and I am pleased to recognise that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Full Fact can claim to be one of the organisations that does seek to &#8216;guard the guardians&#8217;.</span>

<h2>10. Financial controls and payments for stories</h2>
<h3>Controls on payments</h3>

<p id="para-id-10-1"><a href="#para10-1" name="para10-1">10.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Operation Motorman revelations, along with the evidence of phone hacking at NoTW</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">highlighted a significant problem with the control over cash payments within a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper titles. The evidence received by the Inquiry suggests that some improvements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been introduced to address the supervision of cash payments,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref507" href="#footnote507">507</a></sup> but there was certainly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some evidence to suggest that more could be done in some titles.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref508" href="#footnote508">508</a></sup> Without engaging in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence relating to payments to public officials, which for reasons already described cannot</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be addressed in any detail, it is not possible to conclude in this Report that the supervision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and control of cash payments is a practice for which the press, or parts of the press, deserve</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criticism as a whole.</span>

<p id="para-id-10-2"><a href="#para10-2" name="para10-2">10.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, the evidence heard by the Inquiry did raise substantial concerns in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the payment of sources generally, whether by cash or electronically. The concern arises</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not necessary because those sources are or are likely to be acting unlawfully (such as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Whittamore or Mr Mulcaire), but because the very act of payment may reduce the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reliability of the information, and/or encourage breaches of privacy.</span>

<p id="para-id-10-3"><a href="#para10-3" name="para10-3">10.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">The evidence of the &#8216;fake stories&#8217; and &#8216;medical records&#8217; stings in Mr Atkins&#8217; &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic"> Starsuckers&#8217;</span> shone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a light on this problematic issue. The evidence heard by the Inquiry is that the practice of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">paying sources for stories was widespread and continuing. Although there are undoubtedly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstances in which payments for stories may be justified (see the MPs&#8217; expenses stories)</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the evidence suggested payments for stories may incentivise exaggeration or fabrication and/</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or encourage breaches of privacy. For those reasons, it is worth exploring the evidence of this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice in some detail.</span>

<p id="para-id-10-4"><a href="#para10-4" name="para10-4">10.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has been told that virtually all tabloid newspapers accept stories from members</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the public, and indeed, many pay for that information. Most broadsheets, including the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Financial Times, The Independent, the Daily Telegraph, The Times and the Guardian do not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">actively seek stories from the public and prefer not to work in this way, but all except the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Guardian and the Financial Times would still pay for information if justified by the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref509" href="#footnote509">509</a></sup></span>

<h3>Advertising for stories</h3>

<p id="para-id-10-5"><a href="#para10-5" name="para10-5">10.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both journalists and editors have told the Inquiry that they regard tip-offs from the general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public as an important source of legitimate information. In particular, they have made clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the importance of such information to newspapers should be recognised in the form</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of payment to the individuals who supply it. In his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Myler said</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it was entirely legitimate for newspapers to make payments to sources for information</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">paid and rewarded for legitimate tips, information and stories.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref511" href="#footnote511">511</a></sup> However, there is perhaps</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a difference between making payment for a tip-off that is made without encouragement or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">request, and actively soliciting tip-offs through advertising for stories.</span>

<p id="para-id-10-6"><a href="#para10-6" name="para10-6">10.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Traditionally, the tabloid press has advertised for information or stories through prominent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advertisements in the pages of the particular newspaper and, in some cases, on the straplines</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of relevant columns, or through prominently sited and easy to find web-pages. Mr Smart</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">confirmed The Sun&#8217;s approach: page 2 of the newspaper routinely carries a telephone number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that members of the public can call directly if they have stories that they perceive to be of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potential interest to the newspaper.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref512" href="#footnote512">512</a></sup> By way of example, on Friday 30th March 2011, this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advertisement read:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Get cash for your stories:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We are always after good story &#8211; and we pay big money for them every day. If you&#8217;ve</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">got a story about a celebrity, a scandal, a human interest story or any other great tip,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">call our newsdesk today. Don&#8217;t worry about the cost &#8211; we&#8217;ll call you straight back.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-10-7"><a href="#para10-7" name="para10-7">10.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition to the telephone number The Sun also provides an email address and Twitter link</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">through which members of the public might contact the paper.</span>

<p id="para-id-10-8"><a href="#para10-8" name="para10-8">10.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Just like The Sun, the NoTW also advertised for stories, drawing the attention of readers to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">payments, (sometimes in cash but also by cheque or electronic means) that the newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might make for those stories. In addition to advertisements carried on both its website and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the pages of the newspaper itself, the NoTW also asked readers to suggest potential lines</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Inquiry that its one time investigative journalist, Mr Mahmood, might further investigate.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">That call was carried on the byline for Mr Mahmood&#8217;s column and read:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref513" href="#footnote513">513</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Do you know a scandal that Maz should expose? If so, you can ring him any time.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-10-9"><a href="#para10-9" name="para10-9">10.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition to an email address, a phone number was also provided to facilitate that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">communication from readers. The NoTW was unique in advertising for members of the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to help inform potential lines of Inquiry for the investigative journalists at the newspaper,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and in fact Mr Mahmood has said that only a very few investigations were initiated as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consequence of information received from members of the public.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref514" href="#footnote514">514</a></sup> Mostly, where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers do advertise for stories, it is made clear, as is explored below, that the interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is in stories related to celebrities and other individuals with a public profile or, on a more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">limited basis, other human interest stories.</span>

<p id="para-id-10-10"><a href="#para10-10" name="para10-10">10.10</a></p>
 The Daily Mirror also advertises for stories and promises &#8216;big</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> monies&#8217;</span> for them.<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Particularly,
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it makes mention of stories relating to celebrities and other people with a public profile.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Like The Sun, the Daily Mirror advertises for stories both on the paper as well as on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper&#8217;s website through a link from the front page entitled &#8216;sell your story&#8217;.</span>

 The Daily Star also advertises for stories througha dedicated page on its website accessed
<span style="font-size: 15px;">through a drop-down link from the landing page of the newspaper&#8217;s website. That page</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">reads:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref515" href="#footnote515">515</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-10-12"><a href="#para10-12" name="para10-12">10.12</a></p>
 In evidence to the Inquiry, representatives from the Daily Star emphasised the importance
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of showbusiness and celebrity stories to that paper. Ms Neesom, told the Inquiry that as the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">title was a relatively young newspaper it did not have the same established readership as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some of its competitors.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref516" href="#footnote516">516</a></sup> The paper therefore needed to ensure that the content it carried</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appealed to its readership. Ms Neesom said that reader interest lay substantially in stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the lives of celebrities and other individuals with a public profile.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref517" href="#footnote517">517</a></sup> A number of these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories were sourced from members of the public responding to the call for stories published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the Star newspaper itself.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref518" href="#footnote518">518</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-10-13"><a href="#para10-13" name="para10-13">10.13</a></p>
 The Daily Express also advertises for stories through its website. Readers are encouraged
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to contact the paper through a number of media, including telephone, email and SMS text</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">message. It is notable that the Daily Express website makes no mention of payment in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exchange for information.</span>

<h3>Levels of payment for material</h3>

<p id="para-id-10-14"><a href="#para10-14" name="para10-14">10.14</a></p>
 Levels of payment for information vary from newspaper to newspaper.</span> Peter<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Wright, the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">former editor of the Mail on Sunday, said that at the Mail Group payments of up to &#163;50,000</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were made for information during his tenure.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref519" href="#footnote519">519</a></sup> However, he was also clear that such an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">amount would be paid in exceptional circumstances and only for a story of substantive and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significant interest to the readers of Mail Group newspapers. Typically, such a story would take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the form of an in-depth interview or a book serialisation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref520" href="#footnote520">520</a></sup> More typically, Mr Wright said,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the amounts paid by the Mail Group for stories, and particularly to members of the public,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were much smaller: in 2010, the highest amount paid was &#163;3,500, and<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;they</span><span style="font-style:italic"> would</span><span style="font-style:italic"> most</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a lot less than that&#8217;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref521" href="#footnote521">521</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Wright</span><span style="font-style:normal"> said</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> whilst</span><span style="font-style:normal"> most</span><span style="font-style:normal"> payments</span><span style="font-style:normal"> were</span><span style="font-style:normal"> made</span><span style="font-style:normal"> electronically,</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Mail Group would also make cash payments, because some of those individuals supplying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material might not have bank accounts.</span>

 In this respect, the operation of payment systems at the Daily Mail was similar to that at
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Sun. There, cash payments were still made in a small number of circumstances. It was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for individual journalists to make such requests for payments to senior staff and managing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editors for authorisation. Whilst the amounts that could be paid for information to third</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parties could be significant, they were dependent on the final size of the story when published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and also the likely interest of the subject of the story to the readers. Typically, payments for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories made by The Sun ranged from between &#163;600 and &#163;10,000 depending on the size and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nature of the story.</span>

<p id="para-id-10-16"><a href="#para10-16" name="para10-16">10.16</a></p>
A similar scale of payment for information also existed at the NoTW. Mr Thurlbeck said that
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information leading to a front page splash might result in payments of up to &#163;20,000.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref522" href="#footnote522">522</a></sup> Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">McMullan explained that journalists working at the title, particularly those journalists working</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the showbusiness desk, had access to substantive budgets without real oversight.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref523" href="#footnote523">523</a></sup> Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">McMullan has said that, as deputy features editor, he was able spend amounts of up to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#163;10,000 on stories that resulted in a double page spread.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref524" href="#footnote524">524</a></sup> In this position, he was able to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">make payments of up to &#163;3,000 for a page lead, and sums of between &#163;5,000 and &#163;10,000</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for larger stories.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref525" href="#footnote525">525</a></sup> Payments of more than &#163;1,000 for any other story had to be authorised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the then editor.</span>

<p id="para-id-10-17"><a href="#para10-17" name="para10-17">10.17</a></p>
 Although the Inquiry has heard that payments for stories supplied by members of the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public would not normally exceed &#163;10,000, other witnesses have suggested that in certain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstances, payments for certain stories, in particular &#8220;kiss and tell&#8221; stories involving</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals with a significant public profile, could be much higher. Mr Shear explained that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">competitive pressures could put significant upward pressure on payments made if the papers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerned understood the stories in question to be profitable.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref526" href="#footnote526">526</a></sup> Mr Shear said that if stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involved a significantly high-profile celebrity, a kiss-and-tell story might cost: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> something</span><span style="font-style:italic"> like</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">10k to half a million.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref527" href="#footnote527">527</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Indeed,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Thurlbeck</span><span style="font-style:normal"> claimed</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Rebecca</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Loos</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> paid</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span><span style="font-style:normal"> six</span><span style="font-style:normal"> figure</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sum for information about her relationship with the footballer, David Beckham.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref528" href="#footnote528">528</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-10-18"><a href="#para10-18" name="para10-18">10.18</a></p>
 Similarly,</span> in Mr<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Atkins&#8217;</span> discussions witha NoTW journalist in relation to his<span style="font-weight:normal;"> &#8216;medical records
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sting&#8217;, the journalist set out the paper&#8217;s willingness to pay amounts substantially greater</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than &#163;10,000 for stories of likely interest to readers and therefore of potential value.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref529" href="#footnote529">529</a></sup> Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Atkins recorded the journalist as suggesting that the NoTW might be willing to pay &#163;80,000,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">depending on the strength of the story.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref530" href="#footnote530">530</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-10-19"><a href="#para10-19" name="para10-19">10.19</a></p>
 Irrespective of the final amounts that have been paid it is clear that issues around payment
<span style="font-size: 15px;">formedanimportantpartofdiscussions betweenjournalistsand theirinterlocutors. MrAtkins</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence described his efforts to supply and sell information to a number of newspapers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including the Sunday Mirror and the NoTW explaining that levels of payment were raised at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the very outset of his discussions with the journalists from each newspaper.</span>

 <h3>Accuracy and the credibility of material supplied by members of the public</h3>

<h4>Corroboration</h4>

<p id="para-id-10-20"><a href="#para10-20" name="para10-20">10.20</a></p>
 The specific concerns at payments for information crystallise not principally around the type
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of information disclosed by sources in exchange for payment, but rather that the fact of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">payment might encourage the sources of that information to exaggerate, distort or simply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fabricate the information that they seek to sell. The section above dealing with Mr Atkins&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;fake stories&#8217; sting suggests that the mechanisms for corroborating such information given by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">third parties may not be particularly effective.</span>

 The Inquiry has received evidence froma number of different newspapers about the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">processes followed to establish the credibility of stories and the veracity of accusations that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may have been made by members of the public in the information they seek to sell. These</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">processes were also designed to protect newspapers from potential legal actions for libel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or defamation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref531" href="#footnote531">531</a></sup> Although not uniform, the descriptions of such processes in evidence to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry from journalists at The Sun, the Daily Mirror and the Daily Star, as well as at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW, are similar.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref532" href="#footnote532">532</a></sup> It is illustrative of practices across parts of the press that these processes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were not formal and whilst a number of witnesses to the Inquiry have claimed that they were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generally practised, they were not obligatory or uniformly enforced.</span>

<p id="para-id-10-22"><a href="#para10-22" name="para10-22">10.22</a></p>
 Mr Smart described in broad terms the efforts made by journalists to establish both the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">credibility and reliability of stories that were provided by members of the public. These</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">efforts might include journalists separately seeking corroboration of any allegations made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">through a number of sources.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref533" href="#footnote533">533</a></sup> This might be done through contacting the subject of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story directly or indirectly through their agents or other representatives.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref534" href="#footnote534">534</a></sup> Mr Smart said</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the showbusiness journalists at The Sun had excellent contacts, particularly with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">likely subject of stories submitted to the paper by members of the public; these contacts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enable these journalists who might be pursuing such stories quickly to stand them up.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref535" href="#footnote535">535</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-10-23"><a href="#para10-23" name="para10-23">10.23</a></p>
A similar process is also followed at the Daily Mirror in response to potential stories supplied
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the paper by members of the public. The practice there is to discuss potential stories with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those who cold contact the paper, to make an initial assessment of the credibility as well as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the value as a news item all during the initial telephone call. In those circumstances where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists perceive stories to be credible, they might meet with the source to discuss the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material further. Mr Owens suggested that journalists at the Mirror newspapers might also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discuss the merits of a story with more senior colleagues on the news desk before deciding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether to pursue it further. Mr Owens also said that journalists working at the Sunday</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mirror had access to a lawyer in the office at all times, to whom any concerns with stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could be addressed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref536" href="#footnote536">536</a></sup> In-house lawyers might also be involved in discussions with the news</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">desk about the merits of a given story.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref537" href="#footnote537">537</a></sup></span>

 <p id="para-id-10-24"><a href="#para10-24" name="para10-24">10.24</a></p>
 Ms Neesom explained that it was the practice at the Daily Star to seek to corroborate all
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories that were supplied by third parties.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref538" href="#footnote538">538</a></sup> However, Ms Neesom also accepted that, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some cases, corroboration was not always possible, as the individuals in question were not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">always contactable.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref539" href="#footnote539">539</a></sup> A failure to corroborate a story might not prevent its publication; this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was so, particularly, if the story were unlikely to lead to the launch of legal challenge by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual concerned. She also suggested that, in many cases, stories leaked to the newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by PR representatives working on behalf of particular celebrities would not be checked, given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that they stories were essentially coming from the celebrity him or herself.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref540" href="#footnote540">540</a></sup> The Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was told that information submitted to the paper by members of the public, particularly in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to so-called &#8220;kiss and tell&#8221; stories involving celebrities and other individuals with a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public profile, was difficult to corroborate satisfactorily with the result that it was now less</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">likely to be published than it once was.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref541" href="#footnote541">541</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-10-25"><a href="#para10-25" name="para10-25">10.25</a></p>
 These informal mechanisms and processes for establishing the credibility ofa story are also
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described and elaborated by Ms Marshall in her memoir,<span style="font-style:italic"> Tabloid</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Girl</span> . Ms Marshall explained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that when contacted by members of the public, journalists would pose a number of questions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relating to that celebrity. According to Ms Marshall, the purpose in asking such questions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was intended to help separate those members of the public who may possess stories of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potential interest to readers from those who had contacted the newspaper in the hope</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of securing payment for either spurious or fabricated information. Ms Marshall explained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the questions asked by journalists in these circumstances were often informed by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specialist knowledge that they may have about the celebrities about whom they wrote.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref542" href="#footnote542">542</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This knowledge may be the result of relationships built up over a number of years with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">celebrities in question.</span>

<h4>Numbers</h4>

<p id="para-id-10-26"><a href="#para10-26" name="para10-26">10.26</a></p>
 Although representatives of the press who have given evidence to the Inquiry have not
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provided exact figures for the number of calls received from members of the public seeking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to supply stories, they were clear that the numbers were substantial and provided the source</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material for a significant proportion of showbusiness stories each year. Mr Smart provided</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some sense of the scale of the information supplied in this way, as well as the demands on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists working on showbusiness stories which accounted for the majority of telephone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">calls received.</span>

<p id="para-id-10-27"><a href="#para10-27" name="para10-27">10.27</a></p>
 Mr Smart explained that the Bizarre column at The Sun received many thousands of
<span style="font-size: 15px;">telephone calls in response to advertisements in the paper calling for readers to sell their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories. He noted that the small team of journalists working on the Bizarre column produced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approximately 60,000 stories each year. On average, each journalist working on that column</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was responsible for researching and writing up over 3,000 individual stories.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref543" href="#footnote543">543</a></sup> He explained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that those stories provided by members of the public were important to helping achieve</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those targets.</span>

 <p id="para-id-10-28"><a href="#para10-28" name="para10-28">10.28</a></p>
 Similarly, Mr Owens suggested that the volume of information received from members of the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public at the Sunday Mirror was significant. Mr Owens said that the Sunday Mirror received</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;dozens&#8221; of stories each day from members of the public.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref544" href="#footnote544">544</a></sup> Mr McMullan also reported</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, during his time at the NoTW, he would receive up to 30 telephone calls each day from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">members of the public seeking to sell their stories.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref545" href="#footnote545">545</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-10-29"><a href="#para10-29" name="para10-29">10.29</a></p>
 Asa consequence, Mr Smart suggested that the volume of work required to produce sufficient
<span style="font-size: 15px;">copy as well as the very real limitations on resources available to journalists militated against</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the corroboration of all stories.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref546" href="#footnote546">546</a></sup> Mr Smart said that it was the practice of the showbusiness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">desk only to seek to stand up the two lead stories or those which were most contentious.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref547" href="#footnote547">547</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Smaller stories and those which were unlikely to cause offence or reputational damage would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not normally be fully corroborated.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref548" href="#footnote548">548</a></sup> Mr Owens also admitted that, given the quantities of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information received from the public, it was not always possible to run full checks on stories.</span>
<h4>Judging whether a story is credible</h4>

<p id="para-id-10-30"><a href="#para10-30" name="para10-30">10.30</a></p>
A decision to runa story without having fully established the credibility ofa source might be
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justified on a number of grounds. First, journalists might seek to establish some of the facts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">around a story but not necessarily all details, proceeding with the publication of the story</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the basis of that partial corroboration. Second, as described in evidence by Mr Smart,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists might judge that a story was credible given their knowledge of the individuals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerned or the knowledge of others individuals linked to that person.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref549" href="#footnote549">549</a></sup> As an example, Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Smart said that he decided to publish stories supplied to him by the documentary film-maker</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Atkins, which later turned out to be fabricated, because they chimed with his knowledge</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the people concerned. In response to questions about the likely veracity of a story supplied</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by Mr Atkins about the film maker Guy Ritchie (who it was alleged had injured himself while</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">drunkenly juggling cutlery in a London restaurant), Mr Smart suggested he had known that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Ritchie had been in the restaurant in question at the time, and that he had managed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">corroborate that Mr Ritchie was drunk at the time and was &#8216;misbehaving&#8217;. Mr Smart said that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the references to juggling came only at the end of the article and were an &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> insignificant</span> &#8221; part</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> trivial</span><span style="font-style:italic"> story</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref550" href="#footnote550">550</a></sup> However, Mr Smart did concede that it was unacceptable that somebody</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be able deliberately to make up a story and that such a story should then appear in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref551" href="#footnote551">551</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-10-31"><a href="#para10-31" name="para10-31">10.31</a></p>
 In relation toa story by Mr Atkins alleging that the singer Sarah Harding hada library full
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of books on astro-physics, Mr Smart suggested that, as a personal acquaintance of Miss</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Harding, he was well placed to judge the credibility of Mr Atkins&#8217; claim. Mr Smart told the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry that he knew that Miss Harding had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> quite</span><span style="font-style:italic"> an</span><span style="font-style:italic"> impressive</span><span style="font-style:italic"> library</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref552" href="#footnote552">552</a></sup> He also said that</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">publishing the story, even though the fundamental allegation in the story remained untrue.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is to note that, although in both of these cases the central allegation remained untrue, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">general corroboration of some of the details of the allegations by the respective agents of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Miss Harding and Mr Ritchie enabled Mr Smart to stand up the story sufficiently to mitigate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the risk of legal action from either party.</span>

<h3>Risks of payments for stories</h3>

<p id="para-id-10-32"><a href="#para10-32" name="para10-32">10.32</a></p>
 There are two significant risks associated with the advertisement by newspapers for stories:
<span style="font-size: 15px;">first, that it may incentivise fabrication and/or exaggeration, and second that it may encourage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breaches of privacy. The Inquiry has seen evidence of both.</span>
<h4>Incentivising fabrication and exaggeration</h4>

<p id="para-id-10-33"><a href="#para10-33" name="para10-33">10.33</a></p>
 In his evidence, Mr Atkins argued that the willingness of newspapers to pay for stories
<span style="font-size: 15px;">encouraged distortion and exaggeration on the part of sources and incentivised fabrication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of material, particularly as the materials provided may frequently go unchecked and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unverified.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref554" href="#footnote554">554</a></sup> Mr Atkins also said that, in his view, given the potentially very high level of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">payments involved, those members of the public seeking to sell stories to newspapers were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">often motivated more by profit than accuracy.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref555" href="#footnote555">555</a></sup> Further, he suggested that the journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he spoke with encouraged him to exaggerate the more sensational aspects of the stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in question, in order that they might deliver more newsworthy content to their editors. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Atkins noted in his evidence that the more &#8220;outlandish&#8221; and sensational the stories he offered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the newspapers, the higher the level of payment that was offered in return.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref556" href="#footnote556">556</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-10-34"><a href="#para10-34" name="para10-34">10.34</a></p>
 By way of example, Mr Atkins described to the Inquiry his attempt to sella story about the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Canadian pop singer, Avril Lavigne. Mr Atkins explained that he contacted the Daily Express</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and attempted to see if he might be able to interest the newspaper in a story about the singer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">falling asleep in the nightclub, Bungalow 8. Although the story was rejected by the journalist</span>

 Mr Davies explained that the Guardian had adopted the approach that, asa matter of
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principle, it would not pay for stories. He sought to explain that reasoning as one driven by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practicalities rather than ethical, legal or financial considerations (although consideration of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those issues had helped to inform the Guardian&#8217;s position).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref558" href="#footnote558">558</a></sup> Essentially at one with Mr Leigh,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the position of Mr Davies was that the purchase of information might lead individuals to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fabricate material or exaggerate the extent and impact of material in order to increase the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">value of that information.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref559" href="#footnote559">559</a></sup></span>

 Mr Leigh gavea specific example ofa situation in which the Guardian had maintained this
<span style="font-size: 15px;">position, even where the information for sale was thought to be in the public interest. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">spoke of a potential story about the infiltration by a major weapons manufacturer of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Campaign Against the Arms Trade. The source of the information, who Mr Leigh and his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">colleagues believed to be credible, had requested payment of approximately &#163;20,000. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Leigh said that whilst he believed that the story was in the public interest, he could not in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstance justify the sum of money requested and also because it caused concerns that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant details had been embellished or exaggerated.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref560" href="#footnote560">560</a></sup> Mr Leigh also made it clear that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not think that it would be possible to stand up the story without the information held by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his source.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref561" href="#footnote561">561</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-10-37"><a href="#para10-37" name="para10-37">10.37</a></p>
 The Guardian&#8217;s</span> approach is admirable<span style="font-weight:normal;"> and, by adoptinga hard line on payments for
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information, the risk of fabrication and/or exaggeration is substantially limited. However, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">saying that, I should not be interpreted as saying that the Guardian&#8217;s approach is the only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legitimate approach and should therefore be adopted by all titles. As noted above, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Daily Telegraph paid a substantial sum of money for the information which led to the MPs&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expenses scandal and I have made no criticism of the Telegraph&#8217;s decision to pay that money.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Times, The Independent and the Daily Telegraph also made clear that they would pay</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for stories, exceptionally, if they perceived there to be a clear public interest in the story in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question. I accept that there may be many circumstances in which payments for information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are justified in the public interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-10-38"><a href="#para10-38" name="para10-38">10.38</a></p>
I also accept that payments for information may also be acceptable in the pursuit of pure
<span style="font-size: 15px;">entertainment stories or diary pages, provided that the publication does not lead to the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication of fiction, and/or the breach of privacy (see below).It is essential that titles which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">choose to make payments for stories (whether in the public interest, or merely because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they interest the public) are fully aware of the risks involved, including the very real risks of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">providing an incentive for fabrication and/or exaggeration. It seems that at present, parts of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press are not sufficiently aware of those risks and do not seek to corroborate or check the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories published.</span>

<h3>Providing an incentive for intrusions into private life</h3>

<p id="para-id-10-39"><a href="#para10-39" name="para10-39">10.39</a></p>
 Afurtherconcernarisingfromthesolicitationofstoriesforpaymentisthatthepracticeprovides
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an incentive for breaches of privacy. The &#8220;kiss and tell&#8221; is a prime example of this. While the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence heard by the Inquiry suggested that traditional &#8220;kiss and tell&#8221; stories are declining,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they are clearly not merely of historic interest and continue to appear in tabloid newspapers.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sometimes, these will involve breaches of privacy justified by the public interest,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref562" href="#footnote562">562</a></sup> but other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">times they will not be so justified. What is clear is that the offer of payment by the individual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">titles is often a significant motivating factor for the (generally) women who sell their stories.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry also heard that the offer of payments to (generally) women involved in intimate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship with well-known people can lead to conduct at least verging on the blackmail of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those people: Mr Flitcroft said that one of the women with whom he was involved demanded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#163;3,000 to keep quiet; a second woman demanded &#163;5,000. One can only infer that those sums</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were close to the sums offered by the newspaper for their stories.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref563" href="#footnote563">563</a></sup></span>

 Inaddition,theevidenceemergingfromthe&#8220;medicalrecordssting&#8221;inChrisAtkins&#8217;</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> Starsuckers
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(discussed above) supports the conclusion that the offer of payments for stories incentivises</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breaches of private life. Notable in that evidence was the discussion between Mr Atkins and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a journalist from the Sunday People, in particular on how the private information could be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">used without revealing that it derived from medical records; the journalist suggested instead</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that a woman who had allegedly had a breast enlargement could be featured in a &#8220;silhouette</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">spread&#8221; or a &#8220;have they, haven&#8217;t they story&#8221;. This causes some concern because it suggests</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that even information that a newspaper judges too private to publish in the form disclosed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the source may be used as the foundation for a different story, which is not based directly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the source material.</span>

<p id="para-id-10-41"><a href="#para10-41" name="para10-41">10.41</a></p>
 Further,</span> as Steve Turner of the BPPA has<span style="font-weight:normal;"> noted, the request by some newspapers for readers
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to send photographs of people in the public eye, in return for payment, has led to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">development of<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;amateur</span><span style="font-style:italic"> celebrity</span><span style="font-style:italic"> chasing</span><span style="font-style:italic"> paparazzi&#8221;</span> or<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;stakerazzi&#8221;.</span> As discussed above in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Section 5 of this Chapter, this has caused significant invasions of privacy for many people in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public eye.</span>

<p id="para-id-10-42"><a href="#para10-42" name="para10-42">10.42</a></p>
 It is important to note that the payment for information about the private life of an individual
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may not always be unethical. It may also be ethical in certain circumstances to pay for a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographsprovidedbymembersofthepublic. Ishould makeitabsolutelyclearthatIamnot</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advocating the banning of payments for information, even payments for private information.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">What concerns me is the degree to which some newspapers appear to rely on the provision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of private information to fill their pages, and therefore actively encourage the disclosure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of private information via eye-catching advertisements which offer monetary reward. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach risks the wholesale disclosure of private information without consideration of the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest in doing so. Even if the newspaper does not subsequently publish the disclosed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information, the disclosure is itself a breach of privacy.</span>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p id="para-id-10-43"><a href="#para10-43" name="para10-43">10.43</a></p>
 Plainly, there are circumstances where the making of payment for information for stories is
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clearly illegal as a matter of criminal law: the Bribery Act 2010 forbids the payments to public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">officials, and there is no defence based on actual or perceived public interest. The extent of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such criminal activity is not a matter for this Inquiry given that it forms the basis of Operation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Elveden.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref564" href="#footnote564">564</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-10-44"><a href="#para10-44" name="para10-44">10.44</a></p>
 Beyond the specific confines of the Bribery Act, the paying of sources for information is not
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contrary to the criminal law (although it should be noted and underscored that the general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principle which permits the protection of the confidentiality of sources does not justify</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">paying money to a public official and then &#8216;protecting&#8217; his or her identity), although it may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">often be unethical, for a number of clear and obvious reasons. First, the source may require</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">payment for the very reason that he or she has obtained the information in question by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">illegal, unethical or otherwise dubious means, and the payment is, as it were, the price for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taking the risk. Second, the fact that a source apparently requires payment for supplying the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information in question may well be an incentive for exaggeration and embellishment. Put</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">another way, it is legitimate to argue that a source who provides information without seeking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remuneration for it is more likely to be acting out of sound motives. Third, the offering of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">money for stories may well encourage members of the public to engage in intrusive methods</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in circumstances where there is no clear public interest.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref564" name="footnote564" title="Go back to footnote reference 564 in the text">564</a>.  Part E, Chapter 5</p><!--footnote-->
 <p id="para-id-10-45"><a href="#para10-45" name="para10-45">10.45</a></p>
 Overall, paying for information may be seen as increasing the risk of unethical if not illegal
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conduct by the source and, in consequence, by the journalist acting on the information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">purchased. In order to reduce these risks to acceptable levels, if newspapers are to continue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to offer payment for stories, at the very least what is required are clear and effective internal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">systems of accountability and reporting, together with an acute assessment of where the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest lies. In large parts of the press, this does not appear to have been occurring.</span>

<a name="section11"></a>
<h2>11. Treatment of critics</h2>

<p id="para-id-11-1"><a href="#para11-1" name="para11-1">11.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The way in which an individual, an organisation, or an industry treats its critics can reveal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a lot about its culture. Openness to legitimate criticism is the hallmark of many thriving</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisations and industries. By contrast, defensiveness and intimidation in response to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legitimate criticism tends to be a feature of closed-minded and entrenched industries. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">phone hacking scandal as a whole revealed that large parts of the press tended to the latter:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">over the course of five years, much of the press showed a complete unwillingness to engage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with those critics who pointed to evidence of unlawful and unethical practices within one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper, and to practices which are likely to have taken place in others too. Indeed, rather</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than engaging with those critics, much of the press subjected them to intense scrutiny,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occasionally amounting to intimidation.</span>

<p id="para-id-11-2"><a href="#para11-2" name="para11-2">11.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The clearest example of this is the approach adopted by NI in response to high profile phone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking critics. As discussed above,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref565" href="#footnote565">565</a></sup> lawyers bringing claims against NI were subjected</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to ongoing surveillance, commissioned with a view to trying to force them to remove</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">themselves from the litigation. Similarly a member of the CMS Select Committee was placed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under surveillance during its investigation of phone hacking. Mr Webb confirmed that he was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">instructed to place Tom Watson MP under surveillance for a period of a week, trying to prove</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an alleged affair (which was not in fact taking place) in order to pressure Mr Watson to step</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">back from the phone hacking issue. Another member of the Select Committee Mr Bryant,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">told the Inquiry of his experience of direct intimidation. In early 2011 he was called by a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">friend who informed him that two people close to Rupert Murdoch had warned that it would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be wise for Mr Bryant to desist from the phone hacking investigations, or Mr Murdoch would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;get him, in time&#8221;. While there is not the slightest evidence to suggest that Mr Murdoch had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in fact made any threats, there is no reason to doubt that a phone call between Mr Bryant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and his friend took place and that something which could be construed as a threat purporting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be from Mr Murdoch was passed on. Mr Bryant said that further threats were passed on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in March 2011.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref566" href="#footnote566">566</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-11-3"><a href="#para11-3" name="para11-3">11.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Grant, who was seen as a figurehead of the Hacked Off campaign, was also the subject of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">threats. The mother of his child was called by an anonymous caller when he was on television</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discussing the phone hacking issue and told to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Tell</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Hugh</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Grant</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> shut</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> fuck</span><span style="font-style:italic"> up!</span> &#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref567" href="#footnote567">567</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-11-4"><a href="#para11-4" name="para11-4">11.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These examples of surveillance and intimidation in the context of the phone hacking scandal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are particularly egregious. It seems clear that certain people within the NoTW, or, perhaps,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unsought supporters, were determined to prevent many of the facts discussed at elsewhere<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref568" href="#footnote568">568</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chapter 4 from being revealed, and so resorted to deeply unethical methods to prevent that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from happening. However, although the evidence as a whole did not suggest that the use</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">of direct threats and the like by the press was commonplace, the limited evidence of those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">methods in the context of the phone hacking scandal was consistent with evidence given by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a number of the Core Participants complaining of press misconduct, who spoke to a general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">atmosphere of intimidation by parts of the press. The evidence of that atmosphere came</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in two forms: first, evidence of the press launching direct personal attacks on critics; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">second, evidence from a wide range of witnesses of a failure to speak out or criticise, litigate,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or seek assistance from the regulator, for fear of the personal consequences.</span>

<p id="para-id-11-5"><a href="#para11-5" name="para11-5">11.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry saw numerous examples of parts of the press adopting attack as the best form</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of defence against critics. When Mr Peppiatt resigned from the Daily Star and published his</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">A more conventional example of the attack by a newspaper of a critic is the Daily Mail&#8217;s story</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Witnesses who had pursued litigation against newspaper titles gave evidence that parts of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press sought retribution against those who brought claims against a newspaper title.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomson, said that a successful action invariably led to retribution. He explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref574" href="#footnote574">574</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been chastised for complaining, for going to law to get remedies, and it&#8217;s a sort of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">tactic to undermine their vindication by trashing the claimant.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8230; Of course they can comment on the judicial process in the sense of, &#8220;Oh, well,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I don&#8217;t think that injunction should have been granted&#8221;, but &#8211; this is my opinion,</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my suspicion is: well, if they go to law, we&#8217;ll give them a good trashing and it will</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">because it happens, as I said, almost invariably. Let&#8217;s make it difficult for them, let&#8217;s</span>

 Ms Rowling gave an example of what might be thought of as small-scale retribution by the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press. In 2005, she had complained to the PCC in respect of the Daily Mirror publishing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her address. A matter of five days after the complaint was made, the Mirror published a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photograph of Ms Rowling&#8217;s daughter as a baby, despite the fact it was well known that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">she was fiercely protective of her children&#8217;s privacy and objected to the publication of their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographs. Her view was that the Daily Mirror&#8217;s decision to publish the photograph was a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deliberate act of spite in response to her complaint.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref576" href="#footnote576">576</a></sup></span>

 Mr Mosley provideda considerably larger scale example when describing the course of his
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privacy litigation against the NoTW. In response to Mr Mosley&#8217;s application for an injunction</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to prevent (re)publication of the offending article and video, and while awaiting judgment,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the NoTW splashed another front page article concerning the events in question under the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">heading &#8220;MY NA I ORGY WITH FI BOSS&#8221;. Further, for reasons which to my mind could never</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">do them credit (whatever other justification might be advanced), the NoTW sent a copy of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the video to Formula 1 bosses, presumably in what transpired to be an unsuccessful attempt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to get Mr Mosley dismissed from his position.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref577" href="#footnote577">577</a></sup></span>

 In the light of behaviour of this sort,</span> it is not,<span style="font-weight:normal;"> perhaps, surprising thata number of witnesses
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gave evidence to the effect that they avoided litigation or complaints: it seems that many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">people in the public eye would rather endure breaches of privacy or small libels than conduct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">litigation, face the repetition of the offending story and endure the aggressive press response</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to me, &#8220;Do you &#8211;&#8221; When I was considering taking action against News International,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my publicists said to me, &#8220;Do you really want to make enemies of these people?&#8221; By</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">implication &#8211; well, the inference being that if &#8211; and when I asked them to elaborate,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they said, &#8220;Well, in the future if they decide to run another story, we can use it as a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bargaining chip. We can say that you could have taken legal action and you didn&#8217;t,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">therefore why don&#8217;t you drop the story?&#8221; But when they said &#8220;these people&#8221;, they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">meant that &#8211; the inference was clear, that if you make life difficult for them, they will</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">avoiding litigation and avoiding complaint except in the most serious circumstances, in order</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to avoid the aggressive and unpleasant response with which a complaint would be met. Ms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Church&#8217;s evidence indicated that aggressive attacks have a corollary: preferential treatment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for those who cooperate with newspapers. She recalled that when she was asked to sing at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s wedding in 1999, her manager was offered the choice between $100,000,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or no fee but favourable treatment in the NI press. Her manager advised her to accept no</span>

 The evidence asa whole highlighteda pointI made during the course of the Inquiry. The
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press are in a unique position as they carry a very large megaphone: if people cooperate,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that megaphone can be used to enhance careers; for those who complain or challenge titles,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the megaphone can be used to destroy them. Whereas complainants or litigants against</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual titles have a limited forum to air their complaints, the press have a ready and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">captive audience of hundreds of thousands if not millions of readers who will read their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">response. As a former NoTW news editor noted in an unguarded moment, the megaphone</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">frozen haddock, Mr Justice Eady hands down his views shorn of moral balance...&#8217;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref587" href="#footnote587">587</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> The</span><span style="font-style:normal"> key</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">point, it seems to me, is that if Mr Dacre and others had a strong objection to the development</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of protection of a right to privacy in UK law, they were perfectly entitled to express that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">objection in forceful terms. But by directing the rhetorical fire at an individual judge who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was seeking to apply the principles set down by higher courts and whose judgments were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">capable of challenge on appeal, that objection takes on the appearance of being aggressive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and intimidating. Furthermore, it was an attack to which, by judicial convention, Mr Justice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Eady was unable to respond.</span>

<p id="para-id-11-17"><a href="#para11-17" name="para11-17">11.17</a></p>
 Similarly intimidating and aggressive attacks have been directed at politicians who have
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criticised aspects of the press. Rather than engaging with the arguments made by the critics,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parts of the press have engaged in<span style="font-style:italic"> ad</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hominem</span> attacks. A prime example is the treatment of</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">critics of Page 3 who have been labelled variously as &#8220;fat&#8221;, &#8220;ugly&#8221; &#8220;harridan&#8221;, &#8220;battleaxe&#8221; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">&#8220;jealous of beautiful women&#8221;. Their arguments have been described as &#8220;potty&#8221;, &#8220;senseless&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">and &#8220;furious rants&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref588" href="#footnote588">588</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-11-18"><a href="#para11-18" name="para11-18">11.18</a></p>
 However, the preponderance of evidence suggests that overt intimidation of politicians
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the press is rare. What is far more widespread is a self-restraint by politicians fearful of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criticising the press. The evidence received from a number of politician witnesses indicated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that fear of press attack was a significant factor in the failure of successive Governments to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">tackle the issue of press behaviour, notwithstanding a recognition that better regulation was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">required. This is discussed in greater detail elsewhere, but for the purposes of this chapter it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">worth noting Lord Mandelson&#8217;s view that the Blair and Brown Governments were<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;cowed&#8217;</span> by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the power of the press and the threat of a hostile response to any attempts to address press</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref589" href="#footnote589">589</a></sup> The Rt Hon Ed Miliband agreed that fear played a significant part in the failure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to address press regulation during the Blair and Brown years.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref590" href="#footnote590">590</a></sup> When Mr Blair attempted to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">articulate his concerns about some aspects of the culture of the press in a speech delivered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prior to his departure from office,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref591" href="#footnote591">591</a></sup> the almost universally critical press response, including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a number of personally directed attacks, appeared to confirm those fears.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref592" href="#footnote592">592</a></sup> As Mr Paxman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">noted in his MacTaggart lecture in the same year:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref593" href="#footnote593">593</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;I thought the way we responded to Tony Blair&#8217;s speech was pretty pathetic. Again,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">let&#8217;s be frank. These two trades, politics and media have a great deal in common.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Both deal in words and images, both involve a contract with the public based upon</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fairly explicit promises&#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">By and large, the response to Blair&#8217;s attack just pressed the F12 key. Yah booh. You&#8217;re</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a politician. We&#8217;re media yahoos. Get over it.&#8221;</span>

 Assessed asa whole, it is appropriate to conclude from the evidence thata practice has
<span style="font-size: 15px;">existed within parts of the press, at certain times and in certain circumstances, of seeking to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intimidate or seek retribution against complainants and critics. While that approach may not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been widespread, it has been sufficiently prevalent to create a generalised fear amongst</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those in the public eye of criticising or challenging the press owing to concerns about personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attack and vilification. I repeat that the press is entitled to hold whatever opinions it wishes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, subject to defamation, is equally entitled to express them: it cannot complain, however,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if the inference is drawn that this practice is a form of special pleading and that the attack</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">follows a challenge to the way in which they go about their business.</span>

<h2>12. Complaints handling</h2>

<p id="para-id-12-1"><a href="#para12-1" name="para12-1">12.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An issue related to the way in which the press treats critics is the manner in which it deals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with those who make complaints in relation to specific stories. The Inquiry heard a great</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deal of evidence of good practice on this issue, in particular in relation to the use of readers&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editors at a number of titles. But there was also substantial evidence of poor practice,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">showing first, that the complaints process can be (sometimes, it was thought, deliberately)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protracted, complicated and expensive; second that there is a strong reluctance in parts of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press to apologise even when it is not in dispute that a story was incorrect; and third,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that apologies, retractions and corrections are frequently given substantially less prominence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than the offending article and therefore fail to satisfy those who are aggrieved. Although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence was heard on these issues from many witnesses, I focus only on three examples</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which I treat as case studies: the identity of the titles concerned is not to the point.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-2"><a href="#para12-2" name="para12-2">12.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first example was the response of a number of newspapers to complaints made by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the McCanns in light of defamatory reporting of the circumstances of their daughter&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disappearance.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref594" href="#footnote594">594</a></sup> Although some of the narrative has already been described,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref595" href="#footnote595">595</a></sup> it bears brief</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">repetition here. In September 2007, the McCanns&#8217; solicitor Angus McBride met with all the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editors of the national newspapers to convey the McCanns&#8217; concerns about the defamatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reporting of Madeleine&#8217;s disappearance and the harmful impact this reporting was having</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the search for her. That first meeting appeared to have no effect and, after continuing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">libellous reporting by a number of daily newspapers, further meetings were arranged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between Mr McBride, Clarence Mitchell and the editors responsible. Those further meetings</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also appeared to have no effect and the defamatory reporting continued. On 26 September</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2007, a solicitors&#8217; letter threatening libel proceedings was sent to those newspapers which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appeared to be the worst offenders. That letter, and a further letter sent on 10 October 2007,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appeared to have no impact on the continuing libellous reporting.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref596" href="#footnote596">596</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-12-3"><a href="#para12-3" name="para12-3">12.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In January 2008, the McCanns&#8217; representatives sent a formal letter before action in advance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a libel claim to both the Daily Express and the Daily Star newspapers. Notwithstanding the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fact that the newspapers were aware they had no clear factual basis for any of the libellous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories published,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref597" href="#footnote597">597</a></sup> the Express Group wrote that they were not willing to publish an apology</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the libels, but were willing to offer the McCanns a &#8220;platform&#8221; to tell their side of the story,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and offered them an exclusive interview and photo-shoot with OK! Magazine. Unsurprisingly,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the McCanns rejected the (astonishingly misjudged) offer. As Dr Gerry McCann wrote:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref598" href="#footnote598">598</a></sup></span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I found it simply breathtaking that they would think it appropriate to offer us</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interviews or other coverage in their own newspapers that they would subsequently</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">make money from, as an appropriate remedy for the distress and hurt they had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">caused.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-12-4"><a href="#para12-4" name="para12-4">12.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although the Express Group subsequently published what they described as an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;unprecedented&#8221; front page apology to the McCanns, that was not matched by their apology</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the friends of the McCanns who had also been falsely accused (on the front page) of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">covering up the truth about Madeleine&#8217;s disappearance: their apology in the Daily Express</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was found on page five.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-5"><a href="#para12-5" name="para12-5">12.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The McCanns also brought proceedings against Associated Newspapers Ltd (ANL), on the basis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of defamatory coverage in the Evening Standard and Daily Mail. The claim was settled with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a substantial payment to the Find Madeleine fund, and an apology in the Evening Standard.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Daily Mail offered the McCanns free advertising for the Find Madeleine fund, but refused</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to apologise essentially on the basis that the defamatory stories published by the title had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been balanced with a number of favourable reports about the McCanns. Unsurprisingly,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the McCanns were disappointed by the newspaper&#8217;s stance, but chose not to continue a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protracted dispute.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref599" href="#footnote599">599</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-12-6"><a href="#para12-6" name="para12-6">12.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second example of poor practice in responding to complaints is Neil Morrissey&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">experience of a complaint against the Daily Mail.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref600" href="#footnote600">600</a></sup> On 19 March 2011, the Daily Mail had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">published an article alleging that Mr Morrissey had been banned from a pub in France for</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">drunken and rowdy behaviour. The story was untrue, the Daily Mail had been told in advance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of publication that it was untrue, and the Daily Mail eventually accepted it was untrue and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apologised. But the process leading to that apology was unnecessarily protracted.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-7"><a href="#para12-7" name="para12-7">12.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 23 March 2011, immediately after publication, Mr Morrissey&#8217;s lawyers wrote to ANL</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stating that if an immediate apology and retraction were published, no claim for damages</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be issued. That letter and a subsequent one went unanswered for a month. ANL</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">eventually replied on 21 April 2011 refusing to publish an apology or retraction even though</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it appears that they did not claim in terms that the story was true, insisting instead that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story presented Mr Morrissey &#8220;in a sympathetic light&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-8"><a href="#para12-8" name="para12-8">12.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Morrissey issued a libel claim on 21 June 2011. A further six weeks passed before, on 5</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">August 2011, the Daily Mail accepted that the story was untrue and made an offer of amends.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although ANL claim that it was only then that it became clear that the story was untrue,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref601" href="#footnote601">601</a></sup> it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is difficult to understand why it took almost five months to reach this conclusion.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-9"><a href="#para12-9" name="para12-9">12.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Once the Daily Mail accepted its error, the parties entered negotiations to agree the format</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and placement of an apology. The original article was published on page 19, took up a full</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">page of the Daily Mail, was around 600 words long and included four large photographs. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Morrissey originally requested a 160 word apology under its own headline, but entered into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">negotiations with the Daily Mail over wording.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref602" href="#footnote602">602</a></sup> After six weeks of negotiations, the Daily</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">page 2.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref603" href="#footnote603">603</a></sup> Mr Morrissey complained that this apology did not have anything approaching the</span>

 The Inquiry heard evidence froma number of witnesses with regard to correction and
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clarification columns and their benefits and disadvantages. Although I accept that there are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significant benefits, a legitimate criticism that needs to be addressed is how to distinguish an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apology for defamation or breach of privacy from simple factual corrections or clarifications.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The apology to Mr Morrissey was published alongside a correction of the price paid by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NHS per loaf of gluten-free bread, and it seems reasonable in that context for Mr Morrissey</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to complain that the placement of the apology devalued it. In my view, an apology should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at least be headlined with &#8220;apology&#8221; or &#8220;sorry&#8221; or something to clearly mark it out as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">something distinct from a simple factual correction. In the absence of such a clear marker, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is unsurprising that some witnesses inferred that newspapers seek to bury their apologies.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-12"><a href="#para12-12" name="para12-12">12.12</a></p>
 Immediately after publication,</span> Carbon Brief wrote to the Daily Mail to identify the<span style="font-weight:normal;"> error, but

<span style="font-size: 15px;">received no response. A subsequent complaint to the PCC was defended by the Daily Mail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by reference to a 2008 report by the think-tank Civitas. However, that report did not in fact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">support the Daily Mail&#8217;s &#163;200 or 20% claim. Accordingly, the Daily Mail published a correction</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some three months after the claim had first appeared, and after it had been repeated many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">times in other titles.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref606" href="#footnote606">606</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-12-13"><a href="#para12-13" name="para12-13">12.13</a></p>
 That was not the end of the matter. Less than two weeks after the correction had been
<span style="font-size: 15px;">published, the 20% claim was repeated in the Mail on Sunday. Carbon Brief wrote to the Mail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on Sunday to identify the error but, once again, received no response. Carbon Brief therefore</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made a second complaint to the PCC. Pending the resolution of that complaint, and despite</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the fact the Mail on Sunday was aware of both the PCC complaint and the previous correction</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the Daily Mail, it published a further article making the same claim, saying that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> country</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is overrun with wind farms and energy costs are skyrocketing, with green stealth taxes adding</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">15 to 20 per cent to the average domestic power bill.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> The</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Mail</span><span style="font-style:normal"> on</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Sunday</span><span style="font-style:normal"> subsequently</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">published a correction, but then, two months later, once again repeated the claim.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref607" href="#footnote607">607</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-12-14"><a href="#para12-14" name="para12-14">12.14</a></p>

<p id="para-id-12-15"><a href="#para12-15" name="para12-15">12.15</a></p>
 To those bullet points might be addeda fifth point, namely that complaints to the PCC would
<span style="font-size: 15px;">never have been required had the titles replied to the original letters sent by Carbon Brief</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">direct to the newspapers. Accordingly, the example raises concerns about the ability, or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">willingness, of some newspaper titles to respond to complaints made direct to the newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by readers. Sensibly, most complaints should be resolved at that level without the need to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">refer a complaint to the regulatory body. But the Carbon Brief example suggests that, in some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cases, some newspapers ignore complaints entirely, or delay in responding for significant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">periods, until the regulator, or the courts, are involved.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-16"><a href="#para12-16" name="para12-16">12.16</a></p>
 The three examples above provide evidence of each of the three specific concerns raised by
<span style="font-size: 15px;">witnesses in relation to inadequate complaint handling by parts of the press: i) the delay and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expense of bringing a complaint, ii) the reluctance of parts of the press to apologise or correct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">errors, and iii) the failure to give due prominence to apologies and corrections.</span>

<h4>Unnecessary delay and over-complication of the complaints process</h4>

<p id="para-id-12-17"><a href="#para12-17" name="para12-17">12.17</a></p>
 Full Fact provided the Inquiry with evidence of all three issues. In relation to the delay
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occasioned by parts of the press when dealing with complaints, Full Fact suggested that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some newspapers deliberately complicate and draw out the complaints process as a tactic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to avoid making apologies and corrections. They wrote that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;little</span><span style="font-style:italic"> effort</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> made</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> part</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of newspapers to avoid making the process extremely awkward and time consuming for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">complainants&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref609" href="#footnote609">609</a></sup><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref610" href="#footnote610">610</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Will</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Moy</span><span style="font-style:normal"> spoke</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> their</span><span style="font-style:normal"> regular</span><span style="font-style:normal"> experience</span><span style="font-style:normal"> as</span><span style="font-style:normal"> follows:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref611" href="#footnote611">611</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Where the first offer you get is, &#8220;We&#8217;ll amend the headline online only&#8221;. Then you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">get the offer of &#8220;We&#8217;ll print a letter from Full Fact disagreeing with our article but we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">won&#8217;t change the article or admit there was anything wrong with it&#8221;. Then you get</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">page 12, then you get page 6, then you get page 4, then you get page 2. All of this,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rounds and rounds of correspondence, weeks between them, takes forever, deeply</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">tiring. And all of this, of course, after the actual inaccuracy has been accepted.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-12-18"><a href="#para12-18" name="para12-18">12.18</a></p>
A specific example of apparently deliberate awkwardness was Full Fact&#8217;s evidence that on
<span style="font-size: 15px;">three occasions, after a long process of negotiating agreed corrections, and after having</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reached agreement, the Daily Mail had contacted the PCC to seek changes to the agreement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the night before publication. The organisation noted:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref612" href="#footnote612">612</a></sup></span>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref610" name="footnote610" title="Go back to footnote reference 610 in the text">610</a>.  Mr Moy overstates the position in suggesting that this is standard practice within newspapers. The Inquiry hasreceived much evidence to contrary effect: see, for example, the decision of the Court of Appeal in<span style="font-style:italic"> KC<span style="font-style:italic"> v</span><span style="font-style:italic"> MGN</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Ltd</span></span></p><!--footnote-->

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;This means unilaterally reopening the complaints process on an evening before</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">publication, when complainants may not be in a position to respond immediately.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Indeed, this means demanding a response time from the complainant that we never</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">receive from newspapers themselves.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">That this has been done on three separate occasions over four complaints to our</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">knowledge, all by the same newspaper and not just to Full Fact, gives such moves the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">impression of a considered tactic to disrupt the process.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-12-19"><a href="#para12-19" name="para12-19">12.19</a></p>
 Although it is not necessary to reacha conclusion as to whether the Daily Mail&#8217;s approach
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the three occasions cited was part of a deliberate tactic, the simple fact is that it is part</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a general tendency within parts of the press to delay and complicate what ought to be a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasonably simple process of prompt correction and apology. Mr Snow gave evidence of what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he considered was unnecessary argument with ANL over the precise format of an apology to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be published after he had been defamed. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref613" href="#footnote613">613</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The confession was that it was completely untrue and they accepted it was untrue</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and they retracted it and apologised. The apology was 1.5 inches by a column and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">then the wrestling was over whether there should be a photograph of me above it.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">They didn&#8217;t want the photograph because that would draw attention to the apology.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Actually, in the end, we got the photograph, but I mean, this is pathetic. Wrestling</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">over 1.5 inches when you have had five pages of something which the paper itself</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deems untrue? That is not the way forward&#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">That is the process we have at the moment. That is justice; that is the way any reader</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who &#8211; or any person offended by a paper who has something wrong gets redress.&#8221;</span>

<h4>Reluctance to publish corrections and/or apologies, even where error is clear</h4>

<p id="para-id-12-20"><a href="#para12-20" name="para12-20">12.20</a></p>
 In relation toa reluctance within some titles to publish apologies and/or</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> corrections, Full
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Fact&#8217;s &#8216;churnalism&#8217; project was instructive.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref614" href="#footnote614">614</a></sup> Along with Mr Atkins, Full Fact published a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of fictional press releases that were adopted and published by newspapers without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficient checking. One, published in the Metro, told of a fictional stammerer who had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decided to undergo unorthodox speech therapy to cure his stammer in time for Valentine&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Day. Another, published by the Daily Mail on the basis of a Facebook page, reported claims</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the Prime Minister&#8217;s new cat was actually stolen from a council estate in South London.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Full Fact informed the newspapers that they had published hoax stories but both refused to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publish corrections or clarifications, despite extensive correspondence. Full Fact noted:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref615" href="#footnote615">615</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; it once again raises the question of why newspapers are so adversarial on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">issue of acknowledging errors at all. It is extremely rare for us to submit a complaint</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about a significant factual inaccuracy that is not initially dismissed by the paper.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Even in cases where papers have been indisputably wrong (such as over a basic error</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">leading to stories reporting life expectancy on a Merthyr Tydfil estate was lower than</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in Haiti) several rounds of correspondence over several weeks have been required to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">get a worthwhile correction printed.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref613" name="footnote613" title="Go back to footnote reference 613 in the text">613</a>.  pp26-28, lines 4-5, Jon Snow, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-25-June-2012.pdf</p><!--footnote-->

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">One of the problems at the heart the issue is not that papers get their facts wrong or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">indeed borrow heavily from press releases, but an unwillingness to acknowledge and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">act on the problems that may arise as a consequence.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Given the time and resource pressures in the media it is inevitable that mistakes get</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">made, so why not be more willing to acknowledge and correct them when they are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pointed out?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Perhaps it would make the embarrassment from these kind of hoaxes a little easier</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to swallow.&#8221;</span>
<h4>Lack of due prominence</h4>

<p id="para-id-12-21"><a href="#para12-21" name="para12-21">12.21</a></p>
 The identification ofa reluctance to publish apologies and/or corrections feeds into the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">third issue identified: lack of due prominence when an apology or correction is made. Full</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Fact<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref616" href="#footnote616">616</a></sup> and the Media Standards Trust<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref617" href="#footnote617">617</a></sup> gave evidence on this point. Considered together</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their evidence suggests that it is extremely difficult to find any adjudications, apologies or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">corrections that are given equal prominence as the offending article. It is of course correct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that &#8220;equal prominence&#8221; is not what is required by the Editors&#8217; Code, but it is also clear that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what parts of the press consider to be &#8220;due prominence&#8221; is not the same as what victims of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inaccuracies, defamations and breaches of privacy consider it to be.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-22"><a href="#para12-22" name="para12-22">12.22</a></p>
 Ms Mills,</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref618" href="#footnote618">618</a></sup></span> Ms Gascoigne,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref619" href="#footnote619">619</a></sup></span> Ms Miller,<span style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 9px;"> 620</span> Mr Coogan,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref621" href="#footnote621">621</a></sup></span> Mr Snow<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref622" href="#footnote622">622</a></sup></span> and Ms Diamond<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref623" href="#footnote623">623</a></sup> all
<span style="font-size: 15px;">spoke of the insufficient prominence with which apologies were published after complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of breach of privacy or libel. They were consistent in complaining that corrections or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apologies were nowhere near as prominent as offending articles and noted that the damage</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to reputation or privacy caused by a front page splash, or full page article, could not be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remedied by the publication of a two inch apology within a corrections and clarifications</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">column, or elsewhere in the newspaper.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">may be so, but if Mr Mohan was claiming the publication of this particular adjudication as an</span>

<p id="para-id-12-24"><a href="#para12-24" name="para12-24">12.24</a></p>
 Mr Blair&#8217;s evidence indicated the potential importance of due prominence in correcting errors
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in political reporting. He recalled the front page vehemence with which parts of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had attacked Lord Mandelson&#8217;s alleged lies in relation to the Hinduja passport scandal and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compared that vehemence to the relative lack of publicity given to the subsequent official</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">report which cleared Lord Mandelson of any wrongdoing.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref627" href="#footnote627">627</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-12-25"><a href="#para12-25" name="para12-25">12.25</a></p>
 Although some editors and journalists resisted the suggestion that apologies and corrections
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were &#8220;buried&#8221; within newspapers, a number accepted that there was at least a perception</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this was the case. Rebekah Brooks noted that, in her experience,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;correcting</span><span style="font-style:italic"> inaccuracies</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">does not cost a great deal for the press, but it is given low priority and minimal projection&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> and</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">she accepted that the NI newspapers were as much at fault for this as others.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref628" href="#footnote628">628</a></sup> She said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref629" href="#footnote629">629</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;one of the biggest complaints I used to get, not necessarily about my own newspaper</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but about the press in general, was the prominence of apologies when an inaccuracy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had taken place&#8230; The page 37, one paragraph type thing.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-12-26"><a href="#para12-26" name="para12-26">12.26</a></p>
 In light of Mrs Brooks&#8217;</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> evidence, it was somewhat ironic that James Murdoch complained of
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a lack of prominence of apologies in articles concerning NI. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref630" href="#footnote630">630</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Look, I think it&#8217;s &#8211; you know, I have personal opinions about this, and actually, as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the subject of a lot of press coverage over the last year myself, to be honest, I&#8217;ve</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had cause for reflection, and I have been concerned with things like the ability to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">make a case, the ability to reply. I have been concerned with things like prominence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of corrections. The Guardian alone I think has had to correct stories about News</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Corporation over 40 times in the last ten months or so, none of which seemed to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have the same prominence as the original story, and that worries me. I think clearly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it shows that somewhere in that code strengthening needs to occur with respect to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">accuracy and creating accountability there, but you know, I think this is going to be a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">matter for this Inquiry and for the industry.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-12-27"><a href="#para12-27" name="para12-27">12.27</a></p>
 Former PCC Chairman Sir Christopher Meyer acknowledged that during his tenure between
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2003-2007 there was a problem ensuring that corrections and apologies were given due</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prominence; his view was that the problem remained today. In large part, he accepted that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the problem lay with the fact that the PCC had no power to direct where corrections and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apologies should appear, and no power to direct their size and prominence.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref631" href="#footnote631">631</a></sup></span>

 <h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p id="para-id-12-28"><a href="#para12-28" name="para12-28">12.28</a></p>
 Looking at the evidence in the round, it appears that parts of the press have adopted an
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adversarial approach to complaints, whereby even when clear errors have been identified,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there has been a failure to provide swift and complete remedies to complainants. Plainly,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there are common themes here with the section of the Report addressed to the treatment of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">critics [see section 11 above]. Parts of the press have, at times, sought to avoid corrections and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apologies and have sought to minimise the prominence of those corrections and apologies.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I agree with Sir Christopher Meyer that any new regulator must address this issue and must</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have the power to order editors where, when, and how they should publish apologies,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">retractions, corrections and/or adjudications.</span>
