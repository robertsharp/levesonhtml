<h1>CHAPTER 3<br/>COMPLAINTS OF AN UNETHICAL PRESS</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Overview</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As a prelude to the more detailed assessment and treatment of the evidence set out below,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this Part of the Report will summarise, with little weighing or assessment, the complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voiced during Module One of the Inquiry of an unethical press. As cannot be over-emphasised,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the criticisms are not of every title or every journalist, or even anything like every title or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">every journalist. The great majority of both perform their work admirably, ethically and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with scrupulous attention to detail. The purpose of the Inquiry, however, was to address</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the practices of those who do not and any culture that is based on the latter rather than the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">former. Accordingly, references to unethical or unlawful practices of &#8220;the press&#8221; must be read</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as referring to such practices within &#8220;parts of the press&#8221;. It should be noted, however, that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although some stories in the regional press have been the subject of criticism, the generic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns are not directed to the regional press.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">TheinitialwaveofevidencereceivedbytheInquiryfromitsfirst21witnesses,overfiveworking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">days between 21 November and 28 November 2011, undoubtedly made an immediate and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">powerful impact within the Inquiry room and beyond. All those who spoke volunteered to do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so; more have complained and some of the further statements have been put into the record</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Inquiry. Access to this evidence by the vast majority of the public has been through</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry&#8217;s website which remains available to anyone who wishes to view or review this</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">testimony: everyone therefore has the opportunity to test the Inquiry&#8217;s assessments and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusions against this evidence base if so minded.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This Chapter summarises the thematic trends which emerged in the evidence given by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">victims of unethical press practices in the first 5 days of the inquiry. But before beginning to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examine these trends, it is possible to take a wider perspective. Complaints of an unethical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press are of considerable lineage and are not confined to the United Kingdom. Of perhaps</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">even greater relevance for present purposes is not so much the bare fact that such complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been made but rather the contemporary chord they often strike. For example, the great</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">American jurists, Warren and Brandeis, writing in the Harvard Law Review in 1890 said this:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The press is overstepping in every direction the obvious bounds of propriety and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decency. Gossip is no longer the resource of the idle and of the vicious, but has become</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a trade, which is pursued with industry as well as effrontery. To satisfy a prurient</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">taste the details of sexual relations are spread broadcast in the columns of the daily</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">papers. To occupy the indolent, column upon column is filled with idle gossip, which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">can only be procured by intrusion upon the domestic circle...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The reference to the need to satisfy a prurient taste hints at the commercial pressures</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operating on the press as long ago as 1890. More recently, Sir John Major writing at the very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">end of the twentieth century put the point somewhat differently:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Across Fleet Street, sensational and exclusive stories sold extra copies &#8211; straight</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reporting did not. Accuracy suffered, squandered for something, anything, &#8216;new&#8217;.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Quotes were reconstructed, leaks and splashes abounded, confidentiality was not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">respected and reputations sacrificed for a few days&#8217; hysterical splash.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">At a perhaps higher level of generality, in mitigating his client&#8217;s case on his behalf at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sentencing hearing which took place on 26 January 2007, defence counsel for Clive Goodman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Mr Goodman has lived his life in a world where, and I say this with some trepidation,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ethical lines are not always clearly defined, or at least observed...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Defence counsel was no doubt speaking on instructions when he made this submission.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Regardless of the trepidation apparently evinced, the point counsel was making was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intended to be revelatory; rather, he was seeking to remind the judge that his client was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operating within a wider press culture which did not always encourage best practice. It is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unlikely that &#8216;the world&#8217; he was referring to was confined to the microcosm of the News of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the World (NoTW): it was intended as a wider metaphor comprising the press as a whole, or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the very least a section of it.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his closing arguments on behalf of Northern & Shell, James Dingemans QC submitted, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the context of his succinct analysis of the culture, practices and ethics of the press, that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;... [f]ourthly, the evidence shows that they have a tendency to see news as divorced</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from the individuals involved. Fifthly, in some areas, there has been shown a stunning</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">lack of judgment to the extent that it might engage the criminal law, and I say no more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about that; about where lines can properly be drawn between the public interest in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">acquiring news and privacy&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 30px; color:#ffffff">f</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his closing remarks, Rhodri Davies QC on behalf of News International arguably went</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">slightly further:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Going on to the evidence heard in Module 1, there is no doubt that that made out</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the case that all has not been well with the press...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, when asked for his assessment of the evidence the Inquiry received during Module</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One, Rt Hon Michael Gove MP, Secretary of State for Education recognised that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence disclosed a problem which was capable of being regarded as &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic"> serious</span> &#8217;,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> although he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proceeded to observe that the cure might be worse than the disease. This, of course, raises a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">separate matter which will be relevant when discussing what &#8216;the cure&#8217; might be. For present</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">purposes it is sufficient to record that a wide range of witnesses, commentators, observers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and interested parties have stated or opined that not all is well in the state of the culture,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and ethics of the press: the complaints cannot be dismissed, as parts of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have sought to do, as the whining of a few disgruntled celebrities.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-10"><a href="#para1-10" name="para1-10">1.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The ground having being set, a thumb-nail sketch of the complaints of unacceptable press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice will now be set out under thematic sub-headings, recognising always a considerable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">element of overlap between many of these.</span>

<h2>2. The complaints</h2>

<h3>Failing to respect individual privacy and dignity</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An overarching complaint which encompasses many of the individual cases set out below</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is that the press has failed always to treat individuals with common decency, and has failed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">always to respect individual privacy. This encompasses many of the unethical techniques</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complained of, including phone hacking, surveillance, blagging and harassment. It is also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exemplified by complaints relating to the publication of private and/or sensitive material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">without any public interest justification, and the intrusion into grief or shock. Three of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;case studies&#8217; examined below<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> are prime examples of this tendency: the way in which parts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press treated the Dowlers, the McCanns, and Christopher Jefferies indicates a press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indifferent to individual privacy and casual in its approach to truth, even when the stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were potentially extremely damaging for the individuals involved.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">FurtherevidencerelevanttothiscomplaintincludedSiennaMiller&#8217;scomplaintsofharassment,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the intrusion into the private grief of Anne Diamond and Baroness Hollins. Further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence suggesting that parts of the press have failed to respect individual dignity and privacy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were the examples seen by the Inquiry of the access and publication of sensitive personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information, including medical information, without any or any adequate consideration of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the rights of, and effects on, the person in question and his or her family. Examples included</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the publication of confidential medical information relating to one of Gordon Brown MP&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">children in 2006, and the publication of extracts of the Kate McCann diaries in the NoTW in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2008: these are both the subject of detailed analysis below.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The key issues to be considered under this heading are whether practices existed within the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press consistent with an unethical culture of seeing individuals (and celebrities in particular)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as objects, that is to say, simply as material for a story; whether there was an unethical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cultural indifference to the consequences of exposing private lives; and, whether there was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an unethical cultural indifference to the public interest in exposing private lives, exemplified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by failures to put in place adequate procedures to ensure that potentially relevant public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest considerations were addressed and recorded.</span>

<h3>Unlawful or unethical acquisition of private information</h3>
<h4>Phone hacking</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of witnesses have alleged that they were the victims of phone hacking, in all but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one case at the hands of a private investigator engaged, and perhaps journalists employed,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the NoTW.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> Much of the supporting evidence is derived from the notebooks of the private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, currently the subject of detailed review by the officers involved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in Operation Weeting. Additionally, reliance may safely be placed for present purposes on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">admissions and settlements made by News Group Newspapers in the civil proceedings and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acknowledgements that such actions were unacceptable and wrong made by representatives</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of that company, News International, and News Corporation before the Culture, Media and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sport Select Committee and the Inquiry itself.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref7" name="footnote7" title="Go back to footnote reference 7 in the text">7</a>.  Part F, Chapter 5</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref8" name="footnote8" title="Go back to footnote reference 8 in the text">8</a>.  See the evidence of Charlotte Church, Sally and Bob Dowler, Mary-Ellen Field, Hugh Grant and Sienna Miller</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page473"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Notwithstanding the number of arrests which have been made to date,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> it is still not clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">just how widespread the practice of phone hacking was, or the extent to which it may have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extended beyond one title; and, in the light of the limitations which necessarily impact on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this aspect of the Inquiry because of the ongoing investigation and impending prosecutions,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is simply not possible to be definitive. The evidence of Paul McMullan, Sharon Marshall and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">James Hipwell points to phone hacking being a common and known practice at the NoTW</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and elsewhere. In relation to other titles, the degree of knowledge, acquiescence and turning</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the metaphorical blind eye may be difficult to assess quantitatively on the basis of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence the Inquiry has received (although a fuller analysis of this issue will be conducted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">below);<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> in qualitative terms, however, valuable evidence was obtained from witnesses such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as Piers Morgan, Heather Mills, Jeremy Paxman and Dominic Mohan.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) contains no defence of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acting in the public interest, the Inquiry has examined the extent to which it could be argued</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the hacking of voicemails was carried out in pursuit of stories which could properly and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fairly be characterised as being in the public interest. There is no evidence that this is so: to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such extent as the evidence has been ventilated, the hacking of voicemails was systematically</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deployed to garner pieces of gossip and tittle-tattle about the lives of celebrities and those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">otherwise in the public eye whether as victims of crime, politicians or potential sources for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories; in other words, to intrude into their privacy without any conceivable justification</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that could truly be argued to be in the public interest. Whereas in other contexts it has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argued by the press, or sections of the press, that there is a public interest in freedom of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">speech itself, and that an editor should be permitted to decide where the ethical balance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">falls, no such argument has been aired in this particular context.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 30px; color:#ffffff">f</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Put at its very lowest, the Inquiry will need to consider whether, at least until 2006, there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">existed a culture within the press of indifference to the unlawfulness of the practice of phone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking (or a lack of understanding of its unlawfulness, which itself is difficult to justify) and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to its unethical nature. It will also be necessary to consider whether the evidence received is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficient to reach conclusions in respect of the use of phone hacking at titles other than the</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">NoTW.</span>
<h4>Blagging</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Aside from the evidence generated by Operation Motorman,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup> a number of witnesses told</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry how their privacy had been breached in contravention of the Editors&#8217; Code and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also potentially section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998, through the technique known</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as blagging. A flavour of this evidence may be given by furnishing a number of examples. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her witness statement<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup> JK Rowling stated that, during the course of 1998, she received a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">telephone call purportedly from the Post Office. The caller explained that they had a package</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the Post Office wanted to deliver but that they did not have Ms Rowling&#8217;s address. On</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the face of it, this was a remarkable claim and, on being pressed to justify it by Ms Rowling,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the caller swiftly hung up. It is difficult to avoid the inference that this was a journalist</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seeking personal information. Ms Rowling&#8217;s husband-to-be appears to have received similar</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">treatment by the press in 2000.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup> He was telephoned by a person claiming to be from the tax</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">office seeking information regarding his address and earnings, and this was duly disclosed.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalist is here even stronger.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Overall, and in a similar manner to phone hacking, the Inquiry will need to consider whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was a culture of indifference within the press as to the lawfulness of blagging (or a lack</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of understanding as to its unlawfulness), and to its unethical nature.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">current status it is difficult to reach any conclusions of a generic nature in relation to email</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of 31 October 2012 (Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers&#8217; fourth witness statement) a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">total of 52 individuals had been arrested by officers working on Operation Elveden; of these,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">27 were current and former journalists (including journalists from The Sun; the Daily Mirror</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and its sister paper, the Sunday Mirror<span style="font-style:italic"> ;</span> and the Daily Star Sunday).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup> In an important piece of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence, DAC Akers pointed out that offences of this nature were suspected to have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">committed in at least three separate newspaper groups right up to early 2012.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The fact that these arrests have occurred does not of course prove that an unlawful and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unethical practice existed within the press of inducing, or seeking to induce, public officials to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disclose confidential information about individuals or organisations; given the test required</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to justify arrest in the first place, it merely raises reasonable grounds to suspect that various</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offences may have been committed. Further, the ongoing criminal investigation hampers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ability of the Inquiry to explore the available evidence. Recognising these constraining</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">factors, these developments cannot be dismissed as irrelevant.</span>

<a name="page475"></a><!--new page--><h4>Surveillance, subterfuge and similar intrusive methods</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-14"><a href="#para2-14" name="para2-14">2.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of witnesses, as well as those contributing submissions on the Inquiry website,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have described the use of covert surveillance or intrusive subterfuge by journalists or their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent contractors as a means of uncovering stories. This testimony covers a range of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different techniques: by way of example, the deployment of private detectives to carry out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what might be described as traditional surveillance of subjects; the recording of telephone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conversations with subjects, sometimes coupled with the giving of assurances which are not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">kept; and the use of long-lens photography. At the very least, the issue arises of whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists give any, or any adequate, consideration to such surveillance being likely to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generate relevant information in the public interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence of journalists Sharon Marshall and Paul McMullan, which appeared to confirm</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the widespread use of such techniques by parts of the press, must be treated with a degree</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of caution. But it must also be considered in light of other evidence heard by the Inquiry. That</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence included the logbooks of private investigators Derek Webb<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup> and Matt Sprake<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup> which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">showed newspaper titles having commissioned covert and sometimes extended surveillance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on hundreds of individuals, most of them so called celebrities, over a number of years. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sprake&#8217;s evidence that ethical questions were for the newspapers which commissioned his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">work rather than for him emphasised the importance of newspaper oversight of third parties.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-16"><a href="#para2-16" name="para2-16">2.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Evidence from &#8216;targets&#8217; of intrusive press techniques also supported the evidence of Ms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Marshall and Mr McMullan. The inquiry heard of the gross intrusions into the privacy of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lawyers Charlotte Harris and Mark Lewis by News International. It also heard of the paranoia</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">caused by the surveillance on, and/or threats received by, politicians Tom Watson MP and</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 30px; color:#ffffff">f</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chris Bryant MP. Other witnesses, including Steve Coogan, gave evidence of the use by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press of duplicity and subterfuge to acquire stories that could not possibly be justified by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-17"><a href="#para2-17" name="para2-17">2.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Report will need to consider the extent to which these practices and others were sporadic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and limited or widespread and/or cultural within parts of the press.</span>

<h3>Unlawful or unethical treatment of individuals</h3>
<h4>Harassment</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-18"><a href="#para2-18" name="para2-18">2.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of witnesses testified to a range of practices, including the use of intrusive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photography, pursuit by photographers whether on foot or in vehicles, &#8216;door-stepping&#8217; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;staking out&#8217;. Here again the Inquiry will need to consider whether a culture existed within the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press, or a section of the press, which encouraged or condoned these practices; or, insofar</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as these practices were perpetrated by independent contractors, which failed to ensure that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficient steps were taken to ascertain whether information, photographs and data were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acquired in a context in which an individual was subject to harassment.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-19"><a href="#para2-19" name="para2-19">2.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Amongst the most cogent evidence of harassment of this nature was that given by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">actress Sienna Miller. She gave a powerful account of acts of dangerous driving, and of being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">harassed, verbally abused and spat at by freelance photographers, until, that is, a court order</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protected her from such conduct in the future:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to secure a story; common practices included the aggressive door-stepping of individuals. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one notable instance she described her efforts to door-step the broadcast journalist, Jeremy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Paxman, by putting the same question to him 14 times,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup> in an attempt to report on rumours</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of an extramarital affair.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup> She described other occasions in which, whilst in pursuit of a story,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">attempts to obtain a quote or break a story.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of &#8216;top-spin&#8217;) record a pattern of behaviour which is also described by a number of witnesses.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Miller, Sheryl Gascoigne and the McCanns gave consistent evidence of high-speed car</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">chases by journalists and press photographers. Ms Gascoigne explained how, following</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her marriage to the footballer Paul Gascoigne, she was subjected to intense press scrutiny</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that sought to depict her as a money grabber and the cause of her husband&#8217;s issues with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">addiction and mental illness. This scrutiny went beyond coverage of her public appearances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and extended to the sustained harassment of her in and around her home. At times it took</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extraordinary forms. One journalist followed Ms Gascoigne and her children from their home</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in Hertfordshire to the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">minorities, in particular by demonstrating and fostering prejudice, unfairness and lack of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The point has already been made above<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup> that it is in the nature of journalism that mistakes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will be made: indeed, that is an unavoidable aspect of human nature itself. Deliberate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">falsification (or reckless reporting) of material and evidence is, of course, another matter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">altogether. The Inquiry will need to determine whether culture and practices exist within the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press which fall short of the standards of accuracy which can reasonably be expected to be in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public interest. As part and parcel of this overall assessment, consideration will need to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be given to whether, in particular, insufficient standards of care have been applied to avoiding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the publication of inaccurate, misleading or distorted information, including pictures; and of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether misleading or inaccurate headlines have been deployed, knowingly or otherwise,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with a view to attracting purchases.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-29"><a href="#para2-29" name="para2-29">2.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Justice cannot be done to all the multifarious complaints of inaccuracy which the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">received. Instead, for present purposes the focus will be on the evidence of a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists. Both Richard Peppiatt and Sharon Marshall pointed to a propensity in some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parts of the press towards a form of lazy journalism where quotes were made up to back a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular line in a story,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup> or where entire stories were built around fabricated quotations.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref38" href="#footnote38">38</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both were also clear that in the newsrooms in which they worked this practice was neither</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">limited to a small number of journalists nor deprecated. Rather, the practice was widespread,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">managers were aware of it and even offered cash incentives to staff.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref39" href="#footnote39">39</a></sup> It should be noted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this evidence has been strenuously denied by the papers concerned and that its quality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wholly depends on the assessment the Inquiry makes as to their credibility and reliability as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">witnesses.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-30"><a href="#para2-30" name="para2-30">2.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Similar evidence was provided to the Inquiry by Chris Atkins, the director of<span style="font-style:italic"> Starsuckers</span> , a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">documentary on the willingness of tabloid newspapers to run stories supplied by third parties</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">with little or no basis in truth. Mr Atkins described supplying one newspaper with a fabricated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story about a particular celebrity&#8217;s hair catching on fire at a party. In addition to running the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story without making due efforts to check its authenticity, the paper further embellished the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story by inventing a pithy conclusion: the paper wrote that another person at the party had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">put the fire out by punching the woman in her &#8216;barnet&#8217;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-31"><a href="#para2-31" name="para2-31">2.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Evidence of falsification and inaccuracy presented to the Inquiry goes beyond the fabrication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of single or even small numbers of facts associated with a story or with a witness. Hugh Grant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gave evidence about the publication in the Sunday Express of an entire article supposedly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">written by him; in fact, he had had nothing to do with it.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-32"><a href="#para2-32" name="para2-32">2.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In a revealing exchange with Robert Jay QC, Dawn Neesom, the editor of the Daily Star, said</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. There might be a kernel of truth in the story, but in order to make it more appetising</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and entertaining to its readers, which obviously you are plugged into &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes, of course.</span>

<a name="page479"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. you spin, embroider and weave around the edges of the story. Does that happen?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. It&#8217;s &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t quite put it in those words, but as I say, it&#8217;s written in a style that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we know works for our readers.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-33"><a href="#para2-33" name="para2-33">2.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On a separate but related topic, a considerable number of witnesses and commentators have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complained about the use of misleading and inaccurate headlines, often it seems knowingly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">used in order to attract custom. By way of example only, a number of such instances were put</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Ms Neesom,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup> and at least in one case she deployed the somewhat euphemistic adjectives</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">&#8216;dramatic&#8217; and &#8216;eye-catching&#8217; to characterise the inaccurate headline used. She also accepted</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">in this context, and perhaps in others, that newspapers do on occasion &#8216;cross lines&#8217;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-34"><a href="#para2-34" name="para2-34">2.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As with all these complaints of unethical conduct, an assessment will need to be made below<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as to whether this particular problem is sporadic on the one hand or illustrative of a cultural</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strand within press practice on the other.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-35"><a href="#para2-35" name="para2-35">2.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Aside from these complaints of inaccuracy, the Inquiry has also received a body of evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which, on analysis, may be characterised as amounting to a generic complaint of it being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">difficult, if not impossible, for readers to assess for themselves the evidential basis for what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is apparently being put forward as fact. This evidence may be categorised as follows: that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there has been an insufficiently clear distinction between comment, conjecture and fact, as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">required by clause 1 of the Editors&#8217; Code; that insufficient information has been provided</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to the sources of material published, on occasion giving rise to the suspicion if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not the inference that the source did not exist; and, that insufficient care has been taken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to the special public interest in the understanding of material relating to public</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 30px; color:#ffffff">f</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">health, medical and other scientific matters.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-36"><a href="#para2-36" name="para2-36">2.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is fully understood that each of these three categories gives rise to its own set of problems.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Newspapers are, of course, entitled to speculate and to offer their own opinions, and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">definition of what is &#8216;fact&#8217; is capable of being controversial, depending on the context.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, as a number of Core Participants have pointed out, with reference to legal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">authority, the distinction between fact and opinion in the specific context of the law of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">defamation is itself one of judgment: each does not require a separate, self-contained article</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or section of the newspaper, provided that it is reasonably clear to the reader from the tone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and language used which is which. However, the complaint that has frequently been made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is that, even with this element of latitude, fact and opinion are often so co-mingled that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reader is misled. Clause 1 of the Editors&#8217; Code correctly recognises the importance of this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">distinction, particularly in circumstances where the reader is placing trust in the newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a reliable purveyor of news as fact. Many have complained that clause 1 is more honoured</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the breach than in the observance, and the validity and strength of this complaint will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">therefore need to be assessed.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-37"><a href="#para2-37" name="para2-37">2.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The issue of journalistic sources is more controversial, not least because clause 10 of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Editors&#8217; Code places a moral obligation on journalists to protect their confidential sources.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If this obligation were to be interpreted as being<span style="font-style:italic"> absolute</span> , in the sense of being incapable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of yielding to countervailing public interest considerations, then clause 10 itself would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exceptionable as going further than the protections accorded to journalists under Article 10</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the ECHR and the law of contempt. In any event, there is a wider concern here, namely that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists may not always act ethically when invoking what protections they should properly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enjoy. The evidence heard from Richard Peppiatt, Alastair Campbell, Hugh Grant and Magnus</span>

<a name="page480"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">Boyd raised the strong suspicion, even if it did not provide conclusive evidence, that some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists habitually refer to &#8216;sources&#8217; even where the latter do not exist or where they have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">never said that which is attributed to them. But readers will never know where the truth lies,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and will never acquire the means of finding out, because abuses of the system are extremely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">difficult to prove. The anonymous source (and one who truly requires anonymity as the price</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for giving up the story) can of course be an extremely valuable tool in the hands of the ethical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and scrupulous journalist, but the possibilities for abuse are legion. An assessment will need</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be made as to the extent to which the important principle of the anonymous source is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">abused, even if there is no obvious solution to that abuse.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-38"><a href="#para2-38" name="para2-38">2.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The third category of complaint under this rubric is one articulated by a number of special</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest groups in relation to scientific, medical and public health reporting: not simply is the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern one of inaccuracy, it also covers a failure to provide sufficient information to facilitate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public understanding of what can often be complex and multi-faceted issues, where there may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be no &#8216;right&#8217; answer. The complaint has been variously expressed: as one of imbalance; or one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of unreliability; and, in clear-cut instances, as one of frank inaccuracy. Again, it is appreciated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that complex issues have to be set out in a manner comprehensible to readers, and that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers often succeed in distilling and presenting these in an admirably user-friendly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fashion. The issue which arises, though, is whether there exists a strand of unacceptable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice within the press which needs to be recognised and addressed.</span>

<h3>Treatment of critics and complainants</h3>
<h4>General discouragement of public criticism</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-39"><a href="#para2-39" name="para2-39">2.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Numerous individuals in public life have complained in evidence to the Inquiry that they</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been afraid or unwilling to confront the power of the press, or &#8211; putting the matter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">another way, failings in the culture, practices and ethics of the press &#8211; owing to concerns</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about personal attack and vilification. The issue for consideration is not whether these fears</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are honestly held (given the weight of convergent evidence, this could not seriously be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disputed) but rather whether the press has by its conduct caused, fostered or permitted such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an &#8216;atmosphere&#8217; to exist and be perpetuated whereby such fears have naturally spread.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-40"><a href="#para2-40" name="para2-40">2.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The corpus of evidence relevant to this issue is vast, but for present purposes it can be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered in three parts. First, the Inquiry heard evidence of overt intimidation of those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who had criticised the press. For example, after writing critical articles about the Daily Star in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular, and the tabloid press in general, Richard Peppiatt received threatening phone calls</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and text messages saying that he was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> marked</span><span style="font-style:italic"> man</span><span style="font-style:italic"> until</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> day</span><span style="font-style:italic"> you</span><span style="font-style:italic"> die&#8221;.</span> Similarly, while</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Hugh Grant was criticising tabloid press ethics while appearing on Question Time, the mother</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of his child was called and told to<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Tell</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Hugh</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Grant</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> shut</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> fuck</span><span style="font-style:italic"> up&#8221;</span> .</span>

<p id="para-id-2-41"><a href="#para2-41" name="para2-41">2.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, a significant number of the witnesses who testified during the first two weeks of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Module One gave evidence of their fears of, or actual retaliation, by the press in response to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints. JK Rowling made the point very compellingly in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I would like to emphasise that what I&#8217;m about to say does not apply to the whole of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the British press, but it is my experience with certain sectors of the British press. If you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">lock horns with them in this way, if you protest or you make a complaint, then you can</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expect some form of retribution fairly quickly, and I thought the fact that in this case</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a picture of my child was put into the papers, so very quickly after I&#8217;d asked them not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to print my address, I thought that was spiteful, actually. Just spiteful.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Her experience was consistent with a body of evidence received by the Inquiry suggesting that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a practice has existed within the press of obtaining or publishing material about individuals or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisations with whom they have been in dispute or disagreement, in circumstances where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is legitimate to conclude that the aim was to &#8216;pay back&#8217; or &#8216;punish&#8217; for the disagreement by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">causing distress, embarrassment or discomfort, rather than because the article had a public</span>

<p id="para-id-2-43"><a href="#para2-43" name="para2-43">2.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Two possible examples of this practice may be provided at this stage although each will be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discussed in greater detail below.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup> The first concerns what may be described as &#8216;real-time&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence generated by or during the course of the Inquiry: the Daily Mail accused Hugh Grant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> mendacious</span><span style="font-style:italic"> smear&#8217;</span> after he had given evidence to the Inquiry when he speculated that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his voicemail had been hacked by or on the instructions of Daily Mail journalists.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup> Second,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a very similar sort of allegation was made by The Sun against Gordon Brown MP in relation</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">terminology used by the paper was that Mr Brown&#8217;s allegation had been &#8216;false and a smear&#8217;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The very obvious parallels between the two stories are notable, and an assessment is made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">below<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">51</a></sup> of the extent to which the press response in those examples was fair and/or to what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extent it reflected a wider culture of aggressive defence.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-44"><a href="#para2-44" name="para2-44">2.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Third, examples were provided of aggressive press attacks on decision makers who brought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposals, or made decisions, perceived to be adverse to parts of the press. Vitriolic attacks</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by The Sun on female critics of Page 3 were prime examples. A further example was the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">response (and not just the NoTW) to Max Mosley&#8217;s victory in his privacy action before Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Justice Eady, which often appeared high in critical volume but low on reasoned and measured</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 30px; color:#ffffff">f</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">analysis. Some editors resorted to<span style="font-style:italic"> ad</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hominem</span> attack, characterising the judge as being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;arrogant&#8217;and&#8216;immoral&#8217;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref52" href="#footnote52">52</a></sup> Adversecommentaboutjudges,andinrelationtojudicialdecisions,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can be entirely legitimate and represent the proper exercise of the right to challenge: I am</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not, for one moment, seeking to suggest otherwise. In this case, however, as was pointed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out in the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee Report on Press Standards, Privacy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Libel,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup> the criticism of the ruling was too often based on a frank misunderstanding of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the judicial role in applying the well-established principles set out in Article 8 of the ECHR</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as explained by the Strasbourg court. In any event, it is worth pointing out that if, Mr Justice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Eady had erred in this regard, it was open to News International to appeal his decision to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Court of Appeal: it did not do so. Had there been good grounds of appeal, it is implausible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that News International would not have sought to exercise its rights.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-45"><a href="#para2-45" name="para2-45">2.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The point goes further: quite apart from the extent to which titles do, in fact, write critically</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about those who have challenged them (all in the name of the exercise of free speech), the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">climate is such that that there is an undeniable perception that this is precisely what will</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">some overcame that expression of fear but others did not. I do not make any finding or reach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any conclusion based upon what is not part of the evidence but the same inference may be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">drawn from the unwillingness of journalists to speak out (which resulted in the necessity to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hear evidence anonymously through the National Union of Journalists). The fear of journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not merely that the relevant title would not employ them: it was that a consequence of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">speaking out would be that they would no longer be able to obtain any employment in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">national press. This feature alone raises real concerns about the culture and practices of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press, in closing ranks and refusing to accept and recognise that legitimate debate about its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">own role and methods of working is not to be shut down but encouraged.</span>
<h4>Failure to take reasonable steps to pre-notify</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-46"><a href="#para2-46" name="para2-46">2.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Article 8 of the ECHR does not place an obligation on newspapers to pre-notify the subjects</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of intended stories as a matter of course<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref54" href="#footnote54">54</a></sup> and it is easily understood why some stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cannot be the subject of pre-notification. However, concerns have been expressed during</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the course of the Inquiry that, in some of those cases where pre-notification did not occur,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">culture and practices have existed within a section of the press of deliberate decisions not to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">take reasonable steps to pre-notify the subjects of news articles in advance, without there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being a good reason not to do so. The principal aim of this was to unfairly deny the subject of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the article the possibility of verifying or challenging it, or to ensure that the story is not lost</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to a competitor. A number of journalists and editors testified to a reluctance to pre-notify in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">certain situations; the evidence relating to Max Mosley&#8217;s privacy action and the publication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Kate McCann diaries provides a powerful insight into the key drivers of press conduct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in this type of situation. Each of these cases is considered as an individual example below,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref55" href="#footnote55">55</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">but the absence of pre-notification is not examined as a problem to be addressed generally.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">All the evidence suggested that a failure to pre-notify was the very rare exception rather than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a recurring practice or culture within the press.</span>
<h4>Failures to take reasonable steps to remedy</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-47"><a href="#para2-47" name="para2-47">2.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Numerous witnesses gave evidence to the Inquiry of the difficulties they have faced in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seeking an opportunity to reply to inaccuracies in stories (notwithstanding clause 2 of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Editors&#8217; Code) and in securing corrections or apologies, either at all or published with suitable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prominence. Given the weight of evidence bearing on this issue (which is considered in detail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">below),<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref56" href="#footnote56">56</a></sup> it may well be difficult for anyone to deny the existence of a problem;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref57" href="#footnote57">57</a></sup> it will,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">however, be necessary to examine whether its manifestation may fairly be characterised as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">illustrative of a cultural failing in the press or a section of the press.</span>

<h2>3. The harm</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Overall, it is possible to group these complaints of unethical practices by the press under two</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">general headings. First, there are a series of complaints which, however formulated, amount</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in essence to an allegation that the press have failed to respect the rights and personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">autonomy of individuals in circumstances where there is no, or no sufficient, public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justification for that failure. Second, there are complaints of inaccuracy in press reporting,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">either in relation to what individuals have or have not done, or in relation to what might be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described as matters of general public interest.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">All the ramifications of unethical conduct by the press need fully to be understood. Some of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these may be obvious: defamatory reporting in relation to individuals is capable of destroying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reputations although an action in libel goes some way to restore the position. Breaches of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privacy may also do the same, and the fact that a story happens to be true (although it should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">never have been published) may lead to damage which cannot be repaired. This consequence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is not inevitable because a breach of privacy which does not result in publication of any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story may have only very limited (if any) adverse consequences: the private information may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only be shared between a handful of journalists who themselves decide to keep it private.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, this prospect aside, some of the consequences of unethical conduct by the press are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">less obvious and therefore require exposition. Furthermore, consideration needs to be given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the broader, and perhaps deeper, consequences for a mature democracy respectful of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rights and freedoms of individuals of inaccurate and unjustifiably intrusive press reporting.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This section of the Report will begin to examine these issues.</span>

<h3>Consequences of intrusive reporting</h3>
<h4>Phone hacking</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">While phone hacking itself is a &#8216;silent crime&#8217; inasmuch as the victim will usually be unaware</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of, or not even suspect, the covert assault on his or her privacy, its consequences &#8211; both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">direct and indirect &#8211; have often been serious and wide-ranging, as the evidence submitted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Inquiry and separately generated by the phone hacking litigation has demonstrated.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 30px; color:#ffffff">f</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has heard how the details of private lives, known only to the witnesses testifying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(in other words, the targets of voicemail hacking) and their most trusted confidants and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">friends, became the subject of articles in the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref58" href="#footnote58">58</a></sup> Further, evidence was also received</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, as a consequence of voicemail hacking, journalists and press photographers were able to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">record moments that were intensely private, such as relationship breakdown,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup> or family grief,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">without either the knowledge or input of the individuals concerned. Sienna Miller explained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">how she was the subject of many articles either speculating on or reporting the state of her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship with the actor Jude Law. In many cases, the information that had formed the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">basis of these articles had been known only to Ms Miller, Mr Law and a very small number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">confidants who had not shared the information further.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup> Ms Miller gave a graphic description</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the fall-out from the voicemail hacking which News International has, of course, admitted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">took place. This included the corrosive loss of trust in aspects of family life, in relationships</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and in friendships, Ms Miller assuming, understandably, that her inner circle was the source of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories in the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref61" href="#footnote61">61</a></sup> She described herself as<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;torn</span><span style="font-style:italic"> between</span><span style="font-style:italic"> feeling</span><span style="font-style:italic"> completely</span><span style="font-style:italic"> paranoid</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">either someone close to [her] [a trusted family member or friend] was selling this information</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the media or that someone was somehow hacking [her] telephone.<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;</span><span style="font-style:normal"> On</span><span style="font-style:normal"> one</span><span style="font-style:normal"> occasion</span><span style="font-style:normal"> she</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sat down with close family members and friends in one room and accused them of leaking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories to the press. Ms Miller explained that she felt that every area of her life was under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">constant surveillance; she felt violated, paranoid and anxious.</span>

<a name="page484"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">believed to be the hacking of Elle Macpherson&#8217;s voicemail. Given the publication of a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">articles about Ms MacPherson which set out in detail confidential information concerning her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal and private life, of which Ms Field had direct knowledge, Ms MacPherson assumed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that Ms Field must have been the source of those stories. Ms Field&#8217;s refusal to acknowledge</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibility led to accusations of illness and then alcoholism for which she subsequently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">underwent treatment. Finally it was decided that Ms Field was incapable of carrying out her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">employment to the required standard and she was dismissed from her position. This led to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">financial difficulties and the loss of friendship.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref62" href="#footnote62">62</a></sup> Ms Field has also made clear how difficult it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been to restore her reputation once such damage had been done.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref63" href="#footnote63">63</a></sup></span>
<h4>Other intrusive conduct</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has heard how the disclosure in the press of embarrassing or personal details</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not only impacts on the self-esteem and reputation of the person involved, but also affects</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">others around them as well. For example, the spouses and children of witnesses have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subjected to bullying and abuse as a consequence of stories written about them. Garry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Flitcroft described the abuse directed at his children at school following the publication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of stories in the press about him.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref64" href="#footnote64">64</a></sup> He detailed how abuse by rival fans was so hurtful and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offensive that his father could no longer watch him play football; he also believes that this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ultimately contributed to his father&#8217;s suicide.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref65" href="#footnote65">65</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Witnesses have also spoken about the distress caused to spouses and partners by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aggressive pursuit of &#8216;kiss and tell&#8217; stories and the knock-on effects of disclosures of infidelity.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In a number of cases the disclosure of marital infidelity is believed to have led or contributed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to a suicide attempt, or had a deleterious impact on the health of vulnerable members of the</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">family.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Charlotte Church said that her mother found articles published by the News of the World</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about her father&#8217;s infidelity, without forewarning, so distressing that it led to an attempt take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her own life.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref66" href="#footnote66">66</a></sup> The Inquiry has heard similar testimony from Max Mosley, who has expressed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the belief that the constant, unflattering and unpleasant coverage of him was a contributing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">factor in the suicide of his son.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref67" href="#footnote67">67</a></sup></span>

<h3>Consequences of inaccurate reporting</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The potential damage done by inaccurate reporting can extend well beyond the intrinsic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">harm attendant on the distortion of fact. Witnesses have explained that it can cause much</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">greater distress, anguish and pain. Taking perhaps the most extreme and unsettling example,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Margaret Watson has set out her belief that inaccurate and partial reporting of the murder of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her daughter, Diane, contributed significantly to the suicide of her son, Alan, who was unable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to cope with the unsubstantiated allegations levelled at his dead sister.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref68" href="#footnote68">68</a></sup> This evidence chimes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with a number of submissions and witness statements received by the Inquiry from ordinary</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref62" name="footnote62" title="Go back to footnote reference 62 in the text">62</a>.  p7, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Witness-Statement-of-Mary-Ellen-Field2.pdf</p><!--footnote-->

<span style="font-size: 15px;">subsequent refusal by the press to engage with attempts to correct those inaccuracies. In a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of cases, that coverage has concerned the suicide of a family member.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-10"><a href="#para3-10" name="para3-10">3.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Evidence of factual misreporting does not merely relate to suicide but also to the reporting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on cases of murder. For example, the Director of Support After Murder and Manslaughter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in Northern Ireland (SAMM NI), Pam Surphlis, described the routine inaccurate reporting by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers of murders committed in the Province. These inaccuracies related to the family</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">details, age and background of the victims, and overall sensationalising of the murders, with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">damaging consequences for the families of the victims.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref69" href="#footnote69">69</a></sup> In her oral evidence Mrs Surphlis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">referred to the newspaper coverage of the murder of a 15 year old boy in which the victim</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was described as a heroin addict, when in fact he was diabetic.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref70" href="#footnote70">70</a></sup> She noted that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> once</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> goes</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">coverage of her death was always represented in a picture of her wedding dress even though</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">she had endured years of marital abuse, notwithstanding that Mrs Surphlis had provided a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different photograph.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref73" href="#footnote73">73</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-11"><a href="#para3-11" name="para3-11">3.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It goes without saying that reporting of this nature is particularly distressing to the family and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">friends of the deceased.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-12"><a href="#para3-12" name="para3-12">3.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The cases of the McCanns and Christopher Jefferies are especially egregious examples of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">defamatory and sensationalised reporting causing, in their different ways, personal anguish</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and distress. These examples are treated in more detail below.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref74" href="#footnote74">74</a></sup></span>

<h4>Impact on public discourse</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-13"><a href="#para3-13" name="para3-13">3.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has received submissions and evidence from various campaign organisations or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressure groups, think tanks, community representative groups, professional practitioners,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">trade bodies and academic institutions complaining of the impact of inaccurate and at times</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discriminatory and inflammatory reporting on public discourse. This is not a criticism of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the right of the press to be partial: it is a complaint specifically directed to inaccuracy. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">problem is aggravated by the unwillingness of the PCC to accept complaints from interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">groups unless there is an identified &#8216;victim&#8217; of the reporting willing to complain.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-14"><a href="#para3-14" name="para3-14">3.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For example, evidence was received from ENGAGE, an organisation set up to promote</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">improved awareness and standards of reporting in the British media of Muslims, as well as to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">encourage greater political participation and civic engagement of Muslims living in Britain.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref75" href="#footnote75">75</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Similar concerns at the damage capable of being caused to community relations and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potentially vulnerable individuals have been raised by other organisations, in particular those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">representing migrant and refugee communities. Such organisations include The Runnymede</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In written evidence submitted to the Inquiry, both the Refugee Council and Migrant and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Refugee Communities Forum suggest that some parts of the press seek deliberately (or, at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">least, recklessly) to conflate statistics for asylum and immigration to imply a growing &#8220;wave&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of asylum seekers coming to the UK, despite evidence that the number of asylum seekers</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his book,<span style="font-style:italic"> Democracy</span><span style="font-style:italic"> under</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Attack</span> , Malcolm Dean of Sheffield University suggested that</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">certain strands of press reporting on asylum and immigration (and often the strand which</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The submissions received in this area went a little further than simply criticising inaccuracies</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">article include the publication of a photograph of the family in question in which the faces</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the children were clearly visible (in breach of the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice), the failure</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">obvious distress but can place them at risk.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref91" href="#footnote91">91</a></sup> Ms Belcher also claimed that the tone of much</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">received praise from some quarters.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref96" href="#footnote96">96</a></sup> Shortly after Helen Belcher had given evidence to the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">but identified as a girl.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref97" href="#footnote97">97</a></sup> In a further written submission to the Inquiry, Trans Media Watch</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggested that both stories were sensationalised and lacked wider context, and that real</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In its submission the Royal College of Psychiatrists also expressed concern at the impact that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the sensationalising of crime can have both on the victims but also on the rehabilitation of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The role of the press in shaping public attitudes to rape and violence against women has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been criticised in evidence submitted by End Violence Against Women Coalition (EVAWC)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and EAVES Housing. The latter&#8217;s submission cites research that it had conducted on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press reporting and statistical realities of rape.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref106" href="#footnote106">106</a></sup> It argues that in the British press there is a</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">disproportionate coverage of the comparatively rare &#8220;stranger rape&#8221; stories and instances of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">falsely reported rapes, but reporting on the most common form of rape, which is committed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by a person known to the victim, is infrequent.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref107" href="#footnote107">107</a></sup> It suggests that the imbalance discourages</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">victims to speak up and report their experiences, believing they do not fall within the &#8220;real</span>

<p id="para-id-3-25"><a href="#para3-25" name="para3-25">3.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Similarly, the EVAWC submission suggests that much press reporting on rape serves to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perpetuate a number of societal myths around rape that are damaging both to victims and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal justice system as a whole. EVAWC notes reporting on a 2009 study which found that</span>

<p id="para-id-3-26"><a href="#para3-26" name="para3-26">3.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These complaints of the trivialisation of violence towards women in some sections of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press are echoed in evidence received by the Inquiry from OBJECT. It argues that the frequent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">juxtaposition in the tabloid press of images and text that depict women as sex objects</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with stories of violence towards women trivialises that subject matter.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref111" href="#footnote111">111</a></sup> In support of this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposition, OBJECT has submitted a number of articles published in The Sun, The Daily Star</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and The Sport in which this juxtaposition is evident. By way of example, OBJECT has drawn</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the attention of the Inquiry to a front page headline in The Sun which read:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Death</span><span style="font-style:italic"> threats</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has also received a submission from Beat, a campaign group which provides</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">support for those tackling eating disorders. In its submission Beat expresses concern at what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it alleges is the use of inappropriate images of severely emaciated women and men in some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parts of the press to illustrate stories on anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref112" href="#footnote112">112</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Beat contends that such images can cause harm to people either suffering or recovering</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from eating disorders,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref113" href="#footnote113">113</a></sup> as well as damage to the public awareness of such disorders by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">creating a false image of sufferers. That said, Beat also acknowledged recent and substantial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">improvements in the accuracy and tone of press reporting on these.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref114" href="#footnote114">114</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-28"><a href="#para3-28" name="para3-28">3.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is worth repeating that both freedom of speech and freedom of the press permit wide</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 30px; color:#ffffff">f</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">latitude to editors and journalists to publish the stories they consider appropriate in the way</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that they wish.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref115" href="#footnote115">115</a></sup> The Editors&#8217; Code of Practice, however, requires care to be taken not to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information (Clause 1(i)) and also requires the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press to avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference to an individual&#8217;s race, colour, religion,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gender, sexual orientation or to any physical or mental illness or disability (Clause 17(i)). That</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is the standard that the press has set for itself. The evidence touched on here, and addressed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further below,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref116" href="#footnote116">116</a></sup> includes reporting which falls at different points along a spectrum: some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may be contentious, opinionated and partial, while still complying with the standard set;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">others may be inaccurate, prejudicial and discriminatory, and fall clearly on the wrong side of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that standard. What is clear is that a critical mass of articles which breach the standard can</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have seriously deleterious effects on public discourse and community relations.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a case study in The Lancet in 1998 as an example of how journalism that they allege was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both inaccurate and unbalanced led to a media generated health scare.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref117" href="#footnote117">117</a></sup> Both the Wellcome</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Trust and Sense About Science have explained that in the immediate aftermath of the most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intense period of coverage there was an estimated fall in vaccination rates of 61% in some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">areas of London,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref118" href="#footnote118">118</a></sup> as well as a much lower take-up of the vaccination overall.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref119" href="#footnote119">119</a></sup> This reduction</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is reported to have had a real impact on the risk that incidence of the diseases will increase</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with potentially serious consequences to those affected.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-30"><a href="#para3-30" name="para3-30">3.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Similar, but more controversial, concerns have been raised by organisations in relation to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reporting of issues as diverse as climate change and drug addiction.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref120" href="#footnote120">120</a></sup> It is unnecessary to do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more than touch on these: the relevant submissions are available on the Inquiry website for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public scrutiny. It goes without saying that the Inquiry has not undertaken the task of forming</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its own expert scientific judgment on this material and, in any event, it is unnecessary that it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should do so.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-31"><a href="#para3-31" name="para3-31">3.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This body of evidence emphasises the need for balanced and responsible reporting on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matters of public interest and, in particular, reporting that reflects the balance of scientific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and/or medical opinion on any specific issue. This need arises because the press is regarded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a reliable and responsible source of information; if it was not so regarded (and the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">itself would hardly want it so), this issue would not arise. If, for example, the overwhelming</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">preponderanceof informed medical opinion is to the effectthata vaccine is safe,any reporting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of suggestive evidence to the contrary effect should recognise and fairly characterise the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nature and quality of that evidence, and accord proper recognition to where the clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consensus of opinion lies. This is not to accord undue weight to the views of the scientific and</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">medical establishment; rather, it is to accord due recognition to the strength of the available</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence to ensure that the position is not misrepresented. As the MMR story made clear,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the failure to do so can have a widespread and harmful impact.</span>

<h3>Inaccuracy and harm: a wider perspective</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-32"><a href="#para3-32" name="para3-32">3.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Overall, there is a broader point which flows from the status and role of the press in a mature</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">democracy as a reliable, authoritative and accurate purveyor of news and information. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press is trusted by its readers to adhere to high standards in terms of getting things right.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The importance of differentiating between fact and opinion is that the public must be in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">position to understand what is<span style="font-style:italic"> fact</span> (and therefore to be relied on as such) and what is<span style="font-style:italic"> opinion</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(and therefore to be understood as precisely that). The public interest in facts being accurate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is that readers may well be misled if they are not, their knowledge about the world may well</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be faulty as a result, and their judgments based on that knowledge may well be imperfect.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The wider harm to the public interest of inaccurate journalism should be seen in that light.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-33"><a href="#para3-33" name="para3-33">3.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is, of course, no bright line for the way that accurate facts are described, or for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">choice of accurate facts that are reported and it is recognised that journalists do not have</span>
