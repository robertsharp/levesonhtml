<h1>CHAPTER 7<br/>CONCLUSION</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The foregoing review of just a representative sample of the vast quantity of evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">submitted to and considered by the Inquiry has served to identify a real problem within the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">culture, practices and ethics of the press. In setting out this evidence at some length I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provided my own evaluation of it, but I believe that I have done so in such a way that anyone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reading this Report with care will be able to reach his or her own view.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Ineedtore-emphasiseapointwhichIhavealreadymademorethanonce.Thereisadifference</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between saying that there is a real problem within the press (including a section of the press)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the one hand and saying that this problem is so widespread that it infects the majority</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of press practice on the other. I am not saying the latter. The unethical practices to which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the evidence points afflict only a section of the press, and even then not for the majority of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the time. Furthermore, in cases where the relevant section of the press has been identified,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am not to be understood as criticising all desks or departments within any individual title,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">still less the majority of journalists working there. The evidence points to a less sweeping</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusion, but one which is nonetheless a cause for significant concern. Although unethical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices have been perpetrated by or within some parts of some titles only for some of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">time, the coverage or strength of the evidence I have read, seen and heard is more than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficient to indicate the presence of a culture (or sub-culture &#8211; the precise terminology does</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">not matter) which subsists and needs to be addressed.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The term &#8216;culture&#8217;, and the approach I should adopt, has been subjected to lengthy analysis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and critique in some of the submissions the Inquiry has received. I have considered all of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these submissions with great care. Whereas this Report is hardly the place for an in depth</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sociological debate into the meaning of complex terms, my approach may be simply stated.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have focused in particular on unethical<span style="font-style:italic"> practices</span> : these fall four-square within my Terms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Reference. My conclusions as to an unethical<span style="font-style:italic"> culture,</span> or<span style="font-style:italic"> sub-culture</span> , flowing from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identification of such practices are necessarily inferential. The evidence has very often</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">demonstrated the existence of identical practices in more than one title, and on many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occasions across several titles. The prevalence of such practices will vary as between titles,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the Inquiry has in any event largely avoided an attempt to carry out a quantitative as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opposed to a qualitative evaluation. But what this Inquiry has focused on throughout is the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">presence of practices which are more than isolated, coincidental or accidental both within</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual titles and, viewing the matter more widely, a relevant section of the press. In other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">words, evidence of a culture within a title, or a part of a title, which is common to, similar, or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identical within another title, or part of another title, can be regarded as evidence of a culture</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within a section of a press; and, furthermore, of a problem which needs to be addressed (not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">least by the provision of an appropriate regulator) by the press as a whole.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Another highly relevant factor is that it is not too difficult to discern common themes and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">patterns within the categories of unethical conduct described and evidenced earlier.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> These</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">categories are already to some extent artificial, and they undoubtedly overlap. Take the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">example of phone hacking. True, it is illegal, and many forms of subterfuge are not; but on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">analysis it shares much in common with other forms of unethical conduct which the Inquiry</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref1" name="footnote1" title="Go back to footnote reference 1 in the text">1</a>.  Part F, Chapter 6</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page717"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">has examined. Surveillance of targets in search of a story full of prurient details but devoid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of public interest, and the blagging of information to support a similar sort of story, are in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">essence not vastly different in moral &#8211; as opposed to technological &#8211; terms from listening</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into a voicemail in pursuit of similar tittle-tattle. Furthermore, hovering above all of these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices are additional matters of commonality: in particular, a failure to respect the personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">autonomy of individuals, and a concomitant tendency to treat celebrities in particular as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">objects rather than as individuals, because they have &#8216;sold&#8217; any entitlement to privacy; a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">tendency to regard the public interest as a form of trump card, on the basis that the work</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers do is right, because they are surrogates for their readers and are exercising the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">right to free speech; and, in more extreme cases, a propensity to regard journalism as above</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the law, because newspapers are the ultimate guardians of both free speech and the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On this approach, one may even more readily detect a problem, in the form of a collection of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">similar practices, which may fairly be described as cultural. Plainly, my approach is somewhat</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in contrast with the thesis that some have advanced that the real problem within the culture,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and ethics of the press is, or rather was, that of phone hacking which is therefore</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sui generis<span style="font-style:normal"> or</span><span style="font-style:normal"> &#8216;special&#8217;,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> peculiar</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> one</span><span style="font-style:normal"> (now</span><span style="font-style:normal"> defunct)</span><span style="font-style:normal"> title.</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Some</span><span style="font-style:normal"> go</span><span style="font-style:normal"> even</span><span style="font-style:normal"> further,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have sought to argue that current police investigations into phone hacking and other criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conduct have been unfair and disproportionate. For reasons which, by now, I have made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">crystal clear, I totally reject these forms of special pleading. They ignore the evidence the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry has received and, in their most extreme form, come close to suggesting that journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should not be subject to the rule of law. But in my view there is no more precious principle in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a mature democracy.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Those reading the whole of Part F of this Report may be forgiven for thinking that the pages</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">covering good practice are far outnumbered by those covering the bad. I have already made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the point that it would be a gross error to measure my assessment of the press in terms of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the number of words expended. It is in the nature of public inquiries to investigate areas</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of public concern and adduce detailed evidence to enable those areas to be probed. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">preponderance of good practice within the press, including those sections of the press which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been the focus of criticism, has been recognised by most of the witnesses who have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">testified; it also chimes with my own experience. This statement requires more than mere</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognition; it deserves explanation and elaboration, and the Chapter above meets these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pre-requisites.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have already exempted the regional press from the generality of my findings, but I should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">address the position of magazines. In their submissions to the Inquiry, News International</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(NI) invited me to desegregate magazines from newspapers for this purpose on the basis that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there is no evidence that they share a common culture, practices and ethics. A number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publishers of magazines have addressed this issue more directly, and have pointed out that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the pressures on magazines are somewhat distinct from those operating on newspapers:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they are published less frequently, and there is less of a call for the eye-catching headline</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or the sensationalised story, as one such publisher put it to me. Additionally, the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only heard from three magazine editors and their evidence was confined to the admittedly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important issues of celebrity, intrusion, breaches of privacy, and harassment by paparazzi.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Some of this evidence did not place these magazines in an altogether favourable light, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been covered elsewhere. But save in these specific respects it is appropriate that I exempt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">magazines from the generality of my findings.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref2" name="footnote2" title="Go back to footnote reference 2 in the text">2</a>.  Part F, Chapter 2</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page718"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not the purpose of this concluding section on the culture, practices and ethics of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press simply to summarise that which has already been set out at length. Instead, I intend to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apply a somewhat broader perspective.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. Possible causes</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Turning now to this wider perspective, a number of possible causes of the problem have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been raised and ventilated during the course of the Inquiry, and it is appropriate to address</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these. Some have suggested that a press which rightly prides itself on its irreverence and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fearlessness is almost destined to manifest a tendency to go too far and overreach itself. A</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press, they say, which is fearful and overly cautious would be inclined to be supine, and fail to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discharge its primary function which is to hold power to account.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Others have suggested that unethical press practices are the result of one of two broad</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sociological factors. First, many would argue that the modern celebrity culture cannot simply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be an artefact of a certain section of the press; it is a reflection of the fact that many people</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appear to be endlessly curious about the personal lives of sportsmen and women, film and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pop stars, fashion models and those who attain celebrity status without having done much</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more than create or benefit from a public persona which attracts interest. Whereas the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a whole were rightly horrified by the revelations at News of the World (NoTW) because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that title&#8217;s methods so obviously crossed a red line into illegal and unethical territory, the self</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">same public might well take a different view as regards lesser degrees of intrusion. Secondly,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">many have also argued that elements of the press in this country have acquired a sense of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impunity, of being above the law, because they have become too powerful, their economic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and social power having become concentrated into too few hands.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have set out these possible causes without necessarily endorsing any of them. This is so for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">two reasons. First, many of these potential causes, assuming that they have been correctly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identified, are beyond the scope of this Inquiry to the extent that it is difficult if not impossible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to devise an antidote or a solution. If, for example, the problem lies within society as a whole,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there could be little or nothing I could say or recommend to encourage (let alone force) the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">tectonic plates to move into an altogether different place. Secondly, and in any event, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry has not investigated many of these alleged causal factors to the extent necessary to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reach clear conclusions on these complex issues, and I doubt whether it would have had the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expertise to do so in all instances.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That said, there are three aspects of the wider problem which merit further attention: first,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the impact of commercial pressures in a shrinking newspaper market; secondly, the range of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues surrounding the modern employment context and the pressures exerted on journalists,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and finally, issues of internal governance and leadership. These issues have been explored in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the evidence and in submissions, and the Inquiry is in a position to examine them.</span>

<h3>Commercial pressures</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Many have pointed to the impact of commercial pressures in a dwindling marketplace. These</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressures encourage excessive risk taking by titles that are in an incessant circulation war</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with one another; there are also pressures which operate on journalists at the metaphorical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;coal-face&#8217;, some of which may require them to meet unrealistic targets and deadlines, and to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cut corners as regards the exigencies of fact checking and adherence to the letter and spirit</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">of the Editors&#8217; Code.</span>
<a name="page719"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has been told by a large number of witnesses that the economic environment in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which newspapers operate is challenging; indeed, this is a hard fact which cannot seriously</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be disputed. Certainly, newspaper publishers in the UK operate in a highly competitive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">market where margins are tight and the competition for stories is intense: these factors exert</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considerable pressure both on editors trying to fill newssheet and journalists seeking copy.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although some newspapers are highly profitable, the overall market is in decline and has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been for many years, this is increasingly characterised by shrinking revenue streams and low</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">profitability. Market share has been steadily eroded over the last eighty years or so: first by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">radio, and then the advent and growth of television, from one channel in the early days, to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the explosion of channels made possible by the introduction of satellite television services</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the rollout of digital television. This loss of market share has been further exacerbated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">over the last 20 years by the growth of the internet and the close to exponential increase in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the availability of mixed media services through that medium.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whilst some newspapers have been able to halt the decline in sales, most newspapers have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lost sales at a rate that threatens the future economic viability of many titles. This is a trend</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that is more acute at, but not restricted to, the local and regional level than at national level.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The ability of newspapers to grow their own sales in the context of this overall decline is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also constrained by the tribal loyalties of readers. Clare Enders of Enders Analysis has told</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry that overall only 2% of the market is contestable. It is unsurprising therefore that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the commercial need to sell stories believed to be of interest to the public is an increasingly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potent consideration.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The impact of these pressures is not uniform. The evidence has also indicated that a difference</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in commercial imperatives exists between the broadsheets and tabloids. The journalist Nick</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Davies has suggested that the ownership and financial management of the Guardian by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Scott Trust has enabled the paper to distance itself from any commercial expectation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">maximise profit.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By contrast, Mr Davies has suggested that tabloid newspapers are likely to place a greater</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">emphasis on circulation numbers than the broadsheets. In part, this view has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantiated by the evidence to the Inquiry presented by both tabloid and middle market</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper editors, as well as by evidence presented to the Inquiry by the former tabloid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists Richard Peppiatt, Mathew Driscoll and Paul McMullan. On the other hand, Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Richard Desmond, the owner of the Northern and Shell Group and publisher of the Daily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Express and Daily Star newspapers, said in evidence that he did not believe that there was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a direct correlation between stories and sales. Other witnesses from his titles (and indeed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">elsewhere) expressed the same view, drawing on circulation data relating to the period when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the story of the abduction of Madeline McCann featured heavily on the front page of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Daily Express.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-12"><a href="#para2-12" name="para2-12">2.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry need not resolve this issue, but I make the following broad observation. It may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">well be that the examination of any one individual case, such as the McCann example, will fail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to demonstrate a &#8216;spike&#8217; in sales over a relatively short period of time. However, it is a different</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question, and one less verifiable by empirical evidence, as to whether the publication of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular types of story over many months and years is responsible, at least in part, for long</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">term trends and patterns in newspaper circulations.</span>
<a name="page720"></a><!--new page--><h2>employment issues</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The demand for circulation appears to create, at least within some newspaper titles, a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significant pressure on journalists to perform. Some of the journalists who have given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence to the Inquiry make clear that the pressures to secure copy are extreme, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that their jobs and livelihoods are at stake on an almost daily basis, particularly for those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on temporary or informal contracts. The challenges operating in the print market are most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obviously manifest in the reduction in journalist headcount across the national and regional</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press. The consequences for those journalists who remain are broadly uniform; they must</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">produce more stories of interest to readers on reduced resource.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-14"><a href="#para2-14" name="para2-14">2.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In evidence to the Inquiry, a number of journalists have explained that they were required</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to produce a particular number of bylines in a given time frame. In many cases there were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sanctions if these targets were not met; for those on short term contracts this might mean</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the termination of that contract. The former NoTW journalist, Paul McMullan has told the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry that he kept his own cuttings in order to keep a record of the minimum of 12 bylines</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">per year he was required to produce at the NoTW. The Guardian journalist David Leigh has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggested that, as a consequence of this pressure to generate a tangible product, at some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers there existed a real culture of fear among journalists if targets were not met.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">James Hipwell, the former city correspondent for the Daily Mirror, described similar pressure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at that title and recalled occasions where staff would receive emails from the then editor,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Piers Morgan, berating them for not delivering enough exclusive stories for the paper.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thechallengingeconomiccircumstancesinwhichmanynewspapersoperateandthecontinual</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressure on the bottom line of most newspaper businesses has led many newspapers to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">introduce new ways of working, often built around short term contracts, a growth in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the use of freelancers and a reduction in the number of permanent staff posts. Michelle</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Stanistreet, General Secretary of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), has suggested that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this increased casualisation of journalists&#8217; employment across the newspaper industry has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">created an environment of great uncertainty for many newspaper employees. Ms Stanistreet</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">claimed that journalists employed on a casual or short-term basis were forced to work under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">even greater pressures than permanent members of staff. She articulated the concerns that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been raised with the NUJ by freelance journalists. These included employment without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">job security and a failure to provide journalists with the basic resources they needed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undertake their work; such as the failure to provide a laptop, mobile phone and the ability</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of claiming expenses. Ms Stanistreet also said that casual and freelance journalists worked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with permanent staff in the same pressurised newsroom environment, but invested greater</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resources and faced higher potential losses should they fail to deliver stories or other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">achievements.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-17"><a href="#para2-17" name="para2-17">2.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This characterisation of short term and temporary contract work presented by Ms Stanistreet</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was echoed in the evidence of Steve Turner, General Secretary of the British Association of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Journalists. He highlighted the apparent injustice of journalists being forced to work on short-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">term contracts for many years, and the fact that reporters were put under impossible pressure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to produce stories without being given the resources to do so. This was also reflected in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence of the journalists Richard Peppiatt and Sharon Marshall.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-18"><a href="#para2-18" name="para2-18">2.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has heard from journalists working at both tabloid and broadsheet titles who have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">spoken about the prevalence of bullying in some newsrooms and, in particular, the bullying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of relatively junior and sometimes vulnerable staff by senior management teams, including</span>
<a name="page721"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">editors, and the impact that such behaviour has on the working practice of journalists. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Part F, Chapter 4, I found that bullying had taken place at the NoTW.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-19"><a href="#para2-19" name="para2-19">2.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It must be noted, however, that the majority of the journalists who testified before the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">denied that there was a culture of bullying in the newspapers in which they worked. They</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">freely acknowledged that the environment was competitive and pressurised, but it might be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said that the same descriptors could be applied to many work places in different walks of life.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-20"><a href="#para2-20" name="para2-20">2.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am not suggesting for one moment that any witness deliberately misled the Inquiry when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">giving evidence along these lines. But had there been, for example, a culture of bullying or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of turning a blind-eye to ethical standards at any title, I doubt whether many journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would have been prepared to tell me that in terms. Furthermore, whether a work-place is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;competitive and pressured&#8217; is to some extent a subjective impression, as is the subsidiary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue of whether pressure is a force for the good or the bad.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-21"><a href="#para2-21" name="para2-21">2.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Apart from the anonymous evidence adduced through Ms Stanistreet, and the evidence from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Steve Turner, General Secretary of the British Association of Journalists, a limited number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of former journalists did speak to the existence of a bullying and less than ethical culture in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the papers in which they worked. The qualitative deficiencies of the anonymous evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">must be recognised, and in respect of each of the former journalists there are reasons for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">treating their evidence with caution. I have examined their evidence in previous sections of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Report, but here I set out two pieces of evidence which struck a particular chord with me:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this is because of the way in which the evidence was given, its inherent plausibility, and its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consistency with other evidence.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-22"><a href="#para2-22" name="para2-22">2.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Matthew Driscoll, formerly of NoTW, told the Inquiry in an extended sequence of answers:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. You tell us in your witness statement at paragraphs 7 to that you spoke to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">colleagues about this blagging technique and they told you that the practice had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">gone on for some time and also that the obtaining of medical records was common</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">practice. Do you recollect that?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. It was certainly something that wasn&#8217;t a rarity, no.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Did you ever raise your concerns with your sports editor or with anyone else at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">the time?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. No. I mean &#8211; well, I certainly raised my surprise that anything like that could be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">done. That was all new to me, having come from the Daily Star. But, you know, as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I&#8217;ve thought about it long and hard, it would be a very brave journalist, certainly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the early years of his career on the paper, to suddenly say, &#8220;I&#8217;m not happy with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">these techniques that are being used.&#8221; You&#8217;d be basically making a decision over your</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">career there. Anyone on that floor who complained too much would find themselves</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pushed out, certainly.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Can you assist us with why you think this type of practice was going on? What was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the purpose? Why did they have to resort to this?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. The main reason is to make sure a story&#8217;s true. You know, this is kind of the irony,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">really. Tabloid newspapers are very fearful of getting a story badly wrong, and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">lawyers are just as &#8211; the in-house lawyers are just as scared of that because it costs</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a lot of money if you do get it wrong. Not only do you have the humiliation of putting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an apology in the paper or it being followed up and being disproved by other papers,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it can then cost you a lot of money in out-of-court settlements, and money is the be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">all and end all of tabloid newspapers, really, and the pressure was on to make sure</span>
<a name="page722"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a story was correct and that you wouldn&#8217;t get any comeback legally. So there was a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pressure to use, as it now turns out, almost any means necessary to make sure that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a story was 100 per cent true.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Are there any other blagging incidents that you&#8217;d like to draw to our attention?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Only ones I heard of. The examples I&#8217;ve given you are the ones I&#8217;d directly worked</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">on, yeah.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">LORDJUSTICE LEVESON:I&#8217;msorry,Ijusthavetofollowupthelastanswer.Soeverything</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that was done was done to avoid libel?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. That&#8217;s my opinion, yeah, certainly.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Any consideration given to concepts of propriety or privacy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I&#8217;m sure there would have been sometimes, but I think the biggest priority was to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">make sure that that story was true, to make sure there would be no litigation further</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">down the road. I think that&#8217;s where the onus lied.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-23"><a href="#para2-23" name="para2-23">2.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I recount this evidence without making any judgment about the managerial approach at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW (beyond that expressed in Chapter 4 of this Part of the Report) but it is important as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">providing an insight into press culture for a number of reasons. For present purposes, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">focus is on what Mr Driscoll had to say about an environment which effectively precluded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whistleblowing or speaking out.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-24"><a href="#para2-24" name="para2-24">2.24</a></p>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressures on journalists:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It was quite common to be threatened with the sack. Frankly, if a journalist doesn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bring in enough exclusives or enough stories, then what use is he to a newspaper?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">This is a highly competitive industry. You can easily be replaced. It takes you years and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">years to get to &#8211; you know, to get onto a national newspaper, very often, and, you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know, you don&#8217;t want to blow it by not pulling your weight, and the fact is if you don&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bring in great copy, great exclusives, you&#8217;re not going to last in the job.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-25"><a href="#para2-25" name="para2-25">2.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I appreciate that both Mr Driscoll and Mr Hipwell have been challenged on the basis of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bias, the former because of his complaints directed at the NoTW and the latter following his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">treatment (and his conviction) while working at the Daily Mirror. The entirety of the evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">received by the Inquiry, however, points strongly to the conclusion that journalists were and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are reluctant, if not afraid, to speak out about whatever unethical or illegal activities they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">came across, however frequently or infrequently that might have been. Equally, it is difficult</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to avoid the conclusion that the failure to provide protection to whistleblowers contributed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to this reluctance.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Piers Morgan, former editor of the NoTW and the Daily Mirror, did not express concern that,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to his knowledge, there were no &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; policies in place at NoTW or the Daily Mirror</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">during his period as editor at these papers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Richard Peppiatt, a former journalist at the Daily Star, vividly described a culture in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whistleblowing was deterred:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></span>

<a name="page723"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It seemed to me that reporters&#8217; employment contracts were structured specifically</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to limit the possibility of any ethical protest. Many, including myself, were on casual</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contracts, which is to say they can be terminated at anytime. The spectre of being</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8217;let go&#8217; at any moment is a powerful deterrent against sticking your head above the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">trench if you disagree with something that is occurring. Even if someone was bold</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enough to complain, no channel existed for employees to raise concerns about ethical</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or journalistic practices. My feeling was certainly that the further up the chain of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">command you went the less, not more, concern over newsroom behaviour existed.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-28"><a href="#para2-28" name="para2-28">2.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whistleblowing is usually protected under the provisions of the Employment Rights Act 1996</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the extent that employers are not empowered to act to the detriment of employees in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to public interest disclosures. However, there is a strong argument for recommending</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">greater protection in this regard, and in my view the case advanced by the NUJ to the effect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that &#8216;conscience clauses&#8217; should be routinely introduced into the contracts of employment of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists is more than justified.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-29"><a href="#para2-29" name="para2-29">2.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The NUJ goes yet further, and has argued through its General Secretary, Michelle Stanistreet,</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;... there is a connection between the anti-trade union culture at News International</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the moral vacuum that&#8217;s been allowed to proliferate.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The culture stems from the top of the organisation yet it is ordinary working journalists</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who are being sacrificed and whose livelihoods have been destroyed whilst those at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the top of News International enjoy impunity.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-30"><a href="#para2-30" name="para2-30">2.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although I can see the clear possibility of a causal connection between a culture where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists are reluctant to speak out and the presence and in particular the perpetuation of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unethical practices, Ms Stanistreet&#8217;s point about a similar anti-trade union culture and such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices is a more controversial proposition. She may be right, but I am not in a position to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">express a concluded view about this on the limited evidence I have heard.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-31"><a href="#para2-31" name="para2-31">2.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Taken together, these different pressures (a competitive market, growth of new media,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">declining circulation, reduction of journalist headcount, reduced budgets, a casualisation of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">workforce, a lack of support to whistleblowers, and a sometimes bullying culture) risk the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prioritisation of the pursuit of a story over all other, ethical, considerations. It is of interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that in her evidence to the Inquiry, Ms Marshall has said that in her experience there were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no ethical conversations in journalism. Her evidence echoed the view of Northern and Shell</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proprietor, Richard Desmond, when he told the Inquiry that:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;We</span><span style="font-style:italic"> do</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> talk</span><span style="font-style:italic"> about</span><span style="font-style:italic"> ethics</span><span style="font-style:italic"> or</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">does the existence of the sort of commercial factors identified here. But these risks may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or not mature in the real world and separate consideration needs to be given to that. For</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">example, an unpromising commercial environment might nonetheless engender exemplary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newsroom practices in any given case: this would be the consequence of there being editors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and journalists of sufficient calibre to withstand the pressures and temptations operating on</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">good practice will have a tendency to generate bad practice.</span>

<h3>Leadership and governance</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-33"><a href="#para2-33" name="para2-33">2.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have mentioned commercial pressures on titles and personal pressures on journalists, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">many would say that the emphasis should be more specific. To the extent that the Inquiry has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identified a real problem within the culture, practices and ethics of the press, many would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argue that the proximate cause of that problem should be visualised as being one of a failure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of leadership and internal governance. The culture and tone of an organisation is set by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and from the top: in terms of leading by example, insisting on adherence to standards, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">implementing systems of governance which serve to identify and eliminate both legal and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethical risk at all levels of the organisation.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-34"><a href="#para2-34" name="para2-34">2.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry does not propose to comment in depth on the quality of leadership at NoTW</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(or higher up the corporate ladder into NI or News Corp) in any greater detail than set out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">earlier, since to do so might prejudice the criminal trials of at least two (if not many more)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals. By extension, I will need to take care in examining the position in relation to other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">titles in case my reasoning and conclusions are transposed back onto NoTW or run the risk of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offending what I have described in the Introduction as the self denying ordinance. I repeat,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not for the first time, that this part of the Inquiry has been focused on aspects of the practices</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press at a higher level than the specifics &#8216;who did what to whom, who authorised it and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who knew about it&#8217;; its purpose is to address issues of regulation. Within these obvious and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ever-present constraints, it is both possible and appropriate to set out some concerns, even</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">if these fall short of amounting to clear-cut and transparent conclusions.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-35"><a href="#para2-35" name="para2-35">2.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A review of the evidence adduced before the Inquiry and already analysed has given rise to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern in at least two respects. First, it is suggestive of leadership and internal governance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">failures in relation to the use of private investigators and the making of cash payments: on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any view, these were high risk areas which warranted a firmer hand on the tiller. Second there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are concerns in relation to the use of &#8216;sources&#8217;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-36"><a href="#para2-36" name="para2-36">2.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It has already been pointed out that a number of editors and lawyers confessed to having no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">knowledge that private investigators and search agencies were used at their titles. By way</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of example only, the editor of the Daily Star, Dawn Neesom, stated that she was not aware</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that search agencies were being used until their existence was brought to her attention by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her legal team.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> This was also the case for Hugh Whittow, editor of the Daily Express and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his predecessor in that role, Peter Hill. Hugh Whittow stated that he &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> had</span><span style="font-style:italic"> no</span><span style="font-style:italic"> knowledge</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Elsewhere, executives, editors and lawyers who were aware of the use of private investigators</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and search agencies, conceded that they had no knowledge of the methods deployed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obtain information. Few expressed concern about this lack of knowledge, even with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">benefit of hindsight. This lack of concern was evident in the evidence of Nicole Patterson,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">head of legal at the Express and Star titles. Ms Patterson expressed the view that newspapers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were entitled to expect search agencies and private investigators would operate within the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">law to obtain information:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about doing what they do. You employ a company to do something for you and you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expect that they would do it within the law. You expect that. Not that you don&#8217;t care.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">You expect it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-38"><a href="#para2-38" name="para2-38">2.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Other editors shared Ms Patterson&#8217;s expectation that search agencies would operate within</span>

<p id="para-id-2-39"><a href="#para2-39" name="para2-39">2.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Patterson also expressed the view that, as head of legal, the question of what methods</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were used were not within her remit; such considerations were editorial matters.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup> However,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">as has already been noted, Ms Neesom, Mr Whittow and Mr Hill, each editors at titles owned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the Northern & Shell during Ms Patterson&#8217;s time as head of legal, gave evidence that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they were unaware of the use of search agencies and private investigators. At its lowest, this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">revealed a degree of confusion within management as to the allocation of responsibility for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">overseeing the use of external providers of information.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-40"><a href="#para2-40" name="para2-40">2.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It was also revealing that most lawyers who gave evidence to the Inquiry had backgrounds in</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">John Witherow, editor of The Sunday Times, was clear in his evidence that the editor bore</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibility for the conduct of any third party used to obtain information.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup> However,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when questioned about the extent to which it was possible to police external providers of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information, Mr Witherow conceded that it was down to individual journalists to ensure that</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">alone in delegating responsibility for the supervision of private investigators to journalists.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The former editor of the Daily Mirror, Richard Wallace, stated:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;During my time as Editor of the Daily Mirror we have used, on occasion, the services</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of private investigators. I have not directly commissioned or had direct contact with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">them. They would, of course, have been paid for their services, but I would not be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">involved in their instructions have knowledge of what they were doing or be involved</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the nuts and bolts of their payment.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-42"><a href="#para2-42" name="para2-42">2.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Against this backdrop, it is of some concern that the evidence to the Inquiry from most editors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was that there was no procedure or protocol in place in relation to when private investigators</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or third party sources could be used, how they were identified, or the methods they were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">permitted to employ.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-43"><a href="#para2-43" name="para2-43">2.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In place of protocols or procedures, emphasis was placed on the expectation that third parties</span>

<p id="para-id-2-44"><a href="#para2-44" name="para2-44">2.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Sunday Times was the only title to give evidence that they have adopted a more formal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach to the use of external providers of information since the phone hacking scandal. As</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Witherow explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;[I]n the light of the phone hacking scandal we have naturally checked to make sure</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">formal understandings with freelancers to make sure they abide by the law and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">PCC Code, although most are already accredited to reputable organisations which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">require such behaviour. We have also introduced a more formal approach when</span>

<a name="page727"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">being discussed by the heads of news, the newspaper&#8217;s lawyers and the Editor and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Managing Editor, with a formal minute made of the decision.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-45"><a href="#para2-45" name="para2-45">2.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It appears that, at the majority of titles, there is no formal system in place to govern when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists may engage external providers of information, and on what basis. Without the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adoption of such a system, editors and lawyers will continue to have difficulties in controlling</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">third party sources and holding accountable those responsible for unethical conduct. If the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conditions which enabled the use of private investigators to go unchecked for so long are to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">avoided, significant improvements must be made to systems for monitoring and supervision.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-46"><a href="#para2-46" name="para2-46">2.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A related issue is the adequacy, or lack of it, of systems for recording payments made for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information. It appears that until recently such expenditure was dealt with as ordinary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expenses claims, with the result that there was little oversight at editorial level.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup> A number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of editors gave evidence that the amounts paid to external sources were small and did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attract attention so that there was never any cause to question the expenditure.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-47"><a href="#para2-47" name="para2-47">2.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Some titles have acknowledged the need to improve the financial accounting system</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and have introduced new systems to monitor expenditure. For example, at NI there was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acknowledgement that the payments control system was inadequate and it was replaced in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">September 2011.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup> Before then it was left up to the discretion of the managing editor whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or not to question individual payments. Under the new system the policy makes clear that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists should use non cash methods of payment for information, and only when the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">source insists on a cash payment is it acceptable to pay in cash. The journalist requesting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the cash must obtain agreement from his or her departmental head that payment be made,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that authorisation must be countersigned by the editor or a deputy editor, as well as the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">managing editor. It is notable, however, that the new system does not necessarily require the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identification of the recipient of cash payments and there is no limit to cash payments.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Most of the editors who gave evidence to the Inquiry acknowledged that responsibility for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deciding whether to publish a story rests with them. However, most also stated that they</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Editors expressed the common view that primary responsibility for checking sources lies with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the journalist. This in itself is an appropriate delegation of responsibility. However, it has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">become clear that there are inadequate systems in place to verify sources. The gravamen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the evidence received by the Inquiry was along the lines that only if something about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story caught an editor&#8217;s attention would the reliability of sources be questioned.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup> A number</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">was justified, in part, by the need to protect source anonymity.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup> More generally, editors</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although a degree of trust in subordinates is required in the operation of any organisation,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there is concern as to the extent of unchecked discretion afforded to journalists across</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the newspaper industry, and it is certainly arguable that this sort of<span style="font-style:italic"> laissez-faire</span> attitude</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">engendered a climate in which more serious ethical and legal breaches could be permitted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to occur. Furthermore, this lack of supervision and excessive degree of trust may well have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fostered a culture in which journalists feel able to publish stories on the basis of a single,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unverified source.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-53"><a href="#para2-53" name="para2-53">2.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The complacency evidenced in the presumption that individual journalists would act lawfully</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and ethically is all the more concerning when viewed in the context of the failure within the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press to develop effective systems to govern standards of conduct. In an industry which relies</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so heavily on the delegation of responsibility to journalists, it is essential that stringent codes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of conduct and systems of accountability are developed and implemented. However, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">available evidence suggests that there was a failure across significant sections of the industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to develop and implement appropriate systems to govern conduct and ethics. The Editors&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Code of Practice provided a reasonable benchmark for adequate practice, but the evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examined in Chapter 6 above suggests that not enough was done to ensure compliance,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that such systems as were in place were and are informal in nature and defined by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personalities of the individuals in positions of leadership.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-54"><a href="#para2-54" name="para2-54">2.54</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Peppiatt provided the following account of the treatment of the PCC Code during his time</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a journalist at the Daily Star:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I would describe corporate governance at the Daily Star as laissez-faire at best.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There was little or nothing in the way of documents or official policies governing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">conduct. I was never asked or offered the opportunity to sign a code of conduct, nor</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">did there exist to my knowledge an &#8217;employee handbook&#8217; type resource to reference.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The PCC Code was not something that I ever heard referenced in relation to how</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a story should be handled, although certain limitations such as not trespassing in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hospitals were implicitly acknowledged. I have admitted that some stories I wrote at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Daily Star were wholly inaccurate, often written under pressure from superiors to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">distort the facts at hand. For me to have referenced the PCC Code to protest against</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this I would have been laughed out the door.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-55"><a href="#para2-55" name="para2-55">2.55</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Asked to describe how the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice was enforced at the Daily Star, Ms Neesom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gave the following evidence:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It&#8217;s just expected of the staff and it&#8217;s enforced by people not being very happy with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">them if they mess up &#8230; The journalist concerned will probably be warned by the news</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">desk that they have done something wrong &#8230; I personally probably wouldn&#8217;t talk to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the journalist concerned, but the news desk or my deputy editor would.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">foster those qualities, his answer revealed that ethical controls at The Sun are similarly ad</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hoc, relying on the judgment of individual journalists and the initiatives and attentions of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual managers rather than being systematic:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think just on &#8211; an editor can &#8211; their contact on a day-to-day basis with their staff, so</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whether that be in morning news conference, during my features conferences, during</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my lunchtime plot meetings or my presence on the back bench in the newsroom on a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">daily basis, I think people know what I expect of them and know what standards and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ethics that I stand by.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-58"><a href="#para2-58" name="para2-58">2.58</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the absence of formal systems of enforcement, even instances of clear and serious breaches</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Codes did not result in significant disciplinary action. The Inquiry has already examined</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in depth the response of senior management at the NoTW to Mr Justice Eady&#8217;s strictures in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to the thinly-veiled threats to two of the women involved in the Max Mosley privacy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">claim, and has touched on that of senior management at Trinity Mirror in relation to the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the wagons, defend that which has been criticised (even judicially) and attacking those who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">utter the criticism and, in some cases, garnering support from others in the industry. Free</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">speech is, of course, of critical importance; judges (among others) are not infallible and are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">well used to being criticised without having the ability to respond. Similar criticism can be</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">advanced about appellate decisions. What is missing, however, is internal reflection about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(and action in respect of) breaches of the Code which are worthy of censure.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-59"><a href="#para2-59" name="para2-59">2.59</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Putting to one side that fact that an editor is ultimately responsible for what is published,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">questions naturally arise as to whether the real problem within the culture, practices and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethics of the press which this Inquiry has identified should be regarded as a failure of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">leadership. For reasons which have already been fully explained, it is unnecessary to venture</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into the territory of whether an editor at any particular title must have been aware of<span style="font-style:italic"> specific</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">malpractice merely by virtue of his or her position. I have in fact already made clear that a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of editors were unaware, for example, of the extensive use of private investigators</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within their organisations, and if this evidence is to be accepted (and there is nothing directly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to contradict it) it does tend to suggest that the editorial role does not automatically carry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with it knowledge and understanding of every journalistic practice which is in play in the title</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for which the editor is responsible.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-60"><a href="#para2-60" name="para2-60">2.60</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Approaching the issue at a far higher level of generality, however, it is possible to express</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a number of tentative views. The point has already been made that the culture or tone of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although it would be equally counter-intuitive to regard journalists as purely the &#8216;victims&#8217; of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such a culture, or of an ethical vacuum created by inaction at the highest levels within the</span>

<p id="para-id-2-61"><a href="#para2-61" name="para2-61">2.61</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Insight into issues of this sort was provided by Richard Desmond&#8217;s candid evidence to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry, betraying a reluctance on his part to engage with what might be thought to be a basic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">questions that all those in journalism should be prepared to focus on. He said: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Ethical</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8211;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">adding, as noted above: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> We</span><span style="font-style:italic"> do</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> talk</span><span style="font-style:italic"> about</span><span style="font-style:italic"> ethics</span><span style="font-style:italic"> or</span><span style="font-style:italic"> morals</span><span style="font-style:italic"> because</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> fine</span><span style="font-style:italic"> line</span></span>

<p id="para-id-2-62"><a href="#para2-62" name="para2-62">2.62</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Even when those in a leadership role acknowledged errors of judgment, they were unwilling</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to confront the ethical component of that failure. Many editors expressed regret at the way in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which the Christopher Jefferies story was reported; yet none sought to explore what ethical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards had been transgressed in this episode. For example, Mr Wallace viewed the failings</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which led to the publication of the Jefferies story as a &#8220;black mark&#8221; on his career, stating</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> think</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Jefferies&#8217;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> name</span><span style="font-style:italic"> will</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> imprinted</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> my</span><span style="font-style:italic"> brain</span><span style="font-style:italic"> forever</span><span style="font-style:italic"> more.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> It</span><span style="font-style:italic"> will</span><span style="font-style:italic"> change</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">consider that any practical changes could be made to reduce the risk of recurrence, stating:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Ultimately it&#8217;s down to the judgments of editors and, you know, as I found in this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regard and other mistakes have been highlighted, we all make mistakes. I&#8217;m not</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">seeking to downplay those mistakes or dismiss them; I&#8217;m just saying you can have as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">many safeguards and checks and balances in place you would like but these errors</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are going to happen. It&#8217;s about creating a climate, I believe, which makes all editors</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think perhaps a little bit longer than they have previously.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-63"><a href="#para2-63" name="para2-63">2.63</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the absence of clear leadership on ethical standards, it is at least arguable that journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">latched on to alternative barometers of what amounted to acceptable conduct.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-64"><a href="#para2-64" name="para2-64">2.64</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Another trend emerging from the evidence considered above is that the press tend to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subsume ethical considerations within an assessment of legal risk. This type of reasoning</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">process was encapsulated in the explanation provided by Mr Desmond which follows his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">answer about ethics and identifies the approach taken at his titles:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think that we are in a business to give readers/viewers what they want to read and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">watch and as long as it is legal that is what we aim to do. We do not talk about ethics</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or morals because it is a very fine line and everybody&#8217;s ethics are different. However,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we do of course care about the title&#8217;s reputation and so we would not run a story if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we thought it would damage that or seriously affect someone&#8217;s life.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">One of the consequences of this approach was that legality, or in some cases, the risk of being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sued, became the touchstone of acceptable conduct. A number of editors and executives</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gave evidence that they would be more likely to engage in conduct which might amount to a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">civil wrong if they knew that the subject of a story or photograph was not likely to bring a civil</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">action. This was to some extent evident in the evidence provided by Mail on Sunday editor,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Peter Wright, who said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Sometimes [duty lawyers] are overcautious, and in particularly on celebrity stories,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you have to take a view to &#8211; we&#8217;re talking about libel here &#8211; there are certain</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">individuals who are very likely to sue and other individuals who, for whatever reason,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are very unlikely to sue, and because I&#8217;ve been doing this job for a very long time, I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">may have a better knowledge of that than the duty lawyer. The duty lawyer will point</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">out to me, &#8220;Look, this could be &#8211; there could be a risk here&#8221;, and it&#8217;s their job to point</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">out the risk. It&#8217;s my job to take the decision.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-66"><a href="#para2-66" name="para2-66">2.66</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The prioritisation of the management of legal liability over ethical risk was present in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legal departments of some newspapers. Senior lawyers who gave evidence to the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">narrowly defined the scope of their responsibilities to exclude any comment on ethical risk</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as opposed to legal risk and liability. This was particularly evident in the legal department at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NI. Lawyers would not advise about the legality of methods used to obtain information,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup> nor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would they advise on the PCC Code which was an editorial matter.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup> Their remit focused on all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aspects of libel law and the legal risks attendant on defamation; dealing with post publication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints; and copyright complaints.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup> The position was the same at Express Newspapers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref49" href="#footnote49">49</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-67"><a href="#para2-67" name="para2-67">2.67</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The consequences of the focus on legality over ethics were eloquently captured in the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence of Mr Peppiatt. He commented on the distinction between a legal and a moral</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sense of truth:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The legal sense of truth is sort of: what can we get away with saying? That&#8217;s sort</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the legal sense. The moral sense would be more: what would be a fair way to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">represent this? What would be an accurate way to represent this? Now, tabloid</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapers have no interest in the moral sense. All they want to do is think: what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">can we get away with saying? How far with we push the boundaries and get away</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with it? As you see when you have these monsterings of people, it&#8217;s sort of: how far</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with we push it? If one newspaper pushes the line, everyone rushes to fill the void</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">behind them. It&#8217;s just a matter of: what can we get away with saying? There&#8217;s no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consideration of: what are the ethics? What are the moral considerations?&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">It appears that sometimes the fact that conduct was legally permissible became an excuse</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not to probe whether conduct was also morally acceptable. This is particularly so in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to libel (can we prove it is true?) as distinct from privacy (does it transgress Article 8 rights?)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although the latter is increasing in prominence as the law has had to deal with an increasing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of complaints in this area.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">Anotherdamagingtendencywas,andis,foreditorstomeasuretherectitudeoftheirreporting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">against the conduct of their competitors. A number of editors and journalists, when asked to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justify some of the more egregious examples of misconduct discussed in this Report, relied</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">heavily on the fact that other titles were printing the stories.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-70"><a href="#para2-70" name="para2-70">2.70</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For example, Mr Desmond would not accept that Mr Hill behaved unethically in relation to his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stewardship of the coverage of the McCann story. When asked whether he agreed that it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">up to the editor not to behave in such a way, he replied<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;No,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> at</span><span style="font-style:italic"> all.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Every</span><span style="font-style:italic"> paper</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8211;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> didn&#8217;t</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for that period of time was talking about the McCanns. It was the hot story &#8211; it was the story.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">51</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-71"><a href="#para2-71" name="para2-71">2.71</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hill was likewise unrepentant about the coverage of the McCann case. He justified it as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref52" href="#footnote52">52</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;My decision was made because I believed that the stories were true and that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">readers of The Daily Express had an interest in them. The Daily Express was not the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">only medium that published offending stories. They appeared widely in the press and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on every TV station. I have never made up a story or asked anyone else so to do. Of</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">course, if there is a big story, there is also pressure to get the best lines because it is a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">highly competitive industry. However, that does not mean that journalists will invent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">stories and that newspapers will print made up stories.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-72"><a href="#para2-72" name="para2-72">2.72</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is notable that his justification again relied heavily on the fact that other titles were printing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the stories, as if that in itself provided a basis for vindicating the accuracy of the story. Editor-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in-Chief of Associated Newspapers, Paul Dacre, whilst accepting that errors had been made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the reporting of Mr Jefferies&#8217; case, emphasised that coverage by the Daily Mail was less</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offensive than at many other titles.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup> In this respect, he agreed with the suggestion that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there is a snowball effect that impacts on the way in which other newspapers<span style="font-size: 14px;"> report</span><span style="font-size: 14px;"> the</span><span style="font-size: 14px;"> same</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the McCann story:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think looking back there was obviously the odd article that we regretted. I think &#8211;</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;[T]his was the most extraordinary story. There have only been two or three in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my lifetime. You could actually see, when you got the circulation reports of other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapers that week, people putting the McCanns on the front pages, their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">circulations went up. I remember the rows and recrimination in our offices that we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">weren&#8217;t carrying these stories. Well, in retrospect, I&#8217;m glad we didn&#8217;t carry those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">stories.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref56" href="#footnote56">56</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-74"><a href="#para2-74" name="para2-74">2.74</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP, characterised the combined effect of some of these factors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as amounting to or creating a &#8216;race to the bottom in standards&#8217;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref57" href="#footnote57">57</a></sup> No doubt he was deploying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all his rhetorical skills to make his point, but putting the same point another way and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">certainly somewhat less aggressively, it must be accepted that there is not a race to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">top. The combined effect of the predominance of commercial considerations, the lack of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear ethical direction from the top, the subordination of ethical considerations to legal risk,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the element of moral relativism involved in seeking to justify one&#8217;s own conduct with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reference to what others were doing at the same time, gives rise to the strong suspicion that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethical practice was not always given the central position it deserved within the culture of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significant section of the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-75"><a href="#para2-75" name="para2-75">2.75</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Aside from the issue of leadership, that of internal governance also falls to be addressed.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The point has already been made that governance within newspapers has a tendency to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">informal and personality based. Given the nature of this type of business, much will always</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">depend on the personal qualities of those at the top of the organisation, and it is understood</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">that proprietors in search of profit in a declining market will naturally enough be tending</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to focus on the commercial and charismatic qualities of their editors, in particular on their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ability to enhance the saleability of their product. That said, it is clear from some of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence received by the Inquiry from those in senior editorial and management positions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that a high value is placed on the maintenance of ethical standards in certain sections of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press, and on that basis there is no reason why this level of practice should not be capable of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being replicated across the board.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-76"><a href="#para2-76" name="para2-76">2.76</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Proper internal governance also involves the creation and implementation of systems of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards, training, supervision, audit and review. In most titles the evidence pointed to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">existence of systems which may fairly be described as informal and cursory. Many editors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have informed the Inquiry that in a fast-moving news and current affairs environment it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be quite unrealistic to expect anything more formal, still less the imposition of systems</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which would entail undue bureaucracy and sclerotic decision making. I am not proposing this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sort of regime because I too understand the practical realities as well as the obvious risk that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">going too far would be counter-productive. Nonetheless, it is clear to me that more could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and should be done to ensure that potentially problematic cases are addressed in a more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">structured manner with key decisions recorded, with short reasons given, in order both to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">improve the decision making process and enhance accountability.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-77"><a href="#para2-77" name="para2-77">2.77</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have already made the point that much of the content of newspapers is uncontroversial in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the sense that it does not create significant legal and ethical risks. I also fully understand and</span>

<a name="page735"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">appreciate that the majority of celebrity reporting is based on information provided directly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the individuals themselves, or by their agents. However, experienced editors, sub-editors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and lawyers must develop an accurate sense of which stories are likely to test the boundaries</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of legal and ethical reporting, and, in any event, systems should be in place to assess risk in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these respects. For example, the &#8216;big&#8217; stories which attracted a significant proportion of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">time and attention of this Inquiry quite obviously fell in that category even before they ever</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">saw the light of day; and the same applies, albeit to a lesser extent, to many of the smaller</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories which the Inquiry has examined.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-78"><a href="#para2-78" name="para2-78">2.78</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Equally, and in this regard it is appropriate to speak very generally, stories which appear to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been obtained by surreptitious means are likely to attract greater risk. I believe that had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more time been taken in these instances for discussion about both the legal and ethical risks,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the quality and reliability of the sources, with that discussion noted contemporaneously</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for review and audit after the event, it is probable that far fewer of these objectionable stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would ever have been published. Furthermore, the implementation of systems which require</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a greater element of formality and accountability is likely to lead in the longer-term to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fostering of a culture which is both more risk averse and more respectful of the legitimate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private rights of individuals.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-79"><a href="#para2-79" name="para2-79">2.79</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, I would also like to add a word on journalism training. I have not sought to look at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the adequacy of the training available to, or provided to, journalists. However, a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of professors of journalism have given evidence to the Inquiry and it is apparent from their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence that the schools of journalism are committed to offering high quality training in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which ethical journalism plays a full part. Largely as a result of the financial pressures on</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">parts of the press, journalism training is increasingly moving away from newsrooms and into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the universities. There is also an important role for ongoing in house training, including in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to new laws and ethical or compliance issues that are highlighted by particular cases.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of titles have told the Inquiry that they work with the PCC to deliver training on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specific issues as appropriate. It is clearly important that the industry generally, and employers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in particular, should place a high priority on training to ensure,<span style="font-style:italic"> inter</span><span style="font-style:italic"> alia</span> , that all journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understand the legal and ethical context within which they work.</span>

<a name="section3"></a>
<h2>3. The relevance of the internet</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Many editors and commentators have argued that the burgeoning of the internet is likely to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">render irrelevant much of the work of the Inquiry even assuming that it has not already done</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so. If, for example, celebrity X&#8217;s privacy is violated online, then the metaphorical cat is well</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out of the bag, and there is no reason why open season should not exist in the printed media.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A clear exemplification of that argument is the justification used by The Sun in relation to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prince Harry photographs, discussed in Chapter 5.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In my view, this argument is flawed for two reasons. Putting to one side publications such as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Mail Online which bind themselves voluntarily to the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice (and which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is legitimately proud of the world-wide on line readership that it has built up), the internet</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does not claim to operate by any particular ethical standards, still less high ones. Some have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">called it a &#8216;wild west&#8217; but I would prefer to use the term &#8216;ethical vacuum&#8217;. This is not to say</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for one moment that everything on the internet is therefore unethical. That would be a gross</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mischaracterisation of the work of very many bloggers and websites which should rightly and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fairly be characterised as valuable and professional. The point I am making is a more modest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one, namely that the internet does not claim to operate by express ethical standards, so that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bloggers and others may, if they choose, act with impunity.</span>
<a name="page736"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The press, on the other hand, does claim to operate by and adhere to an ethical code of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conduct. Publishers of newspapers will be (or, at least, are far more likely to be) far more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">heavily resourced than most, if not all, bloggers and websites that report news (as opposed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to search engines that direct those on line to different sites). Newspapers, through whichever</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">medium they are delivered, purport to offer a quality product in all senses of that term.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although in the light of the events leading to the setting up of this Inquiry and the evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have heard, the public is entitled to be sceptical about the true quality of parts of that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">product in certain sections of the press, the premise on which newspapers operate remains</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">constant: that the Code will be adhered to, that within the bounds of natural human error</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">printed facts whether in newsprint or online will be accurate, and that individual rights will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be respected. In contrast, the internet does not function on this basis at all. People will not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assume that what they read on the internet is trustworthy or that it carries any particular</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assurance or accuracy; it need be no more than one person&#8217;s view. There is none of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">notional imprimatur or kitemark which comes from being the publisher of a respected</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">broadsheet or, in its different style, an equally respected mass circulation tabloid.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second reason largely flows from the first. There is a qualitative difference between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">photographs being available online and being displayed, or blazoned, on the front page of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper such as The Sun. The fact of publication in a mass circulation newspaper multiplies</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and magnifies the intrusion, not simply because more people will be viewing the images, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also because more people will be talking about them. Thus, the fact of publication inflates the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apparent newsworthiness of the photographs by placing them more firmly within the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">domain and at the top of the news agenda. As Professor Baroness Onora O&#8217;Neill made clear<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref58" href="#footnote58">58</a></sup> ,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is important:</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;to recognise the extent to which exposure to media content is unchosen &#8211; particularly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by children, those in institutional settings, and those in public places. Regulation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should have regard to the realities of media penetration rather than assuming that it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">always reflects consumer choices.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ultimately, this is most decidedly not a debate about free speech. A newspaper&#8217;s right</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to publish what it chooses within the general law (whether or not it complies with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Editors&#8217; Code) is not in question, although within a more robust regulatory framework the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consequences of a breach of the Code, publication having occurred, might well be such as to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have a deterrent effect. To turn this into a debate about free speech both misses the point</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and is in danger of creating the sort of moral relativism which has already been remarked on.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is, or at least should be, a debate about freedom with responsibility, and about an ethical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press not doing something which it is technically quite able to do but decides not to do. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">freedom (and where the editors choose to draw the line whether rightly or otherwise) was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">neatly encapsulated by the decisions taken in relation to Prince Harry and the Duchess of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cambridge.</span>

<h2>4. The press response to this inquiry</h2>

<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Our free press has been and is entitled to comment as it chooses on the work of this Inquiry,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and although I am equally entitled to exercise my own right of free speech, I am firmly of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view that it is not for me to reflect any commentary back onto the press. However, it is right</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that I make an observation on one matter.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref58" name="footnote58" title="Go back to footnote reference 58 in the text">58</a>.  p6, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Witness-Statement-of-Professor-Baroness-ONeil.pdf</p><!--footnote-->

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The publicist, Max Clifford was asked to comment on the effect, if any, that the Inquiry and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the general public mood were having on the current work of the press. He said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Do you have any feel for what&#8217;s going on at the moment? Has the scandal which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">broke last summer had a chilling effect on the types of methods which are being used</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">now to obtain stories?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I mean hopefully yes, I mean, it&#8217;s frightened people and made them stop those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">kind of things, which is what I believe and sincerely hope, but also the effect of this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Inquiry, I think, has frightened editors, so, you know, for example, in recent months</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there&#8217;s several major stories which would have dominated the headlines that I&#8217;m</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">aware of which haven&#8217;t come out.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. I don&#8217;t want you on that topic to say anything which would invade any individual&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">privacy, but can you give us some idea of what exactly it is which is holding editors</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">back from publishing the sort of story you have just mentioned?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Well, I think it&#8217;s a backlash. It&#8217;s a public backlash. I mean, what really got the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">British public angry was Milly Dowler and the McCanns, wasn&#8217;t it? People like that.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">You know, stars having their phones tapped, people like myself that are successful,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wealthy, have done very, very well out of the media or films, television, so what,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">those people don&#8217;t care, they have far more important things to worry about. But</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">when they read and heard about Milly Dowler, when they read and press. It&#8217;s the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">best chance anybody&#8217;s got, otherwise we&#8217;re like Chinese and Russians and just slaves</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the system. But are they savage? Can they be savage? Absolutely right. Of course</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">some of the most successful papers are the most savage because an awful lot of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people would much rather read nasty things about other people than nice things.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have no hesitation in accepting the way in which Mr Clifford characterises the present</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">position. He gave his evidence in a forthright manner and had no reason or motive to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mislead the Inquiry. I do not interpret his evidence as suggesting that press conduct has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exemplary since July 2011, and that in any event would not accord with my own experience:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indeed, three of the case studies as discussed earlier,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup> post date the commencement of this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry, and, whatever view might be taken of these stories, indicate that the chilling effect of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry (if it exists at all) is limited.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If, as appears likely, the press, or certain sections of the press, have exercised a substantial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">measure of self-restraint for the reasons explained by Mr Clifford or otherwise, I do have to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ask myself what will happen after this Report has been published and memories begin to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fade. I have little hesitation in concluding that, unless something is done about it, the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would fairly speedily revert to type: in other words, it would start printing the sort of stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to which Max Clifford has alluded. It is not difficult to come to such a conclusion given the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">history of self-regulation of the press, and the lessons to be derived from that. Part D Chapter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1 of the Report recalled the cyclical nature of press self-regulation. In the aftermath of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">three Royal Commissions, the Younger Report, Sir David Calcutt QC&#8217;s two reports, and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">death of Princess Diana, the press has shown signs of reform and signs of self-improvement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only to regress in the years that follow, prompting the need for a further Royal Commission,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public inquiry or similar. The fact is that many of the root causes of the problems in the culture</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and ethics of the press (in particular, commercial pressures in a declining market-</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the problems identified are unlikely to be eliminated by self-control.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is not to be interpreted as an altogether pessimistic message. There are many who argue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it would be a mistake to swim against the tide of human nature. That viewpoint may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or may not be correct in other contexts, but in my view it does not apply in the present. A</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">laissez faire<span style="font-style:normal"> approach</span><span style="font-style:normal"> would</span><span style="font-style:normal"> carry</span><span style="font-style:normal"> with</span><span style="font-style:normal"> it</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span><span style="font-style:normal"> pessimistic</span><span style="font-style:normal"> message,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> but</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> is</span><span style="font-style:normal"> both</span><span style="font-style:normal"> negative</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unrealistic. The real problem which I believe exists within the culture, practices and ethics</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press justifies, if not demands, a more robust system of independent press regulation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which is capable of addressing that problem head on.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Not merely would such a system have the obvious benefit of meeting the immediate needs of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those who have suffered at the hands of the press, it would also bring about, incrementally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and over the course of time, lasting change within the culture, practices and ethics of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press to a point when it would no longer be appropriate to speak of practices which are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cultural. Instead, we would have arrived at a state of affairs in which any failings or lapses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would indeed be isolated and straightforward examples of frank human error or, as one press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">core participant has put it, &#8216;unadorned errors of judgment&#8217; which would not be evidence of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sub standard culture or practices.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-7"><a href="#para4-7" name="para4-7">4.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Putting to one side the current investigations, the clearest message which comes out of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">entirety of this lengthy part of the Report addressing the culture, practices and ethics of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press overall is that, time and time again, there have been serious and uncorrected failures</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">withinpartsofthenational pressthatmayhavestretchedfromthecriminaltotheindefensibly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unethical, from passing off fiction as fact to paying lip service to accuracy. In doing so, far</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">from holding power to account, in these regards the press is exercising unaccountable power</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which nobody holds to account. In my view, the maintenance of the status quo is simply not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an option; the need for change in internal but most importantly in external regulation has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been powerfully identified.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-8"><a href="#para4-8" name="para4-8">4.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is a corollary point which I also wish to emphasise. Lord Black told the Inquiry that in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his view the phone hacking scandal by itself was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;[i]n</span><span style="font-style:italic"> terms</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> architecture</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> system...</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the most obvious example of why urgent reform of the system is needed&#8217;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref61" href="#footnote61">61</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Lord</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Black</span><span style="font-style:normal"> did</span><span style="font-style:normal"> not</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provide any further examples justifying the need for urgent reform, but the lengthy pages</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of this Part of the Report most certainly do. It has not been my purpose or endeavour to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apportion blame but it has been necessary to set out the substantial, if not overwhelming,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">weight of evidence which not merely justifies but requires regulatory form in a manner which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meets public expectations and the public interest. In my view the case for such reform has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been proven many times over.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-9"><a href="#para4-9" name="para4-9">4.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having made this fundamental point strongly as I am able, I return to what I said at the very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">start of Part F of the Report. I recognise the constitutional important of free speech within the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context of a responsible press, and I also recognise that most of what the press does is good</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalism free from the sort of vices I have had to address at length. No one reading this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Report in full should come away with the impression that the press as an industry is shot to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pieces. It is not; but at the same time as acknowledging that, I also state and repeat that what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has come out of the investigation that this Chapter of the Report summarises demonstrates</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it is essential that the need for a fresh start in press regulation is fully embraced, and a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">new regime thereafter implemented.</span>
