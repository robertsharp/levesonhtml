<h1>CHAPTER 1<br/>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Overview</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whether published every day, every week or every month, the press produce a vast amount</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of reading material covering an enormous range of topics. The daily and weekly papers will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cover &#8211; in no particular order &#8211; news, politics, investigations, foreign affairs, business, sport,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">culture (including books, art, film and theatre), property, fashion, travel, motoring, personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">finance, entertainment, TV and radio, games and doubtless other topics. There are features</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and opinions, gossip and jokes. They inform and they entertain and they do so very much in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public interest. The overwhelming majority of these topics are attractively covered in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way that undoubtedly appeals to readers.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The reason that the Inquiry has not focussed on what is the overwhelming majority of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">work of journalists is that, in the main, there is no public concern about the way in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">most of these topics have been reported. The culture, practices and ethics of the press that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are of interest to the Inquiry cover only one aspect of the way in which the press goes about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its business. True, there could be arguments about the extent to which a travel journalist or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">food critic should inform the reader that he or she received a discounted or complimentary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">holiday or meal, but such issues are on the very edge of what the Inquiry has been concerned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about. The focus, therefore, has only been on those areas which have been the subject of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criticism; in particular, the way in which parts of the press can deal with individuals without</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">regard to their rights and without regard to the public interest. It must be remembered that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these are individuals who almost invariably do not have the same megaphone to defend</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">themselves or put the contrary view.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Most of the topics covered by the press will never trouble any regulator, whether it is the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press Complaints Commission (PCC) or someone else. As a result, the need for a regulator</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the scope of its authority is not dictated by issues that arise from the vast majority of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories. But that is not the same as saying that there is no need for a regulator. Most doctors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behave impeccably towards their patients but a regulatory mechanism is necessary for those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who do not, whether on a serial basis or because of a single lapse. The need to examine the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criticisms of the press inevitably focuses on those areas that cause difficulty so as to ensure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, whatever the answer to regulation is, it can deal with these issues.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am conscious that focussing on criticisms of the press will cause (and has, indeed, caused)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">many to criticise the Inquiry on the basis that it has been slanted to the poor practices and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has paid insufficient attention to good practices. Piers Morgan, the former editor of the Daily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mirror, for instance, complained at the conclusion of his evidence that a lot of the very good</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">things that newspapers have done and continue to do were not being highlighted by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry. He said it was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;like</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> rock</span><span style="font-style:italic"> star</span><span style="font-style:italic"> having</span><span style="font-style:italic"> an</span><span style="font-style:italic"> album</span><span style="font-style:italic"> brought</span><span style="font-style:italic"> out</span><span style="font-style:italic"> from</span><span style="font-style:italic"> his</span><span style="font-style:italic"> back</span><span style="font-style:italic"> catalogue</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Terms of Reference and its focus on public concerns and complaints rather than on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">successes and achievements of the press. During the course of the Inquiry, I made it clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that I did not believe that the culture, practices and ethics of the press were predominantly</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref1" name="footnote1" title="Go back to footnote reference 1 in the text">1</a>.  p110, lines 10-22, Piers Morgan, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-20-December-2011.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page439"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">sub-standard or worthy of criticism. In my view the majority of editors, journalists and others</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who work for both the national and regional press do good work in the public interest, as well</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as entertaining their readers. I have no doubt that the press can take pride in most of its work.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, good practices do not require a public inquiry and do not require regulation. They</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also take less time to define, describe and substantiate, and can be cast in a way that is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">entirely uncontroversial. It takes far more time and space to consider and analyse the extent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to which complaints and criticisms are well-founded, and to identify the mechanisms that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be available to encourage all that is good while discouraging that which is properly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">capable of criticism. As a consequence, this important Part of the Report starts, at Chapter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2, with a recognition of the enormous value that the press plays in our daily life, and notes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that for all of the examples of poor practice cited below, there are many more examples of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">good practice. However, having said that, the rest of this Part of the Report focuses on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns and complaints that have been made and expressed, along with the ways in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they have or have not been adequately addressed. It would be entirely wrong to view the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of words expended in this Report on the good versus the bad as reflecting any overall</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">judgment. The nature of my task is to focus on those aspects of press culture, practices and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethics (even if in small pockets) which leave something to be desired. Inevitably, the focus is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">overwhelmingly on poor practice rather than good.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. Module one and the Terms of reference</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This Part of the Report examines the evidence the Inquiry has received relating to &#8216;the Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the Public&#8217;, in other words, the first of the four modules into which the work of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry was conveniently allocated.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Terms of Reference do not specifically mention &#8216;the public&#8217; (cf. politicians and the police)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but it is obvious that any inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the press must</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigate all the respects in which press conduct and behaviour (nouns which do appear in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the express wording) impact on those who feature predominantly in the work of newspapers,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in other words &#8216;the public&#8217;. Indeed, owing to the nature of the concerns which directly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">triggered the setting up of the Inquiry, I decided to bring &#8216;the public&#8217; into the heart of the first</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">module. The relationships between the press and the police, and the press and politicians,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">naturally give rise to slightly different issues which could best be addressed after Module</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">One.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The terminology &#8211; the &#8216;culture, practices and ethics&#8217; of the press &#8211; was the subject of analysis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by Counsel to the Inquiry in opening Module One in November 2011, and submissions by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Core Participants. The analysis of Robert Jay QC was as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It may be helpful to take those three terms together. We are looking at practices</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which may be widespread rather than isolated and sporadic. Practices which may</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be widespread, insofar as they are bad practices, may well flow from systems which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are broken and/or from attitudes and mores which are dysfunctional. The more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we may see patterns of behaviour and practices which are generic, and the more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">widespread they are, the more it may be possible to infer the existence of broken</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">systems, dysfunctional attitudes and mores; and, overall, the existence of a culture</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which tends to explain why these problems are occurring in the first place.&#8221;</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref2" name="footnote2" title="Go back to footnote reference 2 in the text">2</a>.  p19, lines 3-14, Robert Jay, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-14-November-2011.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page440"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further, in my ruling on the Application of Rule 13 of the Inquiry Rules 2006, I said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Turning from the general to the specific, it is first necessary to consider the Terms</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of Reference which clearly visualise &#8216;the press&#8217; as capable of being a sufficiently</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">homogeneous group to allow analysis of its culture, practices and ethics even if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(as is undoubtedly the case) different titles and different types of newspaper will</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or may exhibit different or slightly different approaches to them. Nobody, however,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">has suggested that the legal or ethical approach should be different even if the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pressures, the likely impact of ethical considerations on the type of story sought and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the willingness to take risks might be. Having said that, it is clear that an isolated</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">act of criminal or unethical behaviour would not, of itself, represent the culture or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">constitute a practice of &#8216;the press&#8217;. Subject to a practice being sufficiently widespread</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to constitute evidence of a culture or practice of the press, however, there is no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">question of it being necessary to quantify that practice and, in any event, I will need</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to consider the extent to which the picture is built up inferentially and cumulatively.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These broad interpretations, which in my view make the same points in different ways, have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been my guiding principles throughout this Inquiry. Thus, the endeavour throughout has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been to focus on the generic or, more precisely, what might on first examination be evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bearing on the culture, practices and ethics of the press overall. On occasion, I have come</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the conclusion that evidence which had the appearance of exemplifying this core issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within my Terms of Reference did not, in fact, demonstrate any generic failing, but rather was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indicative of the isolated or wayward. On other occasions, I have rejected the submissions of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Core Participants that I should conclude that some failing was a &#8216;one-off&#8217; and have decided</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it was, in fact, illustrative of a wider problem. Throughout, I have had regard to a possible</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">broader picture without pre-judging the issue: whether or not a piece of evidence is truly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">part of the jigsaw has depended on assessing that evidence in its own terms and then more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">widely; but the point to be reiterated and fully understood is that the shape and nature of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the jigsaw did not come into sharp and clear relief until the end of the Inquiry, after all the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence had been assessed and analysed.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are three further points I would like to make at this stage. First, although I recognise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the inherent difficulties, there are clear practical reasons why the press should be considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a broad entity rather than as a series of individual print titles. This, as I have already stated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in my ruling of 1 May 2012<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> , is not the same as saying that &#8216;the culture&#8217; at each newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is exactly the same. Journalists move from newspaper to newspaper, and the commercial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressures I explore below are similar across the industry as a whole; I recognise that some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers are more profitable than others and that newspapers vary in respect of the sort</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of stories they like to print. Furthermore, the industry is fairly closely-knit in the sense that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers competing with one another tend to have a fair idea of what their colleagues or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">competitors are up to.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, although the Terms of Reference are not worded so as to pre-judge the issue, it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear that those who participated in their formulation were of the view that the culture,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and ethics of the press left something to be desired. Thus, paragraph 1d of the Terms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Reference refers to &#8216;media misconduct&#8217; (in the context of previous warnings), paragraph</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2a to a &#8216;new more effective policy and regulatory regime&#8217; (implying that the existing regime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is ineffective to address the problem), and paragraph 2b to &#8216;future concerns about press</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref3" name="footnote3" title="Go back to footnote reference 3 in the text">3</a>.  para 46, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Application-of-Rule-13-of-the-Inquiry-Rules-2006.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref4" name="footnote4" title="Go back to footnote reference 4 in the text">4</a>.  http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Application-of-Rule-13-of-the-Inquiry-Rules-2006.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page441"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">behaviour&#8217; (implying that press misbehaviour is a current concern). Plainly, the Terms of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Reference require me to describe and characterise press conduct and, where appropriate,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to identify causes: in other words, fully to diagnose the problem before potential solutions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and remedies are recommended. Given what had been revealed at the News of the World</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(NoTW), that may not be surprising but it is important to underline that I have approached</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this exercise with an open mind, and not on the basis that the explicit and implicit premises</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Terms of Reference do not require independent validation by me.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Third,andapointwhichagainflowsdirectlyfromanexaminationoftheTermsofReference,my</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations must support<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> integrity</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> freedom</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> press...while</span><span style="font-style:italic"> encouraging</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the Inquiry must do its best to foster a free press which has integrity as well as ethical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards: indeed, the highest ethical and professional standards. Many commentators</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have focused on the importance of a free press (which I would be the first to recognise and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">uphold) without any reference to the need for an ethical press to possess integrity. These</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are demanding standards and require ethical judgments to be made at all material times:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">merely to broadcast the values of &#8216;freedom&#8217; is seriously to overlook a complementary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and equally important set of values, and to run the danger of creating or permitting that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which is undesirable and not in the public interest. In my view, the unification of these twin</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requirements &#8211; freedom and ethics &#8211; is not an impossible aspiration: both may co-exist in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the same press, working in harmony and in cooperation with each other. But the recognition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the need for an ethical press inevitably carries with it the recognition of the need for a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsible press, which respects the rights and interests and others, and which does not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regard &#8216;freedom&#8217; as the ultimate panacea or touchstone for its mores and conduct.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As a final point, I should note that many of the arguments made in respect of the rights or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wrongs of the practices and ethics of the press can turn on one&#8217;s view of the amorphous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concept of the public interest. Many otherwise unethical practices may be made ethical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">simply by virtue of the fact that they are justified, in the circumstances, in the public interest.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For example, covert surveillance and photography of an actress playing with her children</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in a private garden is almost certain to be unethical; by contrast, the covert surveillance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and photography of drug dealers supplying heroin (in the equivalent of a back garden) is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">almost undeniably ethical and entirely in the public interest. As such, the Terms of Reference</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">do require me, when assessing the culture, practices and ethics of the press, to engage in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">questions relating to the public interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There can be many reasonable views of what is, or is not, in the public interest. In line with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">judicial authority, it is not for me to impose my own conception as the correct and only one:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the judgment of editors and journalists should be given significant weight.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> But that does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not mean that journalists and editors have free rein to define the public interest however</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they choose. It is clear, as most (but not all) have fully recognised, that the public interest is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">something quite different from simply what interests the public.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">and 9 February 2012, closing with supplementary evidence from Paul Dacre. However, as I</span>

<a name="page442"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">have explained, the modules do not form hermetically sealed caskets and further evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant to Module One was adduced at later stages.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The body of evidence received by the Inquiry is vast, both in terms of its volume and scope, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it will not be possible to deal with all of it in this Report. To do so would create a sprawling and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">overly cumbersome narrative which would imbalance the Report as a whole, lack appropriate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">focus and, in consequence, fail to do justice to the Terms of Reference. Instead, I adopt a more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">focused, thematic and analytical approach which serves to find the right balance between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indiscriminate citation of the evidence on the one hand and overly boiling down the material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the other. My overriding goal is, and always has been, to set out a sufficient narrative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which enables everyone to understand the basis of my generic conclusions in relation to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">culture, practices and ethics of the press; and, even more saliently, my recommendations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as to a new regulatory regime. Even adopting this more tailored approach, I recognise that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there will inevitably be elements of duplication and overlap. This is largely for two reasons:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">first, certain pieces of evidence may be relevant to more than one generic conclusion, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">second because there is more than one way of approaching, narrating and analysing the key</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">elements of the story. My different angles of approach will sometimes require me to recruit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the same evidence for slightly different purposes.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Module One saw evidence given by a range of people, chosen to provide as complete a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">picture as possible on the relationship between the press and the public. Those witnesses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">broadly fell into categories as described below.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, the Inquiry heard from 21 witnesses from across British society, each with a different</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal story to tell about their adverse treatment by parts of the press. As more fully</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained below, some of the witnesses may fairly be described as &#8216;celebrities&#8217;; others were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals who would challenge that characterisation and say that they do not seek out fame</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or media celebrity as such but find their way into the public eye only because they are good at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what they do (whether it be acting, singing, writing, playing sports); others have featured in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press because they are unfortunate enough to be the victims of crime, or otherwise have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been associated with notorious crime; and yet others have been ordinary people who have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attracted press interest for whatever reason. Thus, the witnesses occupied a disparate range</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of occupations and social groups, and no one could fairly say that they were all celebrities,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">still less that they openly courted publicity and should therefore accept the rough with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">smooth.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although most witnesses were required both to make statements and to give evidence by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reason of a notice issued under s21 of the Inquiries Act 2005, these witnesses (all of whom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were speaking about intensely personal experiences) were not. They were self-selected</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from among the Core Participants who complained about press intrusion. As I have made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear, in the main, their evidence was not subjected to detailed probing by Counsel to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry and, in accordance with my direction, there was no cross-examination by the other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Core Participants, although they did suggest questions (which Counsel generally then felt it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate to ask) and were, additionally, allowed (if not encouraged) to put in evidence in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rebuttal if so advised. Accordingly, the Inquiry recognises that some of this evidence was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fully tested for its reliability and credibility in a manner which would have been appropriate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had it been essential to reach findings of fact at a granular level. Nonetheless, nobody has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggested that the majority of the evidence received by those witnesses was anything other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than reliable and so, as a whole, it casts important light on the broad issue of the culture,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and ethics of the press.</span>
<a name="page443"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, the Inquiry heard evidence from journalists and commentators who had written</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about their experience of the culture, practices and ethics of the press. Those critical of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press standards included Richard Peppiatt, a former journalist, and Alastair Campbell, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">former Director of Communications for No 10. At the other extreme end of the spectrum was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Paul McMullan who rejoiced in an anarchical view of the approach to any standards within</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press. In the middle, there were others whose evidence, on the face of their witness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statements, was more favourable to the press, but who also needed to be probed and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">tested not least as they moved away from prior published statements on the subject matter.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Witnesses in this category included Mr Morgan and Sharon Marshall, a former journalist with</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">the NoTW.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Third, the Inquiry heard evidence from each of the national titles in England and Wales,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some magazines and similar publications, and also from a sample of regional titles and those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publishing in the devolved administrations. In the time available it was not possible to do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other than hear from a representative sample of journalists in order to give me a flavour of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the position, although it should be recorded that the Inquiry did hear in person from virtually</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all the national newspaper editors and proprietors (albeit that the timing of the evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of many of the proprietors was at the start of Module Three not least because they had a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of topics to cover and I wished to ensure that they did not have to appear at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry more than once). Aside from being asked to elaborate on the key points made in their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">detailed witness statements, editors and journalists were asked to address and comment on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examples of the culture, practices and ethics of the press which had come to the Inquiry&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">notice, some exemplifying ostensibly good practice, others less good.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inevitably, the Inquiry&#8217;s most detailed consideration was reserved for what may be called</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the &#8216;really big stories&#8217;, some of which are addressed as exemplifying facets of the culture,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and ethics of the press below.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> Equally inevitably, the Inquiry in these instances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">heard evidence from the journalists and editors involved: as was made clear at the time, and I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reiterate, the purpose of doing this was not to subject the journalists in particular to personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">censure, but rather to examine what they did (and did not do) for the light it was capable of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">throwing on the general picture. That said, I fully understand that the experience of giving</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence before a televised public inquiry could not always have been a pleasant one for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press witnesses concerned: the Inquiry is grateful for their contributions, and notes that, on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all occasions, witnesses were treated with courtesy and consideration.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Fourth, the Inquiry also received evidence in Module One from those involved in electronic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mediaandtheinternet,withaviewtoseekingtounderstandthespecificchallengespresented</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to press regulation generally by the existence of the worldwide web and the burgeoning</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">range of possibilities created by new technology.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-10"><a href="#para3-10" name="para3-10">3.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Fifth, the Inquiry heard evidence from a number of special interest groups bringing different</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perspectives to my deliberations. First, there was a range of groups, such as Trans Media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Watch, ENGAGE and End Violence against Women, who complained about unbalanced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reporting in the press of issues concerning them, and of the failure of the PCC to address</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their concerns. Second, there were other groups, such as English PEN and Index against</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Censorship, who came to the Inquiry with particular perspectives on Article 10, free speech</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and public interest issues. Third, there were organisations such as Full Fact and the Science</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Media Centre, concerned about inaccuracy in press reporting, either generally or in a specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context. This list is not exhaustive, either of the groups who testified or of the issues they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">covered, but it provides a flavour of the range of evidence the Inquiry has been asked to</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref7" name="footnote7" title="Go back to footnote reference 7 in the text">7</a>.  Part F, Chapter 5</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page444"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">take into account: a considerable body of other evidence to like effect but affecting other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interested or concerned groups was read into the record of the Inquiry.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-11"><a href="#para3-11" name="para3-11">3.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sixth, the Inquiry heard from those with experience in the Press Complaints Commission</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(PCC) and the Press Board of Finance (PressBof), covering the existing system of regulation of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press and proposals for the future. The Inquiry heard from the past and current directors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and chairs of the PCC, and the current chair of PressBof, Lord Black. The present chair of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC, Lord Hunt, assisted the Inquiry with the then current state of play regarding the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry&#8217;s proposals for &#8216;self-regulation&#8217; within a new contractual framework, and he returned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to update me on this topic in Module Four.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-12"><a href="#para3-12" name="para3-12">3.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, a different perspective on the approach to stories came from the Information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner and the police. As for the Information Commissioner, the evidence from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Motorman provides a window on the way in which some journalistic investigations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were conducted or information researched (albeit without the knowledge of those affected).</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Its significance is such that it is summarised in Part E, Chapter 3; the position is then subject</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to separate analysis in Part H. As for the police, their investigations are detailed in Part E,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chapters 2, 4 and 5.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-13"><a href="#para3-13" name="para3-13">3.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This short summary scarcely gives the full flavour of the scope, range and scale of the evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry received during the first 40 days of its sitting. The live oral evidence, accompanying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">witness statements and exhibits, and the read-in evidence, including all the documentary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence and submissions, add up to a very substantial mass of material, all of which has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been sifted, read, considered and analysed with a view to drawing the Inquiry&#8217;s generic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusions. Recognising that this burden of material only represents a small proportion of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the evidence which might have been adduced had time and resources been greater, I should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nonetheless record that I believe that the evidence that has been received is sufficient in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terms of its quality and quantity to enable me to discharge my Terms of Reference.</span>
<h4>Evidence from &#8220;the Public&#8221;</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-14"><a href="#para3-14" name="para3-14">3.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As set out above, the Inquiry heard evidence of unethical and damaging press behaviour</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from a broad and representative cross-section of society. Witnesses to the Inquiry have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">included: individuals with a public profile; the victims of crime and indeed those incorrectly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accused of criminality or other wrong-doing by the press; innocent bystanders to events; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals who may themselves be of no obvious in interest to the wider public but for their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">connections to the types of person set out above. These individuals have contributed to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry&#8217;s work either by formally testifying in person or through witness statements which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were read in to the Inquiry record, or through the mechanism of informal submissions to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry from ordinary members of the public made in response to questions published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the Inquiry website. I recognise the obvious limitations inherent in this latter category of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence and, whilst appreciating the contributions which have been made, do not place</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent reliance on this informal material.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-15"><a href="#para3-15" name="para3-15">3.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is wrong to suggest that the public are somehow homogeneous, or that (as some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commentators have suggested) the Inquiry has only heard the complaints of the rich and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">famous. This is not the case: the spectrum of people who claim to have been the victims of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unethical or damaging behaviour by the press and have given their personal accounts to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry is broad.</span>
<a name="page445"></a><!--new page--><h4>People with a public profile</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-16"><a href="#para3-16" name="para3-16">3.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">People with a public profile can be visualised in different ways, depending mainly on how that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">profile arises. Evidently, there are those who occupy positions of power and responsibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in our democracy and who, by virtue of these functions, legitimately attract the interest of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press. Everyone can readily understand and appreciate who falls into this first category</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but, for my part, it is interesting to ask whether press proprietors and editors should be seen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as being part of that group and, if so, how much press attention they personally attract. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should also be emphasised that what I have described as the legitimate interest of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should not be understood as a<span style="font-style:italic"> carte</span><span style="font-style:italic"> blanche</span> to look everywhere: the public&#8217;s right to know is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumscribed by the subject-matter, and a correct appreciation of what the public truly has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a right to know about.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-17"><a href="#para3-17" name="para3-17">3.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;People with a public profile&#8217; also includes those who have become famous as a consequence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of their success in their chosen career or profession. This second sub-group includes (in terms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of those who have testified before me): footballers, such as Garry Flitcroft; musicians, such as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thesingerCharlotteChurch;aswellasfilmandtelevision starssuchasthetelevision presenter,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Anne Diamond, and the actors Sienna Miller and Hugh Grant. These are all individuals in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whom the public is interested as a consequence of the success they enjoy in their chosen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">walks of life, but they are also individuals whose private lives are largely unrelated to their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">professional lives and their careers.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-18"><a href="#para3-18" name="para3-18">3.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As has been frequently pointed out to the Inquiry by the press Core Participants, some within</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this sub-group, but none of those mentioned above, have sought commercial advantage from</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">displaying a particular brand or persona before the public, or have made representations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about themselves for direct or indirect advantage. But one does need to be clear about this,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because just as &#8216;the freedom of the press&#8217; has been pronounced by some as a mantra which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conquers all, so has &#8216;hypocrisy&#8217; been used indiscriminately in support of unjustified intrusions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into the private lives of the famous and the successful. By way of illustrating, but not at this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stage analysing the point, Mr Grant told the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;... I wasn&#8217;t aware I traded on my good name. I&#8217;ve never had a good name. And it&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">made absolutely no difference at all. I&#8217;m the man who was arrested with a prostitute</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the film still made tons of money.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-19"><a href="#para3-19" name="para3-19">3.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further, the writer JK Rowling also told the Inquiry that she most emphatically does not seek</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fame or to benefit from her public persona, yet is still the subject of intense press interest.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-20"><a href="#para3-20" name="para3-20">3.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This category of people with a public profile also includes a third sub-group: individuals who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are famous only for their celebrity, or put another way the mere fact of their having entered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public eye. These people are those who actively participate in the &#8216;celebrity industry,&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">actively pursuing publicity&#8217;s sake, employing publicists to provide a steady stream of stories to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press and to inform paparazzi of their whereabouts, in order to ensure that they continue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to appear in the public eye. This sub-group might reasonably be said to include, for example,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some stars of reality television. Certainly in these cases, where the fame of the individual is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">linked to their exposure to the public through the press and other media, the relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between individual and the press, and what is acceptable and what is unethical, is more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nuanced. In such cases the public interest in what might otherwise be private matters may</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">difficult to determine.</span>
<h4>Victims of crime</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-21"><a href="#para3-21" name="para3-21">3.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Members of the public who have been at the receiving end of unethical behaviour by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press also include the victims of crime and individuals who have been linked, either directly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or indirectly, to crimes. To an extent this level of scrutiny is understandable as crime remains</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a key concern for the public and indeed much crime reporting is of the highest standard.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, the Inquiry has heard evidence in relation to some crime reporting, by a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of newspapers, that is alleged to have fallen far short of acceptable standards of behaviour</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in terms of inaccuracy and intrusiveness, sometimes giving rise to concerns of the risk of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prejudicing subsequent criminal proceedings and, in relation to those who are already the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">victims of crime, causing considerable additional harm and distress.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">This category of individual includes those who have been harmed emotionally as well as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suffering damage to their reputations, such as Drs Kate and Gerry McCann whose daughter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Madeleine disappeared when the family was holidaying in Portugal in May 2007. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subsequent coverage of Madeleine&#8217;s disappearance included libellous and highly inaccurate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">articles in a number of newspapers, particularly in The Daily Express which made a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of allegations about the entirely unproven role of Drs Kate and Gerry McCann in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disappearance of their daughter.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-23"><a href="#para3-23" name="para3-23">3.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This sub-category also includes the parents of the murdered school girl Milly Dowler. Bob</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Sally Dowler were subjected to an unwarranted barrage of intense and intrusive media</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">attention.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup> Aside from the well-publicised matters which led to the setting up of this Inquiry,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">moments of intense private grief were captured by photographers and published in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">NoTW.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-24"><a href="#para3-24" name="para3-24">3.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These high-profile cases are far from isolated examples. The Inquiry also heard evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the parents of Diane Watson, who was murdered at school in Glasgow in 1991. In their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence to the Inquiry, Mr and Mrs Watson not only raised the issue of unwarranted and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indeed intrusive press attention but also, like the McCanns, pointed to the highly inaccurate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and sensationalised reporting around their daughter&#8217;s death.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-25"><a href="#para3-25" name="para3-25">3.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Such intense press interest is not restricted to the victims of crime but also extends to those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who have been linked to, or wrongly, accused or suspected of committing, crimes. Christopher</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Jefferies was arrested in relation to the murder of the student Joanna Yeates at the very end</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of 2010 but subsequently was released without charge; he was not merely cleared of any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wrong-doing but proved to have been a victim himself, the subject of disinformation by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">killer intent on avoiding his own responsibility. However, as more fully examined below,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">during the course of the investigation, Mr Jefferies was subjected to a protracted campaign</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of vilification in the press. This saw a significant number of libellous allegations made by a</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be in contempt of court. Indeed, so intense and unpalatable was this press attention that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Jefferies was forced to leave his home and change his appearance.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></span>
<h4>Innocent bystanders</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-26"><a href="#para3-26" name="para3-26">3.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not only individuals with public profiles and the victims of crime who have been the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subject of intense press scrutiny and potentially unethical and damaging reporting. There are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also many other ordinary members of the public who have complained of unwarranted press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attention in a number of different respects. In particular, the Inquiry heard evidence from a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of organisations representing minority, community and societal groups alleging that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals within those groups, or the groups themselves, have attracted inaccurate and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discriminatory press interest. By way of example only, I have already mentioned Trans Media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Watch,acharitableandsupportorganisationwhichrepresentstheinterestsofmembersofthe</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transgender community by in particular monitoring the quality of reporting of newspapers on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transgender issues. Their basic complaint, which will be examined in greater detail below,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup> is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that transgender people are subject to disproportionate and damaging press attention simply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by dint of being members of that group, rather than in consequence of anything they might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have said or done, and because of what they describe as an obsession in parts of the British</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press with &#8216;outing&#8217; members of the transgender community.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-27"><a href="#para3-27" name="para3-27">3.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Individuals who fall into this category do not consist only of members of pre-formed groups.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The category also extends to individuals who may find themselves at the centre of damaging</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">media attention, such as the families of suicides and also suicide victims themselves. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry has heard evidence of intrusive and damaging press attention directed at the grieving</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">families of suicides. In evidence to the Inquiry, the Samaritans describe the damaging and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intrusive nature of press reporting of the suicides of a number of young people in Bridgend</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">over a six month period in 2007 and 2008.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup> During this time, it is argued, the relatives of some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of these young people were not only subject to, sensationalised reporting which propounded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unfounded speculation that they were linked through a cult or death pact, but also turned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their relatives into the subject of newspaper stories.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup></span>
<h4>Those with links to the above</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-28"><a href="#para3-28" name="para3-28">3.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The last category of person to be considered here is broader and perhaps more nebulous;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it covers those who have become the subject of press speculation and attention as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consequence of the links they may have to those groups or types of people described above.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Included in this category are people like the parents of the singer Charlotte Church, who have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been subject at times to intense press attention and a substantial number of intrusive and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hurtful newspaper articles.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup> Media interest in the parents of Ms Church clearly has more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to do with their relationship to their famous daughter than their own actions: such interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would not have arisen otherwise. Another is the mother of Hugh Grant&#8217;s daughter and,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">are not even targeted or explicitly written about but become &#8216;collateral damage&#8217; because of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the suspicions generated by subterfuge.</span>

<a name="section4"></a>
<h2>4. The structure of part F of the report</h2>

<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Turning to the overall contours and direction of this Part of the Report, Chapter 2 summarises</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">my own assessment of the evidence of good press practices, and reflects my view that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press can take pride in most of its work. However, even if the examples of good practice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">represent the vast bulk of the way in which the press works, it cannot be said that there is no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cause for concern.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chapter 3 moves to summarise the aspects of press practices which have given rise to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaint and concern. Standing back from all the evidence that the Inquiry has received over</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the past year, it is possible to discern a number of common themes or complaint headings</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which are set out in summary form in this Chapter before the further analysis which follows.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chapter 3 also summarises the nature of the harm suffered by individuals and by the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at large as a result of unacceptable press practices. It is necessary to assess the impact of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unethical press practices in this way because the benefits of a free press cannot be assessed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in isolation from other considerations: if a free press amounts to a press which, to a greater or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lesser extent, fails to adhere to proper standards of behaviour, the consequences need fully</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be understood.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nobody denies that the poor practices identified in Chapter 3 exist in some form or other,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">although there may well be arguments or debates about the extent to which they prevail (if at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all) in individual titles. It must be remembered, however, that this is a qualitative assessment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">based on more than the odd or exceptional example (what is happening?) rather than a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">quantitative assessment (to what extent and in what particular titles?). When considering</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the success or otherwise of a regulatory regime, that must be the starting point. It is also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">why the submission made by some individual titles (that the conduct of which complaint is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made cannot be brought home to them) simply misses the point: I am required to consider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press as a whole and the fact that any particular title (if it be the case) may never engage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the practices of which complaint is made is irrelevant.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chapter 4 is devoted to the culture at the NoTW, in respects beyond the practice of phone-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking which is addressed elsewhere. I dedicated a week of Inquiry time to this topic in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">December 2011, and, on other occasions, witnesses such as Paul McMullan and Sharon</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Marshall testified in somewhat different ways to the culture at that now defunct title. Given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the goings-on at the NoTW were the immediate trigger to the setting up of this Inquiry,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is appropriate to devote a whole chapter to this issue.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chapter 5 takes a series of what I am calling &#8216;case studies&#8217; &#8211; in truth, some of the most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">egregious stories the Inquiry examined in Module One &#8211; as exemplifications of the unethical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press practices which underpin the core generic conclusions reached in the following chapter,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chapter 6. Accordingly, the case studies should be read not as random or individual instances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of sub-standard press practice but as the exemplars of a wider problem. The fact that a title</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or a journalist is either necessarily identified or is capable of identification in a case study</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should not be taken as meaning that I am seeking to place that title or that journalist in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different category to those responsible for other examples of poor practice given in evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Inquiry.</span>
<a name="page449"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In Chapter 6 I seek to evaluate and analyse, in detail, the evidence of press practices which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have given rise to concern, and to come to what may be called generic conclusions about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the culture, practices and ethics of the press from this critical stand-point. Inevitably, this is a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lengthy chapter. Not merely is the evidence voluminous but the issues which arise from it are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complex and multi-faceted. I should emphasise that in reaching the conclusions I do, I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">paid very careful regard to all the evidence the Inquiry has accumulated as well as the Core</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Participants&#8217; helpful submissions.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-7"><a href="#para4-7" name="para4-7">4.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, in Chapter 7, I draw overall conclusions and seek to identify some of the drivers for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unethical practices within parts of the press. Those drivers include the impact of commercial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressures in a shrinking newspaper market; the specific employment context in a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper titles; and inadequacies in internal governance and leadership at individual titles.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ultimately, the Chapter concludes with a recognition that the unethical practices identified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">throughout the Report require both cultural, as well as systemic, changes within newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">titles. While these changes must come from within newspaper groups, they must also be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">monitored and enforced by a robust and empowered regulator.</span>
