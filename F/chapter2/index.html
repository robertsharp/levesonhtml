<h1>CHAPTER 2<br/>GOOD PRACTICE</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. The value and virtues of the UK press</h2>
<h4>Overview</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This Chapter of the Report will examine what is far too easy to take for granted, namely that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in so many important respects the press is a force for good in British society. This issue is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">capable of being analysed in a number of ways. The first two concern over-arching issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relating to society as a whole. Thus, the very existence of a free press is invaluable in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sense that societies without such a press are invariably totalitarian regimes which do not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and cannot, countenance the type of scrutiny which only an untrammelled Fourth Estate is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">capable of applying. Second, as many Core Participants have pointed out, a free press is the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lifeblood of a mature democracy: it is an invaluable medium for the representatives of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">people to get their message across, and an equally invaluable means both of examining the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political message and holding the messengers to account.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second type of analysis is more pragmatic but no less important; however many times</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was repeated during the course of the Inquiry, it continues to require emphasis. Most of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the work of the press represents good practice rather than bad. Broadly speaking, stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are accurate, informative, well-written and respectful of the rights and interests of others.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further and additional to that point, it is equally important to underline that the press carries</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out a valuable role in entertaining its readers according to their tastes and interests: indeed,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if it failed in this important respect, readers would desert to other newspapers or other forms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of media, including the array of electronic media currently available and ever burgeoning, as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their preferred means of obtaining information.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These features lead to a further point which it is relevant to make in this context (as well as in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other places). However cheap and easy access to online aggregated material, blogs and tweets</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might be, it is to those whose business is the collection, collation, accurate presentation and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">analysis of news, related commentary, current affairs, sports, fashion and entertainment (to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">name but a few) that the public look for informed views. Those who are in that business are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">called journalists and whether they produce their content in print or online, it is vital that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their work continues to be trusted and recognised for the good that, in the main, it does and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the very important contribution that it makes to our society.</span>
<h4>Existence of a free press: its intrinsic value</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The submissions of News International have reminded the Inquiry of an exchange in Sir Tom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Stoppard&#8217;s satire on the British news media,<span style="font-style:italic"> Night</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Day</span> , published in 1978. Milne says to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ruth:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;No</span><span style="font-style:italic"> matter</span><span style="font-style:italic"> how</span><span style="font-style:italic"> imperfect</span><span style="font-style:italic"> things</span><span style="font-style:italic"> are,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> if</span><span style="font-style:italic"> you&#8217;ve</span><span style="font-style:italic"> got</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> free</span><span style="font-style:italic"> press</span><span style="font-style:italic"> everything</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> correctable,</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and without it everything is concealable&#8217;.<span style="font-style:normal"> Ruth</span><span style="font-style:normal"> replies:</span> &#8216;I&#8217;m with you on the free press. It&#8217;s the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapers I cannot stand&#8217;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span></span>

 <p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The point is rightly made that freedom of the press is essential to a free society, and one of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the key hallmarks of societies which are not free is the absence of a free press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> Arguably,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the point can be taken even further: there is a close correlation between press freedom on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the one hand and the extent to which a society may be seen as being open and free on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other. And this is not simply a matter of journalists, editors and proprietors not being held</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the thrall of the Executive: press freedom requires the press to discharge their important</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibilities by being ever-questioning and ever-vigilant, if necessary noisy, iconoclastic,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">irreverent and unruly. It remains to be considered whether, as has been suggested, it is these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">same instincts which may from time to time cause the press to be led astray.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Accordingly, the existence of a free press is valuable in itself and not merely for all the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">benefits it carries with it. It is noteworthy that not one witness suggested anything to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contrary, and that virtually all the witnesses who had come to tell their personal stories of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press misconduct were at pains to explain that they believed in the value of a free press in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its own right. Being free, however, is not the same as insisting on a free for all without any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accountability of any sort.</span>
<h4>Preponderance of good practice over the bad</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although the point has already been made that the Inquiry is not in a position to quantify</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reliably the amount of bad practice perpetrated by the press over the years, and furthermore</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does not need to do so in order properly to reach conclusions about the culture, practices</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and ethics of the press, or a section of the press, the converse is not the case: in other words,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry is able to state with confidence that the majority of press practice is good, if not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very good. The evidential foundation for this conclusion is clear. First, there is the convergent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence received from numerous witnesses over the course of the hearings. Second, there is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the weight of evidence coming from the press Core Participants. Finally, the Inquiry has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">able to make its own assessment of the overall quality of the work of the press over a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of decades: this is based upon its own reading, assisted in this context by the knowledge and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">experience of the Assessors. Given the quantity of newspaper print produced up and down</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the country day in and day out, no doubt running to thousands of pages, it should be obvious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, if the work of the press was not predominantly acceptable, the volume of complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and litigation would be orders of magnitude greater than they have been both historically</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and more recently.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Sun has provided the Inquiry with some hard data which supports this point.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> A large</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue of The Sun may contain 104 pages and 300 individual items, or even more, adding up to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nearly 100,000 items over the course of a year. Of this total, fewer than half a dozen a week</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will result in a complaint to the PCC. Even recognising that stories are not always based on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues that could give rise to complaint and that, even if they do, many of those who might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have wished to complain do not do so (whether out of disenchantment with the PCC or a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reluctance to take on a large and powerful newspaper group), these statistics provide some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">overall support for the proposition that most press practice is good.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This reference to &#8216;good practice&#8217; is intended to cover the work of the press generally, not just</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the work of news desks producing &#8216;hard&#8217; or serious news. For the avoidance of doubt, here</span>


 <span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry has in mind the work of those writing and producing the comment, opinion and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editorial sections of newspapers; the sports pages; the show business and entertainment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pages; the features pages; the business and personal finance columns; the crossword and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">games pages etc. This list is not of course exhaustive, and will vary from print title to print</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">title, but the general point needs to be reiterated and reinforced.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-10"><a href="#para1-10" name="para1-10">1.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further, the term &#8216;good practice&#8217; is also intended to cover a number of different facets</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of journalistic practice. First is the means by which the material for stories is obtained,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigated, researched and tested for its accuracy. Second, there is the intrinsic interest,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">variety, imagination and quality of the stories, varying according to the tastes and interests</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the newspaper&#8217;s readers. Perhaps the most compelling way of making this point is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to record that the majority of newspaper content is stimulating and entertaining for its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">readers, recognising always that reader X may buy a particular paper for its sports coverage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whereas reader Y may be more interested in its comment sections. Public taste is eclectic,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but newspapers are extremely adept in attuning themselves to the viewpoints and various</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interests of the majority of their readers.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-11"><a href="#para1-11" name="para1-11">1.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not inconsistent with the recognition that most of press practice is &#8216;good&#8217; that journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and editors will sometimes make mistakes, including errors of fact and of judgment. Sources,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">even multiple sources, may simply be wrong in a particular case, however right they might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">usually be; journalists might be misled by apparently reliable sources or websites putting out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">incorrect data and information; errors and slips may be made in the heat of the moment,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in order to meet a particular deadline; editorial judgments may be incorrect in a specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">instance notwithstanding that they may usually be entirely sound. Mistakes of this sort are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made in every walk of life and are part and parcel of the human condition: depending on all</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant factors, they may be entirely consistent with good press practice. But whether or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not they exemplify good or bad practice at the end of the day will depend on matters such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as systems for checking information and sources, and the press response when the error is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pointed out, including press willingness to engage with the complainant and sort things out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as quickly as possible.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-12"><a href="#para1-12" name="para1-12">1.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are two aspects of press practice which merit particular mention. First, Lionel Barber,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editor of the Financial Times, emphasised in his evidence that the reputation of his paper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">depended on getting the story right. In the context of financial reporting it may readily be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understood that accuracy has a special premium, or rather that inaccuracy can be especially</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">damaging, but the same general point may fairly be made in relation to the press as a whole.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Newspapers trade on their reputation; their commercial success ultimately must rest upon</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the reputation they build for honesty, reliability and accuracy. This goes beyond the discussion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of serious issues of politics or current affairs. A reader passionately interested in football, for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">example, will think twice about paying the cover price if the paper of his choice consistently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;gets it wrong&#8217; in relation to stories of interest to him or her.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> Further, the reader will come to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">learn in due course whether stories are true or false. It flows from this that newspapers have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">every incentive to be as honest, reliable and accurate as they can.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-13"><a href="#para1-13" name="para1-13">1.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, the Inquiry recognises that journalists often work under the pressure of deadlines,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and in such circumstances simply do not have the luxury of triple-checking sources or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">satisfying themselves to the point that they are sure beyond reasonable doubt that a story</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is true. This is a factor which must be taken into account, although exactly how far the point</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">goes is worthy of careful consideration. For example, however pressing the deadline, a piece</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which would be seriously defamatory if untrue would require careful checking indeed, and</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">in the ordinary course prior notice to the subject, before being published. This is always a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matter of fact and degree, involving the exercise of sound and sensitive judgment.</span>
<h4>Good journalism may also entertain</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-14"><a href="#para1-14" name="para1-14">1.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry fully recognises and understands that not all journalism can or should be &#8216;worthy&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or high-minded. If this were some sort of requirement, or even a desirable objective, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">outcome would be undemocratic and ultimately contrary to the public interest, because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the readers of such a press would not be representative of the range of tastes, educational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attainments and opinions which constitute modern British society.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-15"><a href="#para1-15" name="para1-15">1.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An important section of the press, probably in truth the largest section, must be popular and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">must entertain. Even readers of more highbrow papers are not interested only in serious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">articles; light and entertaining pieces are all part of the overall package. The same naturally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">applies to an even greater extent in relation to the mid-market and tabloid press, and no one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is remotely suggesting that this is an unworthy or inappropriate objective.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-16"><a href="#para1-16" name="para1-16">1.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thus, purely entertaining stories serve at least two functions: first, they have value in their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">own right, and accord pleasure to their readers on their own terms; second, they have a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">corollary function in attracting readers to the newsstand and in maintaining circulation; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the advantageous by-product of both these functions is that readers will participate more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the democratic process by being drawn to the news and comment pages of the paper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which are often skilfully interwoven with the lighter sections and are usually written in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear, compelling, user friendly and pungent style.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-17"><a href="#para1-17" name="para1-17">1.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Journalism which has no value other than the fact that it entertains does not require a public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest justification provided that its processes of research and preparation, as well as its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subject matter, do not impinge on the rights of others. Submissions from a number of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press Core Participants appear to have come close to suggesting that the Inquiry&#8217;s provisional</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view might be that a public interest justification is required for all stories: this is, as I hope</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been made clear, to misunderstand the Inquiry&#8217;s analysis of the issue. A public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justification is required only if rights and interests such as the privacy of private individuals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may be harmed. In all other cases, subject to issues such as accuracy and the like, the press is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both entitled and entirely free to publish what it likes in the way that it likes.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-18"><a href="#para1-18" name="para1-18">1.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">What might or does amount to &#8216;entertainment&#8217; will naturally vary from paper to paper, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no one could or should be remotely prescriptive about this. Here, the issue touches subjective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matters of taste and opinion which, subject to not overstepping various bounds, must lie</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">solely within the editorial judgment of the newspaper in question.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. Some case studies</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At the directions hearing on 3 April 2012, I made the following statement:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;on a number of occasions it has been suggested to me that I have not paid sufficient</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">attention to the good work of the press. Perhaps that&#8217;s an inevitable consequence of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the terms of reference of the Inquiry, but in order that nobody can suggest that I have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">paid insufficient attention to that aspect, I will invite any title that wishes to submit</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what they perceive to be their top five public interest stories over the last few years,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">merely to reflect the other side of the coin.&#8221;</span>

 <p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In this section of the report I will address a selection of the public interest stories drawn</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to my attention by a number of the press Core Participants pursuant to my invitation, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consider some specific pieces of evidence referred to in written submissions as illustrative of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">good practice. Not every title responded to my invitation, and in any event not every story</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will be expressly covered below: some of the campaigns which are relied on as evidence of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;public interest stories&#8217; are not without controversy, and some are ongoing. I will conclude</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this section with the Daily Telegraph&#8217;s MPs&#8217; expenses stories, since much Inquiry time was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">devoted to it from a number of perspectives.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inevitably, I will be drawing attention to the work of individual titles. I see no difficulty in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">doing this because reference to good practice does not engage in any way what I have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">calling the mantra and the self-denying ordinance.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am also drawing heavily on the content and wording of the submissions of the press Core</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Participants. I should accordingly make it clear that by making reference to any particular</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">campaign, I should not be interpreted as passing judgment on the merits of that campaign or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any underlying argument, although I fully recognise the right of the relevant title to campaign</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as it sees fit. Furthermore, it is extremely important that this aspect of the work of the press,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">namely holding public authorities and others to account in ways that an independent mind</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has perceived is in the public interest, is recognised and appreciated. When dealing with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices of sections of the press that I criticise, nothing should be taken to detract from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the role of the press generally to expose wrongdoing, incompetence or inefficiency, and to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">challenge those who make decisions about the way they were reached or basis for them.</span>
<h4>Associated Newspapers Limited</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Daily Mail&#8217;s written submission is that it is a newspaper which champions causes, fights</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">injustice and raises millions from generous readers to help those facing real hardship. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has never been afraid, or frightened, to stand up against injustice, often in difficult or even</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dangerous circumstances.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The following are advanced as examples of public interest campaigns in recent years.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first story advanced by the Daily Mail is the Stephen Lawrence campaign<span style="font-style:italic"> .</span> When the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prime suspects were acquitted in 1997 of Stephen&#8217;s murder in south east London in 1993,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Daily Mail took up the case. A front page proclaimed &#8216;Murderers,&#8217; accused the suspects of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the crime and printed their pictures. Under a headline: &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic"> The</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Mail</span><span style="font-style:italic"> accuses</span><span style="font-style:italic"> these</span><span style="font-style:italic"> men</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> killing.</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">If we are wrong, let them sue us<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8217;,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> paper</span><span style="font-style:normal"> effectively</span><span style="font-style:normal"> challenged</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> suspects</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> sue.</span><span style="font-style:normal"> They</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not. After the abolition of the rule against double jeopardy and new DNA developments,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">earlier this year two of the suspects were found guilty of his murder.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, two years after the 1998 Omagh bombing atrocity, in despair that the killers were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">still at large, devastated families of the 29 people, including the mother of unborn twins who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been killed in the outrage, approached the Daily Mail in a final attempt to win justice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for their loved ones. the Daily Mail, which accused British justice of a<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;shameful</span><span style="font-style:italic"> betrayal</span> &#8217;,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appealed to its readers and received support across the religious and political divide, raising</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#163;1.2 million to fund a landmark civil court action. In June 2009, the family finally succeeded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when a historic Belfast court ruling awarded them more than &#163;1.6 million in damages against</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the four Real IRA terrorists they accused of tearing their lives apart.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The third campaign identified by the Daily Mail concerns compensation for wounded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">servicemen. In 2007, the Daily Mail highlighted the paltry sums given to injured heroes by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Ministry of Defence and launched a campaign focusing on the case of paratrooper Ben</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Parkinson, 24, who lost both legs, the use of one arm, his speech and much of his memory</span>
 <span style="font-size: 15px;">in a mine blast in Afghanistan. After a year of campaigning, the Government announced it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was doubling the maximum pay out to the worst injured; this was followed, in 2010, by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">announcement that compensation for thousands of others badly wounded in the line of duty,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would also be raised, backdated to 2005.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Following the devastating tsunami on Boxing Day 2004, an appeal (&#8216;Flood Aid&#8217;) by the Daily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mail raised nearly &#163;16 million from readers; this was a world record for newspapers. Much</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the money was filtered through the Disaster Emergency Committee, which represents</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">major UK-based charities, but the paper also oversaw the rebuilding of a large state school</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for children of the poor in Galle on Sri Lanka&#8217;s southern coast and the reconstruction of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fishing village in Banda Aceh, together with new boats for fishermen.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Daily Mail has also drawn attention to the many other successful campaigns the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper has run. Just a few of them are Dignity for the Elderly; Osteoporosis; Alzheimer&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">drugs; Prostate Cancer Awareness; The &#163;6 million Kosovo Appeal; the &#163;5.5 million Farm Aid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appeal; The Battle of Britain memorial; Coming Home; and Money Mail&#8217;s campaigns to help</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">readers get compensation from the banks, from the tax man and from Building Societies.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-12"><a href="#para2-12" name="para2-12">2.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It may readily be understood that Associated Newspapers Ltd&#8217;s examples of &#8216;public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalism&#8217; are examples of campaigns which it has pursued with enormous vigour over</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the years, in each case in the public interest and with ultimate vindication. They illustrate a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different facet of the vital public importance of the press, no less important than paradigm</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">illustrations of investigative reporting. Further, some might argue that the Stephen Lawrence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">campaign was not merely fraught with obvious risk, (legal risk being only one potential</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern) but it involved the difficult decision, raising serious public interest issues, as to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether to accuse those who had already faced a criminal trial for a crime as serious as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">murder (the private prosecutions brought by the Lawrence family having collapsed through</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lack of then available evidence). However, Paul Dacre, the editor of the Daily Mail back in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1997 as he is now, explained why he was prepared to support the Lawrence family in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">face of injustice. It must be emphasised that his judgment has been entirely vindicated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by subsequent events, namely the setting up of a public inquiry under the Chairmanship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Sir William MacPherson (along with its conclusions), the conviction of two men and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">maintenance of public awareness of the case and its important ramifications.</span>
<h4>The Guardian</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Appendix A to the Guardian&#8217;s submissions, filed on 23 July 2012, details five recent public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest investigations conducted by Guardian News and Media Ltd.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> I set out these in full.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-14"><a href="#para2-14" name="para2-14">2.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first concerns the death of the newspaper seller, Ian Tomlinson<span style="font-style:italic"> .</span> In the days after the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Tomlinson&#8217;s death, during protests over the G20 summit in April 2009, dogged reporting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the Guardian&#8217;s Paul Lewis raised questions about the police account of the sequence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of events leading up to his collapse. The official account was unpicked when the Guardian</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obtained video footage showing Mr Tomlinson being struck by a police officer before his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">collapse. Mr Lewis&#8217;s reporting led to the reversing of the original pathologist&#8217;s findings that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Tomlinson died of natural causes, an inquest returning a verdict of unlawful killing, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the prosecution (and subsequent acquittal) of a police officer for manslaughter.</span>

 <p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second Guardian story concerns the tax gap<span style="font-style:italic"> .</span> In a two week series of articles based on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">several months of investigation, a Guardian team in February 2009 revealed how leading</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">companies including Barclays, GlaxoSmithKline and Shell were using a range of highly complex</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offshore devices to avoid paying millions in UK tax. The reports involved the Guardian in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legal battle with Barclays, which sought to prevent publication of documents outlining its tax</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">avoidance schemes, and later led to the Government taking significant steps to crack down</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on tax avoidance.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-16"><a href="#para2-16" name="para2-16">2.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The third story relates to the oil trading firm, Trafigura<span style="font-style:italic"> .</span> In May 2009, The Guardian acquired</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a confidential document which suggested that the waste dumped from a tanker chartered by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Trafigura in the Ivory Coast port of Abidjan was highly toxic. A large number of local residents</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">became sick. Trafigura later attempted to gag the paper by seeking a super-injunction,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">preventing not just publication of the key document but even reporting of an MP&#8217;s question</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about it. After a public campaign the super-injunction was lifted; Trafigura was later convicted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by a Dutch court with regard to the delivery of the toxic waste to, and its export from,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Amsterdam and fined 1 million Euros. The company is appealing the decision.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-17"><a href="#para2-17" name="para2-17">2.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Guardian also refers to its campaign in relation to rendition and torture of detainees<span style="font-style:italic"> .</span> For</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more than five years and in scores of articles, The Guardian&#8217;s Ian Cobain has painstakingly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">uncovered the extent of Britain&#8217;s complicity in the torture and rendition of detainees in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the face of countless official denials. Mr Cobain has linked Britain to the mistreatment of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prisoners in Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Mr Cobain&#8217;s reporting was one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the key factors leading to the Government&#8217;s decision to order an inquiry into allegations of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">British complicity in torture, now delayed until police investigation of two cases is complete.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-18"><a href="#para2-18" name="para2-18">2.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although the underlying disclosures by WikiLeaks remain potentially controversial, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Guardian&#8217;s collaboration with whistleblowers&#8217; website WikiLeaks and four other international</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers in 2010 and 2011 led to the publication of a string of major public interest stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">touching almost every corner of the globe. They included the disclosure that Saudi Arabia</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was secretly putting pressure on the US to attack Iran, that US diplomats believed Russia</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was &#8220;a virtual Mafia state&#8221; and that a British oil company claimed to have &#8220;infiltrated&#8221; all of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nigeria&#8217;s major ministries. The role played by the Guardian, however, is not controversial:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it played a central part in ensuring that hundreds of thousands of documents which might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been dumped &#8220;raw&#8221; on the Internet were carefully analysed first and redacted to avoid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exposure of vulnerable sources. More than 30 Guardian specialist reporters and foreign</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">correspondents were involved in the huge effort to comb and authenticate the documents</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">over several months.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-19"><a href="#para2-19" name="para2-19">2.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Guardian might also have drawn specific attention to the work of Nick Davies in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigating the phone hacking story over a number of years, culminating in the revelations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of July 2011 which led directly to the setting up of this Inquiry. The criticisms made of that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">report are analysed in the case study dealing with the murder of Milly Dowler.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-20"><a href="#para2-20" name="para2-20">2.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In my view, these are all excellent examples of public interest investigative journalism,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">properly so called: in other words, the unearthing of the often unpalatable truth by dogged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hard work and persistence. This is different to the conduct of a campaign for or on behalf</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of causes which meet a newspaper&#8217;s particular agenda. The latter may well discharge an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important public interest function in the drawing of attention to worthwhile causes which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would not otherwise have crossed the public&#8217;s radar and may have no less importance, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the nature and quality of the journalism involved is somewhat different. Nor do I lose sight of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the point that campaigning journalism might be much more controversial on the basis that it</span>
 <span style="font-size: 15px;">is capable of dividing public opinion; here, the newspaper is providing its own megaphone to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">amplify the volume in relation to causes its editors or proprietors happen to favour.</span>
<h4>Northern & Shell</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-21"><a href="#para2-21" name="para2-21">2.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Daily Star, the Daily Star Sunday<span style="font-style:italic"> ,</span> the Daily Express and the Sunday Express have supplied</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry with copies of a considerable number of articles which comprise examples of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">good journalistic practice, whether it be campaigning journalism, investigative journalism, or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a combination of the two. I propose to set out a representative sample below.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-22"><a href="#para2-22" name="para2-22">2.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both the Daily Express and the Sunday Express have mounted a campaign for veterans</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Bomber Command to be accorded greater recognition in view of their and their late</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">colleagues&#8217; service and sacrifice during the Second World War. This campaign has included</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressing for veterans to be issued with the Second World War Campaign Medal, and for a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Bomber Command Memorial to be inaugurated. On 28 June 2012, HM The Queen unveiled</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such a memorial in recognition of the 55,573 aircrew who lost their lives in the Second World</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">War and the Daily Express published a souvenir edition to mark this event.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-23"><a href="#para2-23" name="para2-23">2.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry&#8217;s attention has also been drawn to a number of stories in the Sunday Express</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relating to a scandal uncovered by the newspaper whereby social workers were &#8220;sexing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">up&#8221; documents to give local authorities the power to take thousands of children from their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">families and put them up for adoption, so as to meet flawed Government targets. The paper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is also responsible for an ongoing campaign to achieve a greater understanding and openness</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the discussion and treatment of mental illness.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-24"><a href="#para2-24" name="para2-24">2.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of impressive public interest stories have been run by the Daily Star Sunday, but the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">following examples will suffice for present purposes. First, the newspaper ran several articles</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exposing the activities of the English Defence League (EDL) and contending that they could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legitimately be described as dangerous thugs. When it appeared that the EDL was getting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a groundswell of support among working class people, the newspaper continued running</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strongly worded editorials criticising the group and exposing the criminal records of several</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of their members. More recently, the newspaper&#8217;s investigators spent months working on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scandal of PIP breast implants, speaking to victims and experts to ascertain the dangers the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">implants pose. Key successes include uncovering for the first time a detailed list of ingredients</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contained in the implants.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-25"><a href="#para2-25" name="para2-25">2.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A third public interest inquiry was mounted which, on two occasions, revealed that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">paper had found IT blunders by Government workers who placed restricted information in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public domain by failing adequately to redact them so that the restricted information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not revealed. These stories have led to a change in the way certain departments redact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">documents.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-26"><a href="#para2-26" name="para2-26">2.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Fourth, the newspaper seeks to have an article each week covering the human side of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Following complaints about the quality of equipment the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">servicemen were using, the Daily Star Sunday (along with other newspapers) wrote a series of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">articles calling for improvements to be made. These stories led to a marked improvement in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">equipment, including the decommissioning of so called Snatch Land Rovers. The fifth example</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is that the paper has been investigating unpublicised dangers surrounding Tamiflu for many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">months, after it found it had been linked to the deaths of 13 people. The newspaper exposed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">links between the licensing authority and the drug-maker, and has documented numerous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints from patients affected by the drug.</span>
 <h4>The Sun</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-27"><a href="#para2-27" name="para2-27">2.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Sun&#8217;s written submissions and evidence refer to a number of its campaigns,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> and I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">borne these well in mind, recognising the arguable public interest in bringing these matters</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the attention of their readers at the particular time. But, rather than setting these out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specifically, I believe that it is more valuable at this stage to refer to some of the evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given by its current editor, Dominic Mohan.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-28"><a href="#para2-28" name="para2-28">2.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first example of true public interest journalism concerns neither investigation nor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">campaigning. Rather, it is to explain extremely complex concepts of vital public importance.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By way of example, Mr Mohan referred to an article published on 27 July 2011 in which The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sun gave a succinct description of the state of the Eurozone bailout crisis, saying that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">majority of working people in the UK preferred to read<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> really</span><span style="font-style:italic"> concise</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> well-executed</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">spread ... which gives them very quick, digestible summary of very, very complex issues&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> He</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said that such reporting in The Sun was how &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> millions</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> people</span><span style="font-style:italic"> learn</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> serious</span><span style="font-style:italic"> issues</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">daily basis<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Nobody</span><span style="font-style:normal"> can</span><span style="font-style:normal"> pretend</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> issues</span><span style="font-style:normal"> at</span><span style="font-style:normal"> stake</span><span style="font-style:normal"> are</span><span style="font-style:normal"> straightforward</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> there</span><span style="font-style:normal"> is</span><span style="font-style:normal"> no</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">doubt that journalism of this type is of a very high order.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-29"><a href="#para2-29" name="para2-29">2.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Mohan also referred with pride to The Sun&#8217;s science reporting. He mentioned his</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">engagement of Professor Brian Cox as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> The</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Sun&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Professor</span> &#8221;.

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of this exposure is that there are now three separate and ongoing police investigations by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Metropolitan, Greater Manchester and West Midlands police forces. In addition, the matter is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being pursued in separate professional investigations by the General Medical Council and the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Jersey based tax scheme that shelters &#163;168 million from Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue & Customs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(HMRC). As a result of The Times articles, the Prime Minister condemned Mr Carr&#8217;s conduct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Mr Carr promised to conduct his financial affairs &#8220;much more responsibly&#8221;. HMRC also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">vowed to shut down the &#8220;K2 scheme&#8221; used by Mr Carr and more than 1,000 others.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">which the adoption system had become riddled with delay and inertia, and how that had</span>



 <span style="font-size: 15px;">affected children waiting for permanent new families. As well as stories, interviews, graphics</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and case studies, The Times commissioned Martin Narey, the former director-general of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prison Service, to analyse the system and recommend reforms. The response was swift. First,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in July 2011, the Government appointed Mr Narey as its first ministerial adviser on adoption</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with a remit to drive up the number of adoptions, especially at the worst performing local</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">authorities. Then, in October 2011, the Prime Minister intervened to promise radical reform</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the system. Finally, in December 2011, the Government announced it would scrap the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bureaucratic assessment process for would-be adoptive parents and replace it with a more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">streamlined system.</span>

<h3>MPs&#8217; expenses</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-50"><a href="#para2-50" name="para2-50">2.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Over the years, there have been many examples of journalism at its best, resulting in ground</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breaking stories of national and international importance. The examples provided to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry by press Core Participants are no more than illustrative; and they are intended to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">underline that most journalists go about their work with legal and ethical principles very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">much in mind, and are willing to test the product of their work against what the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest truly demands. It is not the intention of the Inquiry to identify what has been &#8216;the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">best&#8217; or &#8216;the most important&#8217; story but, without putting any one above any other, it is worth</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examining one of the recent ground breaking stories in a little detail, if only to demonstrate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">good practice and the proper exercise of editorial discretion.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-51"><a href="#para2-51" name="para2-51">2.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 8 May 2009, the Daily Telegraph published the first of a number of articles that detailed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the expenses and allowance claims made by MPs over a period of four years from 2004-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2008.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup> These claims contained a significant number of what were said to be fraudulent claims</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that breached both Parliamentary rules on expenses and allowances and, in some cases, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal law. The Telegraph&#8217;s expos&#233; preceded the formal publication of data relating to MPs&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expenses and allowances by Parliament by a number of months. The data that formed the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">basis of the Telegraph&#8217;s stories was contained on one disk, supplied by an undisclosed source</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in exchange for payment of approximately &#163;110,000. Representatives of the Daily Telegraph</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have told the Inquiry that, before deciding to buy the material, they satisfied themselves that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the material was not, in fact, stolen and that its acquisition was not in breach of the criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">law.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-52"><a href="#para2-52" name="para2-52">2.52</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The disclosure by the Telegraph of MPs&#8217; expenses claims was the subject of intense and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extended media coverage and, indeed, public debate. The scale of wrong doing was quickly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognised by the then leaders of the major political parties. Such was the public outrage at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the steady disclosure of expenses claims that MPs appeared to have tried to keep out of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public domain that, almost immediately, senior politicians offered an unreserved apology to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public. On 11 May 2009, the then Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Gordon Brown, apologised</span>



 <span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> behalf</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> all</span><span style="font-style:italic"> politicians</span> &#8221; for the expenses claims that had been made. Later that day, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Leader of the Conservative Party, Rt Hon David Cameron, said that all MPs should apologise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the expenses scandal. He told the BBC that the system of expenses &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> wrong</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> we&#8217;re</span></span>

<p id="para-id-2-53"><a href="#para2-53" name="para2-53">2.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The impact of the revelations was significant. There was an immediate loss of confidence in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the political system generally and in the established mainstream political parties in particular.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This was most clearly manifest in an unprecedented spike in support for minority political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parties. It was also reflected in the observations of leading commentators and thinkers.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The editor of The Times, James Harding, called the unfolding scandal Parliament&#8217;s &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> darkest</span></span>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-54"><a href="#para2-54" name="para2-54">2.54</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The publication of the details of expenses claims was neither the beginning nor the end of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalistic interest in the subject. Journalists had sought to uncover the detail of claims made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by MPs through the use of powers granted under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had come into force in October 2004. The first requests for publication of MPs&#8217; receipts date</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">back to January 2005. Then, journalists Ben Leapman of The Sunday Telegraph, Jon Ungoed-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thomas of The Sunday Times, and the freedom of information campaigner and journalist,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Heather Brooke, submitted Freedom of Information requests relating to the expenses of 14</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MPs, including the then Prime Minister Tony Blair, and the then Conservative front bencher,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">George Osborne.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup> These requests were twice rejected by the House of Commons authorities</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">before they were appealed to the Information Commissioner, by Mr Leapman, Mr Ungoed-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thomas and Ms Brooke, in the spring of 2005.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-55"><a href="#para2-55" name="para2-55">2.55</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The then Information Commissioner, Richard Thomas, considered the three separate requests</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">jointly for two years before, on 13 June 2007, deciding that the requested information should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be disclosed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup> He ruled that the disclosure should be in abridged and aggregated form and</span>









 <span style="font-size: 15px;">without the publication of the relevant receipts underpinning those claims. However, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Information Commissioner&#8217;s decision was appealed by the House of Commons authorities</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">later that month.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup> They argued that the disclosure would be &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> unlawfully</span><span style="font-style:italic"> intrusive</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup> The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case was passed to the Information Tribunal to decide. The journalists who had submitted the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">original requests also appealed the decision.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-56"><a href="#para2-56" name="para2-56">2.56</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Two months previously, in May 2007, a majority of MPs had voted for the Freedom of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Information (Amendment) Bill introduced by the Conservative MP, David MacClean, which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposed to exempt MPs from the terms of the 2000 Act. The Bill was withdrawn shortly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">before its second reading in the House of Lord&#8217;s as peers were not willing to sponsor the bill.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although unsuccessful, this was the first of three attempts by Parliamentarians to restrict the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">application of the Freedom of Information Act to Parliament ahead of the formal publication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of MPs&#8217; expenses claims. In July 2008, amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 2004</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were passed by Parliament. These exempted the addresses of Members of Parliament from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the terms of the Act. Lastly, in January 2009, Harriet Harman QC MP, then the Leader of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">House of Commons, tabled a motion intended to exempt expenses claims from disclosure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under the Freedom of Information Act. Although Government MPs were placed under a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">three line whip, opposition Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs opposed the motion. On</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">21 January 2009, the proposals were formally dropped by the Government.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-57"><a href="#para2-57" name="para2-57">2.57</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In February 2008, the Information Tribunal published its decision on MPs&#8217; expenses, rejecting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the defence put forward by the House of Commons authorities.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup> Further, it ordered the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">release of information on 14 MPs.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup> The hearings that led to the decision were not without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further controversy: in particular, there were revelations around the content of the so called</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">John Lewis list which set out the amounts that could be claimed for particular items without</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">question or justification. The items on the list were benchmarked against the purchase price</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for such items at the John Lewis department store chain.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-58"><a href="#para2-58" name="para2-58">2.58</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The decision of the Information Tribunal to order the publication of expenses was the subject</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of an immediate appeal to the High Court by a small number of senior MPs representing each</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the main political parties. On 16 May 2008, the court ruled that the requested details of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MPs expenses should be released.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref38" href="#footnote38">38</a></sup> Moreover, the High Court also ruled that further details</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not included in the original order made by the Information Commissioner should be disclosed,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including addresses. Following the High Court ruling, no further appeal was lodged and, on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">23 May 2008, the expense claims of 14 MPs, including the former Prime Minister Tony Blair</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the Foreign Secretary, Margaret Beckett, were made public.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-59"><a href="#para2-59" name="para2-59">2.59</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The ruling of the High Court and the subsequent disclosure of the expenses of the 14 MPs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">named in the test case, did not lead directly to or necessarily expedite the publication of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expenses claims of all MPs scheduled by the House of Commons authorities. It had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intended that publication would take place in November 2008 but the date of the release</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the information was pushed back until the summer of 2009, ostensibly to allow for the</span>






 <span style="font-size: 15px;">proper collation of the data.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref39" href="#footnote39">39</a></sup> In April 2009, the House of Commons authorities announced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that publication of expenses, with certain information deemed &#8220;sensitive&#8221; removed, would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">take place in July 2009.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-60"><a href="#para2-60" name="para2-60">2.60</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 18 June 2009, more than one month after the first disclosures in the Daily Telegraph,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the details of all MPs&#8217; expenses and allowance claims approved by the House of Commons</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">authorities during the period from 2004 to 2008 were published on the official Parliament</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">website. However, a number of details, including personal data such as addresses, were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">redacted. The published data also excluded claims made by Parliamentarians that had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not been approved for payment by the House of Commons authorities, as well as related</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">correspondence between MPs and the Parliamentary fees office. These omissions resulted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in further allegations in the press of unnecessary secrecy, and also served to confirm an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">increasingly widespread suspicion that the most serious abuses of the expenses system</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would not have come to light had the redacted documentation been the only information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">available. Details of voluntary repayments by MPs amounting to almost &#163;500,000 were also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">published by the House of Commons authorities.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-61"><a href="#para2-61" name="para2-61">2.61</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is noteworthy that shortly after the publication of the first of the disclosures in the Daily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Telegraph, the House of Commons authorities asked the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS),</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to investigate the journalistic activities of the paper. This request was declined by the MPS on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the grounds that a prosecution would not, in any event, be in the public interest (although,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as identified above, the then editor of the Daily Telegraph made clear in his evidence that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advice that he received was that no criminal act had taken place).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup></span>

<h4>Disclosure by the Daily Telegraph: the story</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-62"><a href="#para2-62" name="para2-62">2.62</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 30 April 2009, the Daily Telegraph obtained access to a full copy of all expenses claims</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made by MPs between 2004 and 2008. This data had been purchased from a middleman,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Major John Wick, for the sum of approximately &#163;110,000. The material had also been offered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to other newspapers including The Times and The Sun. Mr Harding confirmed in evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that his newspaper decided against purchasing the information because of concerns that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it may have been stolen.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup> The Daily Telegraph began publishing in instalments, from 8 May</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Lewis has given evidence at length to the Inquiry about the process which led to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">purchase of the material by the Daily Telegraph. He said that the decision to purchase and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publish the material was iterative: senior management at the newspaper were consulted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">throughout and fully aware of the need to establish the provenance and legality of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material, as well as the need to make most effective use of the limited ten day&#8217;s worth of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">access to the data that the Daily Telegraph had purchased in the first instance.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup> Mr Lewis also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made clear that conditions based on fairness and impartiality were attached to the sale of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material by the seller.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup> Mr Lewis has said that he was mindful that the need to meet those</span>







 <span style="font-size: 15px;">conditions determined the scope and sequencing of the eventual publication of the material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from 8 May.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-64"><a href="#para2-64" name="para2-64">2.64</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Lewis told the Inquiry that the purchase and publication of data was a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> story</span><span style="font-style:italic"> laced</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Daily Telegraph were worried that the material may have been fabricated as part of an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">elaborate hoax. He suggested that the memory of The Sunday Times&#8217; publication of &#8216;the Hitler</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">diaries&#8217; in the early 1980s<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup> had cast a long shadow over many of those who were in some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way involved with that story.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref49" href="#footnote49">49</a></sup> Mr Lewis said that the legality of the data was also a serious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consideration. However, Mr Lewis&#8217; position was that there was an overriding public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in ensuring that the data entered the public domain, and in exposing what he described</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> profound</span><span style="font-style:italic"> wrong-doing</span><span style="font-style:italic"> at</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> heart</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> House</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Commons</span> &#8221;,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup> as well as to ensure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that readers were informed about how the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> MPs</span><span style="font-style:italic"> were</span><span style="font-style:italic"> fleecing</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> taxpayer</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">51</a></sup> Further, Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lewis told the Inquiry that the decision to publish was justified because the official disclosure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of these expenses claims by the House of Commons authorities would have omitted key</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information, particularly around the re-designation of second-home nominations. Mr Lewis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">confirmed that the public interest in publishing data, rather than any commercial value or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advantage to the newspaper, was the determining factor in the decision to purchase and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publish the data.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref52" href="#footnote52">52</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-65"><a href="#para2-65" name="para2-65">2.65</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Aside from the advice on the criminal law which the Daily Telegraph received, Mr Lewis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained that there were further legal considerations that the newspaper had to overcome</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ahead of publication of the material. Specifically, these were around the conditions set down</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the source of the data, and focused on payment for the data, the legal protection of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">source and the fair and balanced treatment of the material.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-66"><a href="#para2-66" name="para2-66">2.66</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For Mr Lewis, the greatest challenge faced by the newspaper was in the analysis of the data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">itself within the initial ten day time-frame permitted under the terms of the sale.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref54" href="#footnote54">54</a></sup> This, Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lewis said, was undertaken by a dedicated MPs&#8217; expenses team working solely and secretly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the data.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref55" href="#footnote55">55</a></sup> The team examined more than 1 million documents on the disk, representing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about half of the total data set.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref56" href="#footnote56">56</a></sup> There followed serious consideration with colleagues at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the paper as to how best to ensure that the revelation of the data was fair and balanced.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition, the newspaper wrote to the MPs concerned in order to seek confirmation from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them of the veracity of the claims. It was only when the then Justice Secretary, the Rt Hon</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Jack Straw MP, responded to the paper confirming the detail of his claims and providing an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explanation for them that Mr Lewis felt sufficiently confident to proceed with publication of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the story.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref57" href="#footnote57">57</a></sup></span>












 <p id="para-id-2-67"><a href="#para2-67" name="para2-67">2.67</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Daily Telegraph revealed details of these expenses sequentially.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref58" href="#footnote58">58</a></sup> The first revelations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerned the expenses of the then governing Labour Party,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup> beginning with the claims</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made by members of the Cabinet.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup> Details of claims made by junior ministers and Labour</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">backbenchers followed. A further tranche of expenses claims made by Labour MPs was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">published on 14 May.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref61" href="#footnote61">61</a></sup> In order to provide the fairness and balance imposed as a condition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of purchase, the coverage did not focus exclusively on claims which had been made by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then Government. On 11 and 12 May, the Daily Telegraph revealed details of the expenses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">claimed by members of the Front Bench of the Conservative Party,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref62" href="#footnote62">62</a></sup> followed by the claims</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of backbench Conservative MPs. The expenses claims made by Liberal Democrat MPs were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">revealed last of the three main parties.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref63" href="#footnote63">63</a></sup></span>
<h4>Areas of abuse</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-68"><a href="#para2-68" name="para2-68">2.68</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inadditiontotheexposition andpublicationofspecific allegationsofincorrectclaims,including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">claims for the cost of mortgages already repaid in full, the Daily Telegraph also set out alleged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">abuses of the Parliamentary &#8220;Green Book&#8221; rules on expenses and allowances. These, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper rightly contended, provided considerable scope for a number of different abuses.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In particular, the abuses set out by the Daily Telegraph related to costs of maintaining two</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">residences, one in the constituency and one in London. Other alleged abuses brought to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public attention by the Daily Telegraph included (but were not limited to):</span>

<li><span style="font-size: 15px;"> nominating</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> second</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> homes:</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> the</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> Green</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> Book</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> states</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> that</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;"> location</span><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;"> your</span><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;"> main</span><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;"> home</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">home, enabling them to claim for purchasing, renovating and furnishing more than one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">property. This practice has become known as &#8220;flipping&#8221;;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">were able to add significantly to the value of a property. By implication some &#8220;second</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">homes&#8221; were effectively businesses not homes since they were renovated on expenses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and then rapidly sold;</span>

<li><span style="font-size: 15px;"> claiming</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> expenses</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> while</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> living</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> in</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> &#8220;grace</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> and</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> favour&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> homes:</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> Ministers</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> with</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> &#8220;grace</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">favour&#8221; homes in Westminster were also able to claim for a &#8220;second home&#8221; as well as</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">as to their legitimacy.</span>






 <h4>Parliamentary reaction</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-69"><a href="#para2-69" name="para2-69">2.69</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The expenses claims disclosed by the Daily Telegraph and subsequent public anger at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behaviour of MPs led to substantial changes to the manner in which Parliamentary expenses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and allowances were administered. On 20 May 2009, Ms Harman, announced the creation of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority to manage Parliamentarians&#8217; expenses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independently of any interference from Parliament.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref64" href="#footnote64">64</a></sup> Further, an independent Panel chaired</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by Sir Thomas Legg was established to examine all claims relating to the second home</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allowance between 2004 and 2008. The panel published its findings on 12 October 2009 as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MPs returned to Parliament following the summer recess.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref65" href="#footnote65">65</a></sup> Many claims that had previously</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been regarded as legitimate were now considered to have breached the rules.</span>
<h4>Consequences</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-70"><a href="#para2-70" name="para2-70">2.70</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As a direct result of the Daily Telegraph&#8217;s expos&#233;:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) four MPs and two peers have been imprisoned; some peers have been excluded from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Lords&#8217; Chamber until repayment of their claims; and one former MP has been found</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unfit to stand trial, although in a trial of issue the jury found that she had committed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">false accounting and used false instruments;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) several other MPs remain subject to police investigation;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) there was the biggest shift in the composition of Parliament for a generation, with more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than 100 MPs announcing their intention to retire or leave the House of Commons;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) six ministers resigned or were reshuffled amid controversy over their expense claims;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) the first resignation of the Speaker of the House of Commons in generations occurred;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(f) morethan&#163;1million intaxpayers&#8217;moneyhasbeenreturnedtoParliamentaryauthorities</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">by MPs;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(g) a new transparent system with an independent regulator was established. In its first</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">year, the new system led to a reduction in the cost of the MPs&#8217; expenses scheme of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#163;15 million; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(h) in addition, the investigation led to wide areas of Government expenditure being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opened up to public scrutiny and the acceptance that, as the Prime Minister put it:</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">&#8216;<span style="font-style:italic"> sunlight</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> best</span><span style="font-style:italic"> disinfectant&#8217;</span> .</span>

<p id="para-id-2-71"><a href="#para2-71" name="para2-71">2.71</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Daily Telegraph&#8217;s detractors might say that the story brought the paper a huge publicity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">coup and the inevitable increases in circulation and sales: all the ingredients of a modern</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">succ&#232;s du scandale.<span style="font-style:normal"> Rupert</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Murdoch</span><span style="font-style:normal"> expressed</span><span style="font-style:normal"> his</span><span style="font-style:normal"> &#8216;disappointment&#8217;</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> The</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Times</span><span style="font-style:normal"> had</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not felt able to buy up the story from the middleman when he was touting it around the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">market place. Overall, however, the Daily Telegraph earned whatever commercial advantages</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it secured from its substantial financial investment. Although it might be stretching language</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">somewhat to call this a case of investigative journalism in the exact sense of the term (the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material was effectively handed to the Daily Telegraph on a metaphorical plate and did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">needtoberootedoutinthemannerofaThalidomideinvestigation)theobviouspublicinterest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the story and the fact that it was undeniably &#8216;laced with risk&#8217; deserve full recognition. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">data might have been bogus; there was certainly an issue as to whether some breach of the</span>


 <span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal law had occurred (or, at the very least, ethical concerns surrounding the manner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in which the data had been extracted and supplied); and a vast amount of work had to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undertaken to analyse and review the raw material not least to ensure accuracy. The legal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and ethical issues were properly and responsibly addressed, and the Inquiry is fully satisfied</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that no corners were cut. This, as I am pleased to repeat, is an example of journalism at its</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">best.</span>
