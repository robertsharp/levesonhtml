<h1>CHAPTER 9<br/>PLURALITY AND MEDIA OWNERSHIP: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Terms of Reference require me to make recommendations:</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">(a)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for a new more effective policy and regulatory regime which supports the integrity and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">freedom of the press, the plurality of the media, and its independence, including from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government, while encouraging the highest ethical and professional standards; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">(b)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for how future concerns about press behaviour, media policy, regulation and cross-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media ownership should be dealt with by all the relevant authorities, including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Parliament, Government, the prosecuting authorities and the police.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Specifically, in the context of plurality, I must therefore ensure that my recommendations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would support media plurality and that I identify how concerns about cross media ownership</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be dealt with, including by Parliament and Government. This does not amount to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a requirement for a detailed prescription on what constitutes sufficient plurality or the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">technical means of achieving it. It is important to note that, within the broad constraints of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the work that the Inquiry has had to undertake, there has been insufficient time to devote</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to a full scale review or to look in detail at these issues. My analysis and recommendations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are therefore at the level of desirable outcomes and broad policy framework, rather than the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">technical means of achieving those outcomes.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Part C Chapter 4 sets out the importance of plurality, what it means and the legislative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">framework in place currently to ensure sufficient plurality in the media. In this Chapter I look</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the extent to which any change is required and if so, what that change should be.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although set out in Part C, Chapter 4, it is worth repeating the goal by reference to the Ofcom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">definition of the desired outcome of a plural market:</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">(a)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;ensuring there is a diversity of viewpoints available and consumed across and within</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media enterprises;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) preventing any one media owner or voice having too much influence over public opinion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the political agenda.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This approach to both the diversity of views available and the influence wielded seems to be</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">generally accepted.</span>

<h3>What are the questions that need to be answered?</h3>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That is more or less where the consensus ends. The Inquiry is required to recommend a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory and policy framework that supports plurality and to make recommendations for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">how future concerns in relation to cross-media ownership should be handled. These are</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref1" name="footnote1" title="Go back to footnote reference 1 in the text">1</a>.  p8 ,para 3.8, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Submission-by-Ofcom-Measuring-Media-Plurality1.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1461"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">rather partial questions in respect of plurality and do not invite or require the Inquiry to come</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">up with a comprehensive or detailed plurality or media ownership framework.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The questions that have emerged from the evidence are:</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">(a)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">What should be considered to be the scope of any plurality policy? Does this apply just</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to news and current affairs or should it go wider?</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">(b)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">How should plurality be measured?</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">(c)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">What form should any requirements to support plurality take, and what sort of remedies</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be available to deliver them?</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">(d)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Should such controls be triggered only by mergers and acquisitions or is there an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argument for looking to closures and organic growth in the market?</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">(e)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Who should be responsible for measurement of plurality, decisions on whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remedies are required and decisions on what remedies to apply?</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The rest of this chapter seeks to answer each of these questions in turn.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. Scope</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By &#8216;scope&#8217;, essentially, I mean the nature of the published content to which any plurality rules</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should relate. The media ownership rules apply at the moment to newspapers, analogue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">television and analogue radio. The governments of the day made it clear, in bringing forward</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Broadcasting Act 1990 and the Communications Act 2003, that this was because of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scarcity of analogue spectrum and the limits that that placed on the number of channels that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could be licensed. By contrast, they were clear that the same concerns would not apply in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">multi-channel environment provided by digital broadcasting. In the analogue world, where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there were only the Channel 3 commercial channels and Channel 5, it was obvious that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">holder of any one licence would have a significant proportion of the broadcast voice. We are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">now in a wholly multi-channel world. Anyone with access to television in the UK now has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">access to over 40 channels providing a varied diet of news, entertainment, cultural output,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">drama and sport. Anyone with access to the internet in the UK has access to many providers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of news and information, all the genres available on television and a whole host of other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">forms of digital content.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom notes that both it, and other regulatory authorities, have concentrated to date on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">news and current affairs, but that this is not required by the legislative framework.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> There are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arguments for broadening the scope. Stephen Barnett, Professor of Communications at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">University of Westminster, stressed that, in his opinion, plurality as a concept extends beyond</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the narrowly political to the wider cultural environment.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> He eloquently explained why:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> corporate</span><span style="font-style:italic"> cultures</span><span style="font-style:italic"> will</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> direct</span><span style="font-style:italic"> bearing</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> decisions</span><span style="font-style:italic"> such</span><span style="font-style:italic"> as</span><span style="font-style:italic"> whether</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> prioritise</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">celebrity stories, or invest in foreign news bureaux, or hire polemical columnists, or run</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a specific campaign (e.g. on Europe, sentencing policy in the criminal courts, or benefit</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">levels) and [that] these in turn will impact on the national conversation. The greater</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">number of such powerful organisations, the greater the opportunities for diversity of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">all forms of expression.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Similarly,ClaireEnders,founderofEndersAnalysis, pointedoutthatbecausemediaenterprises</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">tend to produce a mix of news and entertainment, not only is it difficult to separate them</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">economically, but that in practice a media organisation that achieves a very large share of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the entertainment market will have similarly high levels of economic power both inside and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">outside of that market.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> Thus large media organisations have the power to shape the wider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cultural agenda of the nation, as well as wielding significant economic power.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is worth looking at the issue of economic power in more detail. Many of the national</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper groups are owned by companies or individuals with significant economic interests</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">outsideofthenewspapermarket.ThebusinessempiresoftheBarclayfamily,LordRothermere</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or the Lebedev family would never be capable of inclusion in any form of plurality measure.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The position of NewsCorp is different because the vast majority of NewsCorp&#8217;s interests are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the media market. However, it is not obvious that all aspects of the media market will have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an impact on plurality. BSkyB achieved its high proportion of television subscribers through</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its ability to offer exclusive access to premium sport and film content. It is difficult to see how</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sport coverage can have an impact on plurality of news provision, and the fact that a person</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can access television through a Sky box may have no impact whatsoever on what news or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cultural channels they watch. Similarly, Richard Desmond owns some adult TV channels,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which might be loosely considered to be in the media market but are unlikely to have any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impact on plurality in the way we understand it. In order to be consistent, therefore, it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important, to consider economic power in relation only to the content that is considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant to plurality, not economic power more generally.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A further point about economic power is the potential ability of a large media organisation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to leverage its different distribution channels to cross promote products, or even to engage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in predatory pricing in one part of the market to the disadvantage of a competitor in order to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">secure an advantage in another part of the market. These are real issues, though not ones for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry. I would urge both Ofcom and the Competition authorities to ensure that, when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considering both plurality and competition issues in the media sector, the ways in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">power is used across a media organisation&#8217;s interests is taken into account.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The question to be addressed, then, is what content should be considered relevant to plurality.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The media consultant Robin Foster agreed that there was a case for starting with a wide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perspective and looking at wider cultural activity and output in the UK, as different aspects</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of culture and content can have an impact on the way in which we think about our society</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and our understanding of social and political issues. However, he concludes that in practical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terms the most important focus is on news media and related current affairs, opinion and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">debate.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> Similarly, Ofcom conclude that news and current affairs are the most relevant form</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of content for the delivery of public policy goals and they recommend that the scope of any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">plurality review should be limited to these.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his capacity as Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Jeremy Hunt adopted a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">similar approach, saying that he shared the view implicit in the guidance issued by the then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government in relation to the operation of the plurality provision in the 2003 Act, namely,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that &#8220;plurality&#8221; should principally be concerned with the provision of news and current affairs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as those are the main areas where owners could seek to influence opinions and control the</span>

<a name="page1463"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">political agenda.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> As Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, Dr Vince Cable also</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">agreed:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I apply the concept to news and current affairs primarily. There is an argument for a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">diversity of provision of sport, comedy, drama, religious affairs and other items and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">these issues are covered in significant measure by the public service obligation of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">terrestrial channels. But news and current affairs are different since they are of direct</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">concern not just to the consuming public but to the functioning of democracy and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">choice of governments.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whilst the complexity of the media market and public habits of consumption of news and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">entertainment make this a complex issue,</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I  recommend  that  the  particular  public  policy  goals  of  ensuring  that  citizens  are </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">informed  and  preventing  too  much  influence  in  any  one  pair  of  hands  over  the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">political process, are most directly served by concentrating on plurality in news and </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">current affairs. However, this focus should be kept under review.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The next question in relation to scope is what types of news and current affairs media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are included in the measure. It is obvious that television, radio and newsprint should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">included, as they are today. However, online consumption of news is already significant and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is increasing, with 41% of adults in the UK regularly using the internet for news.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> All the main</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">UK broadcast and print news providers have an online presence, making the internet a very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significant delivery channel and route to influence for them. In addition, there are new big</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">players online, with Ofcom research showing that 19% of people who use the internet for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">news use Facebook and Google News.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> In addition, of course, the internet provides access to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a profusion of new, individual, smaller voices through, for example, blogs.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Robin Foster points to the growth of news provision online, including through content</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aggregators, search engines, social networking sites and digital app stores, as a key</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">development. The nature of these delivery mechanisms is such that they could, if they wished</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to do so, act as gatekeepers to the news that their users receive. Thus, the internet has an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important role to play in distributing news to consumers but there are potential plurality risks</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as those models develop. Mr Foster is clear that online provision should not be ignored when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considering plurality.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">Ofcom conclude that online should be included in any market assessment. I entirely </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">agree with this view and recommend that online publication should be included in </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">any market assessment for consideration of plurality.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-12"><a href="#para2-12" name="para2-12">2.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom was also asked to consider whether the BBC should be included in any measure of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">plurality. They concluded that, as by some way the biggest provider of news, it must be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">included in any measure of plurality in the market, but that the governance controls in place</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to ensure internal plurality within the BBC, and the effect of the impartiality requirements,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meant that its size gave rise to no plurality concerns. This is an interesting point. The</span>

<a name="page1464"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">Governance provisions of the BBC require a high degree of editorial independence within the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Corporation, which, when working effectively, ensure that a diversity of voices and viewpoints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the different channels and programmes. This, perhaps, provides a model that would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">help to ensure plurality in relation to other large players in the media market.</span>

<a name="section3"></a>
<h2>3. Measuring plurality</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Measuring plurality is far from straightforward. There are two outcomes sought: diversity of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">views, and the prevention of excessive influence, and neither is simple to measure. In relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to diversity of views, it is necessary not just to look for a proliferation of different voices but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also for consumption of different voices. The measure must therefore include both a simple</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">count of the number of voices available and some measure of the extent to which these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voices are heard or consumed. In relation to excessive influence, the search must be some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">measure not just of how many people are exposed to the voice but also the extent of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">influence that it has; this may depend on the audience reached, the trust they repose in it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the number of other sources that they consult.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom was asked by the Secretary of State to set out options for measuring media plurality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">across platforms and to recommend the best approach.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup> They considered three different</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">types of metrics: availability, consumption and impact. The first conclusion is that availability</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">metrics &#8211; the number and range of titles and providers &#8211; have a role to play in measuring</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">plurality but offer limited insight and on their own are not sufficient.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom considered five different types of consumption metrics: the volume of consumption</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(how much time a consumer spends consuming the relevant content); cross-media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consumption (the extent to which a single provider&#8217;s sources are consumed across the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different media); revenue (a basic market share measure); reach (a measure of those who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are exposed to the content) and multi-sourcing (a measure of how many sources a consumer</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">uses).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of these Ofcom concludes that revenue is not particularly helpful, as most measures of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">revenue do not distinguish news and current affairs from other programming, and there is,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in any case, a less direct relationship between revenue and influence than between revenue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and economic power.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the event, Ofcom propose a complex set of measures based around share of consumption,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which they believe provides a good proxy for measuring influence in the news media market,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and reach and multi-sourcing, which provide a good proxy for measuring the diversity of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">viewpointsconsumed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup> ClaireEndersprefersameasureofshareofconsumption,arguingthat</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">but suggests, in addition, that more work be done on how to compare consumption across</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">different media on a more consistent basis. Mr Foster also urges that a better understanding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be developed of how audiences use their different sources of news and how they use news</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom&#8217;s consumption measure would be supplemented by a measure of impact. There</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is no single proxy for impact and Ofcom suggest that the importance that users attach to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">news sources, and their perceptions of the impartiality, reliability and quality of the news</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provided should be taken into account.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup> Ofcom also argue that contextual factors should also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be taken into account. These include regulation and oversight; governance models; internal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">plurality; and the potential power or editorial control exerted by owners within commercial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisations.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In relation to online news providers, Ofcom suggest that the share, and possibly reach, of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">top news websites would be the best measure to use currently, and that, in any review of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">measurement framework, the suitability of online measures should be looked at.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is clear that there is no single measure that will provide an adequate picture of plurality.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Ofcom model is complex and includes all the measures that have been put forward.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition, Ofcom suggests that the measurement framework itself should be assessed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regularly to ensure that it continues to capture the key elements of plurality.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom have set out a comprehensive approach that is likely to provide as good a picture</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the plurality in the media market as can be derived. However, its complexity is also a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disadvantage, in that it will be difficult for most people to understand and could come under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sustained attack from those media providers who feel that they may be the subject of plurality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns. In that context it is significant that BSkyB objected to that methodology, used by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom, in the public interest test on the NewsCorp/BSkyB bid.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that Ofcom and the Government should work, with the industry, on </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">the measurement framework, in order to achieve as great a measure of consensus </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">as  is  possible  on  the  theory  of  how  media  plurality  should  be  measured  before </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">the measuring system is deployed, with all the likely commercial tensions that will </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 16px;">emerge. </span>

<h2>4. Limits and remedies</h2>

<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If agreement can be reached on what is meant by plurality, plurality of what and how to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">measure that plurality, the next question is what constitutes sufficient or adequate plurality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and what can or should be done to ensure maintenance of sufficient or adequate plurality.</span>

<h3>Caps on market share</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The starting point for some of the witnesses to the Inquiry has been that there should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a fixed limit on the percentage of revenue of the total cross-media market. Specifically,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Enders suggests that no single company should be able to acquire more than 15% of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the media market by revenue.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup> In this context she defines the media market as including:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">national and regional newspapers; consumer magazines; video games; television advertising;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">television subscription fees; books (both physical and digital); cinema; video/DVD rental</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence Ms Enders explained that neither the 15% limit nor the market definition were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specific proposals, but were rather designed as a starting point for discussion.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Enders said that the market definition was:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;trying to draw a media market, not actually a market for plurality purposes.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is interesting that, having said that a consumption measure was the best measure of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">plurality, her proposed solution depends entirely on a measure of revenue. She explained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that her proposition was really about getting a debate started on how many big media players</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be the right number for the UK. A limit of 15% would require at least 7 major players (or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a very large number of small players). A limit of, 25% would allow consolidation to only 4 big</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media actors.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup> Ms Enders clarified that, to the extent that the idea of the cap was a proposal,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the intention would be that it should operate in relation to mergers and acquisitions, not to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organic growth.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt MP told the Inquiry that it was important that the approach to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">plurality should not stifle innovation or growth in the sector. One option would be to prescribe</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specific limits for media and cross-media ownership, but the regulator would need flexibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in operating them, whilst still providing sufficient certainty to business in order to encourage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investment.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Rt Hon Harriet Harman MP suggested that there could be a cap on the percentage of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">revenue of the UK&#8217;s total cross media market that any one company or individual would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allowed to own, and that there should be a restriction, for example 30%, on the proportion of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper circulation that could be in the hands of one organisation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup> In addition to the idea</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a fixed upper cap Ms Harman suggested that transactions leading to a holding of between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">20% and 30% of newspaper circulation should be subject to Ofcom approval and possible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conditions.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Rt Hon Nick Clegg MP said that he was open to a percentage cap, or a figure at which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an investigation might be triggered, but that he imagined that such a measure would prove</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">difficult to define.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup> Similarly, the Rt Hon Dr Vince Cable MP felt that the current plurality test</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was too imprecise. He suggested that it might be possible to specify a limit, such as 25% of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">combined media markets, beyond which a plurality test should be applied.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, Ofcom take the view that absolute limits or prohibitions on market share, that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would require automatic divestment if breached, leave no room for flexibility and give rise to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the risk that it is not possible to address issues of commercial sustainability and innovation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in an appropriate manner. They argue that such an interventionist approach should only be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">applied in a targeted manner to those issues of greatest concern.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-8"><a href="#para4-8" name="para4-8">4.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As well as a media-wide limit as suggested by Ms Enders, Ofcom consider the case for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">platform specific limits in relation to newspapers and television. In relation to newspapers,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Ofcom report notes that limitations on a declining market run counter to the need for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper groups to build market share in order to survive. In relation to television, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">report suggests that the existing impartiality rules, and the existence of the BBC under public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ownership, deliver sufficient regulation for impartiality and that a platform specific cap would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have limited impact.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup></span>
<h3>Sufficiency</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-9"><a href="#para4-9" name="para4-9">4.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom propose that, instead of fixed caps, there should be a concept of sufficiency of plurality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">against which to conduct a market review. Unlike a cap, a concept of sufficiency would not be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">precise. Ofcom suggest that a first step could be to set it out in qualitative terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">(a)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There is a diverse range of independent news media voices<span style="font-style:normal"> across</span><span style="font-style:normal"> all</span><span style="font-style:normal"> platforms.</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">(b)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Overall reach and consumption is relatively high among all consumer demographics</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and across all of the UK&#8217;s nations and English regions.</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">(c)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Consumers actively multisource &#8211; such that the large majority of individuals consume a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">range of different news sources.</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">(d)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Sufficiently low barriers to entry and competition between providers spurs quality and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">innovation in the gathering and dissemination of news.</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">(e)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Overall investment and commercial returns are sufficiently high to ensure sustainability,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and guarantee high quality coverage, extensive newsgathering and investigative</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalism.</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">(f)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">No organisation or news source has a share of consumption that is so high as to create</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a risk that consumers are exposed to a narrow set of viewpoints.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-10"><a href="#para4-10" name="para4-10">4.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The report goes on to suggest that it may be possible to develop a set of the levels of each of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the metrics to be used in measuring plurality that would provide an indication of a plurality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern. These would not be limits, but they would provide a degree of clarity to the market</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as to what levels of concentration would be likely to give rise to such concerns.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-11"><a href="#para4-11" name="para4-11">4.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Enders also looks at what might be sufficient plurality. She quotes Professor Charlotte</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whether the approach involves a fixed limit or an indicative level, there needs to be some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way of identifying the point at which concerns arise. Other than the 15% figure offered, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not defended, by Ms Enders, there have been no suggestions as to what level of plurality is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficient. It will certainly be different in different markets: for example, in the many regions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that have only one local newspaper, it is generally accepted that one is better than none</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and no remedies are applied to what is, by default, a monopoly position. The Inquiry has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no basis on which to reach a conclusion on what constitutes sufficient plurality, though it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seems reasonable to conclude that concerns about plurality would arise at lower levels of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concentration than concerns about competition.</span>

<h3>Structural remedies</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-13"><a href="#para4-13" name="para4-13">4.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom note that structural remedies offer clarity and certainty, can deliver long term benefits</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and do not require ongoing monitoring. They also note that such remedies may be ineffective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if the divested interests are commercially unsustainable. Structural remedies can act as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disincentive to investment and innovation and represent a significant regulatory intervention</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and impose potentially significant transition and transaction costs on the parties concerned.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup></span>

<h3>Behavioural remedies</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-14"><a href="#para4-14" name="para4-14">4.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Foster suggests that it would be better to move away from structural remedies, such as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">caps on market share, and towards behavioural remedies. These could include requirements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to invest in content; requirements to make space available for the inclusion of alternative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">viewpoints; effective right of reply procedures; and independent editorial boards.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-15"><a href="#para4-15" name="para4-15">4.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom identify three different forms of behavioural remedies that could be used. First, there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are behavioural rules that may help to increase levels of internal plurality, for example by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ensuring editorial independence for specific titles, channels or programmes. This approach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may be less intrusive and more proportionate than structural remedies but would require</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complex ongoing monitoring and it does not have a particularly good reputation for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effectiveness.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-16"><a href="#para4-16" name="para4-16">4.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, Ofcom point to behavioural remedies that improve standards. This might include</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requirements on fairness, or accuracy and completeness in what is reported. This approach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be objective and well understood, but would also require ongoing monitoring and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there is a risk that such remedies, if applied too widely, would reduce diversity in content.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-17"><a href="#para4-17" name="para4-17">4.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, Ofcom consider behavioural remedies to improve access. Must-carry obligations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could require a distribution platform to distribute the content of news providers meeting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specific criteria, while must-offer obligations could be used to ensure that news providers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">distribute their content via any platform meeting specified criteria. This is a good remedy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to address specific concerns about discrimination by gatekeepers. It is unlikely to require</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">active monitoring as those entitled to access will complain if it is not complied with. However,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this approach can be susceptible to gaming and can become outdated in the light of market</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">developments.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup> Robin Foster also considered access remedies, though specifically in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context of digital intermediaries. He suggested that a mixture of a guarantee that content</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would not be blocked, must-carry provisions, and an audit mechanism of some sort, might be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered should any relevant plurality concerns be identified.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup></span>

<a name="page1469"></a><!--new page--><h3>Positive interventions to encourage more news provision</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-18"><a href="#para4-18" name="para4-18">4.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition to remedies designed to control excessive influence, Ofcom note that there is an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">option of taking action to encourage more news provision. This could take the form of public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">funding of news provision or placing obligations in relation to news and current affairs on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">existing providers in return for some benefit. The most obvious examples of this approach are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the BBC and the public service broadcasting content obligations on Channel 3 and 5 licence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">holders. Remedies of this sort are particularly appropriate where commercial provision of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">content required is not sustainable. Ofcom note that this approach does not penalise success</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as any of the structural or behavioural remedies might and, furthermore, could be a good way</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of promoting plurality. However, it would require both public funding and very careful design</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to minimise the effect of subsidies on market-based provision.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup> Professor Curran also sets</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out proposals for a system of funding for areas of the media underserved by the market.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-19"><a href="#para4-19" name="para4-19">4.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The argument for mechanically applied fixed caps or limits does not seem to me to be made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out. Given the importance of having both public consensus on what constitutes sufficient</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">plurality and sufficient clarity in the market to encourage investment, it would be sensible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for Ofcom to carry out a consultative process designed to identify indicative levels of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">various metrics that they are proposing to use that would give rise to plurality concerns. I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">am neither qualified, nor required, to give my own view on what such levels should be, and I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have no intention of doing so. I do, however, accept that the importance of plurality of news</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and current affairs provision is a qualitatively different issue to those arising from general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">competition concerns.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I therefore recommend that the levels of influence that would give rise to concerns in </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">relation to plurality must be lower, and probably considerably lower, than the levels </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">of concentration that would give rise to competition concerns.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-20"><a href="#para4-20" name="para4-20">4.20</a></p>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">Ofcom has presented the Inquiry and the Government with a full menu of potential </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">remedies,  and  I  have  not  seen  any  arguments  to  suggest  that  any  of  them  are </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">inappropriate  in  principle.  Each  of  them  might  be  appropriate  in  a  given  set  of </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">circumstances and I recommend that the relevant regulatory authority should have </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">all of them in its armoury.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Icanseethatthismightbedifficult,becauseofthefundingimplications,inrelationtomeasures</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">actively to promote plurality. I am particularly drawn to behavioural remedies that would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforce standards, not least because it could add force to other aspects of standards covered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in this Report. There are strong arguments for requiring a news provider with a substantial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">market share to ensure editorial independence both from the proprietor or owner and</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">between titles or media outlets as a means of protecting plurality. There are also respectable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arguments for requiring a news provider with a large share of consumption to adhere to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accuracy standards and perhaps to have strong internal governance mechanisms to ensure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the organisation meets the highest standards of journalism, thus protecting the public,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both as consumers of news and as potential subjects of reporting. It is, of course, possible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that one way for an organisation to demonstrate that it was meeting any such requirement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be for it to be a member of a recognised self-regulatory body that required the same</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards, and requiring such membership might form part of a package of remedies.</span>

<h2>5. What should trigger a review?</h2>

<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Under the Communications Act 2003 the public interest in plurality can only be invoked when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a relevant merger or takeover occurs. Ofcom provided advice to the Secretary of State as part</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of its Public Interest Test in relation to the BSkyB/NewsCorp merger that the current regime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might no longer be equipped to deliver Parliament&#8217;s policy objective of ensuring sufficient</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">plurality of media ownership because it was not capable of responding to certain types of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">market development such as market exits or organic growth.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This concern about the need for the plurality regime to be able to take organic growth into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">account was echoed by other witnesses. Harriet Harman proposed both that Ofcom should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">carry out a regular plurality review,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup> and that it should have the power to ask the Competition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commission to instigate a review in between regular reviews should an issue of monopoly</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">arise.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-3"><a href="#para5-3" name="para5-3">5.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clegg expressed a concern that the plurality considerations in the Communications Act</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2003 are only triggered at the point of a merger or acquisition. He regards this as a significant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gap in the protection of plurality as:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref49" href="#footnote49">49</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;size isn&#8217;t just determined at the point of a transaction. It can, if you like, creep up on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you through the success of a particular media group just increasing its market share.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-4"><a href="#para5-4" name="para5-4">5.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He suggested that it might be better to have a mechanism to allow an independent regulator</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to trigger a market review by the Competition Commission, taking into account plurality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-5"><a href="#para5-5" name="para5-5">5.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Secretary of State asked Ofcom to consider what could trigger a plurality review in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">absence of a merger. Ofcom identified two different potential types of trigger: a metric-based</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">trigger, which would require a review to be carried out if a particular metric was breached;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and a time-based trigger, which would require a review to be carried out automatically on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a periodic basis.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">51</a></sup> A metric-based trigger would require agreement on both the metrics to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be used and the level at which the trigger would act. Ofcom concluded that the complexity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involved in setting a metric-based trigger was such that a time-based trigger would be better,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">providing a high degree of simplicity, transparency and certainty to the market.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref52" href="#footnote52">52</a></sup> In order to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ensure that reviews take place sufficiently often to pick up significant changes, and with a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficient gap to avoid the risk of a perpetual review cycle, Ofcom propose that regular media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">plurality reviews should take place every four or five years.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-6"><a href="#para5-6" name="para5-6">5.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom also considered whether event-based triggers, such as the closure of a media outlet,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be used. On the one hand, the effects of a closure may take some time to become</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the effects might not come under scrutiny for some time. Ofcom conclude that there might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be merit in introducing an exit trigger if an appropriate mechanism can be designed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref54" href="#footnote54">54</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-7"><a href="#para5-7" name="para5-7">5.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom also considered whether the existing merger-based trigger should remain. This raises</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">questions about the risk of merger-based and time-based reviews overlapping. Ofcom also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">point out that, under the current regime, Ministers have discretion over whether a merger-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">based plurality review should take place or not. Again, this would need further thought in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system otherwise based around an automatic time-trigger.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref55" href="#footnote55">55</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-8"><a href="#para5-8" name="para5-8">5.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, Ofcom considered whether they, or Ministers, should have discretion to trigger a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">review. The advantage of allowing discretion is that it introduces some flexibility into the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system and provides the potential to target a review on a particular concern. The disadvantage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is that discretion has the potential to be subjective and can lead to excessive lobbying and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">market uncertainty. Ofcom recommended against allowing either Ministers or the regulator</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to have discretion to trigger a review as long as a provision is introduced for periodic reviews</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">every four or five years.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref56" href="#footnote56">56</a></sup></span>

<h3>Alternative approach using the Competition Regime</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-9"><a href="#para5-9" name="para5-9">5.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is also another possible approach to how and when to carry out a review. The Enterprise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Regulatory Reform Bill (ERR), currently before the House of Lords, makes changes to how</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest issues are to be dealt with in the context of markets (as opposed to mergers).</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This has the potential to be another way of addressing the issue of plurality concerns that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could arise as a result of organic growth rather than a specific transaction.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-10"><a href="#para5-10" name="para5-10">5.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Where there are competition concerns about a market, or across markets, the Competition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commission can instigate a market study, which will look at whether there are competition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues in the market that need to be addressed. Under the new regime, if the Secretary of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">State considers that there may also be a public interest issue in the market he will be able</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to issue a public interest intervention notice which would have the effect of requiring the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to include the public interest issues in their market</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">study report to the Secretary of State.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-11"><a href="#para5-11" name="para5-11">5.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When the Secretary of State receives the market study report, he or she is then in a position</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to decide if the public interest issue is relevant. If not the CMA proceeds as for an ordinary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reference. If the public interest (PI) issue is relevant then the Secretary of State has three</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">options. The first is that a &#8216;restricted PI reference&#8217; can be made, meaning that the CMA would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">look at the competition issues only, leaving the Secretary of State to make his own assessment</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the PI issues. Secondly, a full PI reference can be instituted, meaning that the CMA looks</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at both competition and PI issues and makes recommendations on remedies. Finally, a full PI</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reference can be made and a PI expert, or experts, can be appointed to look at the PI issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and feed into the CMA report. The CMA report would then cover both competition and PI</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues, taking account of the expert advice, and recommend remedies. In all these cases</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Secretary of State is required to accept the CMA&#8217;s findings in respect of the competition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues but has the discretion to make a decision on whether to make a public interest finding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, if so, what remedies to implement. If the CMA concludes that there are no competition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues that require further examination, the matter goes no further.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">As currently drafted in the ERR Bill this regime has no application to media plurality. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only public interest issue that can be raised by the Secretary of State in relation to a markets</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation is national security. However, it would be possible for the need for media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">plurality to be introduced as an additional public interest issue. This would allow the CMA</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to look at media markets from a plurality perspective at any point when competition issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arise, and would ensure that the full range of competition remedies were available to deal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with any problems identified. Such remedies could, for example, include a requirement to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a member of a recognised regulatory body.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-13"><a href="#para5-13" name="para5-13">5.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The potential disadvantage is that this process relies on the existence of a competition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">problem before the Secretary of State can take action to remedy a plurality concern. Given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that I have accepted the argument that plurality is likely to become a matter for concern at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lower levels of concentration than would necessarily give rise to competition concerns, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is also possible that relying on an approach of this sort could allow excessive loss of voice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because a competition threshold was not breached. I also note that Ofcom argued that there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be market benefits from a regular plurality review, rather than a power to review when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary, because of the risk of market uncertainty from ad-hoc reviews and the extremely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political nature of the issue that would lead to constant lobbying for a review, recognising</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the proposal for a regular plurality review is more closely focussed on plurality issues.</span>

<h3>Conclusions on plurality reviews</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-14"><a href="#para5-14" name="para5-14">5.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These are largely technical regulatory issues on which I see no need to reach a definitive view.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The need to have a mechanism to take account of organic growth and market exists seems</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unarguable, but the precise mechanism for doing so is essentially a technical issue on which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry is not best placed to reach a definitive conclusion. Ofcom&#8217;s suggestions about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nature of triggers for a review and the need for a regular review of plurality seem sensible.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The possibility of using the competition regime may equally have merit. It does seem to me</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unlikely that the two regimes could co-exist without causing considerable uncertainty and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">riskofcompetingreviews,runbydifferentbodies,comingupwithdifferentrecommendations.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I  therefore  recommend  that  the  Government  should  consider  whether  periodic </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">plurality reviews or an extension to the public interest test within the markets regime </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">in competition law is most likely to provide a timely warning of, and response to, </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">plurality concerns that develop as the result of organic growth recognising that the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">proposal for a regular plurality review is more closely focussed on plurality issues.</span>

<h2>6. Who should be responsible for decisions?</h2>

<p id="para-id-6-1"><a href="#para6-1" name="para6-1">6.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Potentially the most significant of the questions on plurality is who should be responsible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for decisions on what happens and when. Many of the politicians who gave evidence to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry had a view on this, some, of course, speaking from recent experience of the difficulties</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the involvement of politicians in such decisions can give rise to. The majority view was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the very fact that plurality is a public interest consideration makes it important that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ministers continue to have the decision taking role.</span>
<a name="page1473"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-6-2"><a href="#para6-2" name="para6-2">6.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Rt Hon Ed Miliband MP said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref57" href="#footnote57">57</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;My suggestion on this &#8211; I have a concrete suggestion on this &#8211; is that &#8211; I believe that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there is a case for saying that if a politician wants to depart from the recommendations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the Competition Commission or Ofcom, whoever it is, that decision should be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">challengablebyappeal.Soinotherwords,ifI&#8217;mtheministerandIgetrecommendations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from the Competition Commission that a bid should be blocked or should go ahead,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and I take a different view, then there should be recourse to the Competition Appeals</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Tribunal to say not simply was it a reasonable decision but on the merits.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-3"><a href="#para6-3" name="para6-3">6.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clegg said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref58" href="#footnote58">58</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;So I think there is a big case to tighten up the remit given to a Secretary of State,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but I nonetheless think at the end of the day it is a good thing in a Parliamentary</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">democracy to have people who are accountable to Parliament who have to explain</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">why that decision was taken and inasmuch as they have any discretion within what I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hope will be tighter definitions, why they chose to exercise discretion one way or the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">other.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-4"><a href="#para6-4" name="para6-4">6.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Cable also felt that politicians should have a role to play in these decisions:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s right that politicians are involved &#8211; elected politicians are involved in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">process. As we described the first stage of my interview, there is a series of checks</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and balances built in, there is a major role for the regulators, but elected politicians,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ministers, have a role in the process, and I think that&#8217;s absolutely right. I think it&#8217;s right</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">because when we&#8217;re talking about matters of public interest, we&#8217;re making qualitative</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">judgments. We&#8217;re not following a sort of quantitative metric, which is what one would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">normally do with, say, a competition case, and I think it&#8217;s right that those decisions be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">made by people who are &#8211; have legitimacy through the democratic process, who are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">accountable to Parliament.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think where we do have a genuine public interest choice to make, I think it is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">appropriate in a democracy that we involve the politicians rather than some kind of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">platonic guardians who are in some sense isolated from the political process.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-5"><a href="#para6-5" name="para6-5">6.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt, however, took a rather different view:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref61" href="#footnote61">61</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There is an argument that politicians should make decisions on media plurality</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">because any such decision is, by its nature, more subjective than an economically</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">based competition test. There is also a view that because of the importance of media</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">plurality decisions should only be taken by elected politicians. I do not share this view.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">This is not because I believe it is impossible for politicians to act in an impartial manner</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; I believe I did. But even when they do it is almost impossible to persuade elements of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the public that justice is being done and being seen to be done.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">presumably to address the same issue. I believe serious consideration should be given</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to adopting the same approach with respect to decisions on media plurality.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-6"><a href="#para6-6" name="para6-6">6.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt, as Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, asked Ofcom to consider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what alternatives exist in relation to who should take the final decisions in relation to, for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">example, the application of remedies.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref62" href="#footnote62">62</a></sup> Ofcom refrained from providing a view on this matter,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considering, very properly, that it is a matter for Parliament to decide, not for a regulator</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to opine on. The current regime places the trigger for a plurality review in the hands of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State, who then has to take a decision on whether or not to refer the merger</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Competition Commission for a second stage review. The Secretary of State is also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsible, having received advice from the Competition Commission, for making a finding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on whether the merger would operate against the public interest and whether to impose</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remedies and what those remedies should be.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-7"><a href="#para6-7" name="para6-7">6.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom take the view that, in relation to public interest merger reviews, it is important to retain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a discretionary trigger in order to minimise the burden on industry. The report, however, sits</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">firmly on the fence as to whether that trigger should be in Ministerial hands or elsewhere.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the one hand, it is argued, where a decision requires a high degree of judgement it may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be more appropriate for a democratically-elected decision-maker to exercise the discretion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rather than a regulatory body. This, says Ofcom, is a choice for Parliament to make.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref63" href="#footnote63">63</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-8"><a href="#para6-8" name="para6-8">6.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Along with other aspects of this Report, I agree that this is a choice for Parliament to make.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However,bearinginmindthecontextwithinwhichthispartoftheInquiryhasbeenconducted,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I consider that it is appropriate that I express a view for the Government and Parliament to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consider. The public interest process relating to the NewsCorp/BSkyB merger has certainly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">demonstrated just how pressured the role of decision-maker is in this context. The volume</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of lobbying on both Secretaries of State involved, principally from NewsCorp but also from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the coalition (known as the Alliance) ranged against the merger, was immense. The highly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicised nature of these decisions, precisely because they deal with media owners, means</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that they are always likely to be made in a fraught environment.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-9"><a href="#para6-9" name="para6-9">6.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Arguments have been made that every politician will have what might be termed baggage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(whether as a result of prior dealings with the press or otherwise) in relation to the media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">market that could make them unable to carry out a quasi judicial function in this regard.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, I do not accept the assumption behind this proposition. Certainly, politicians may well</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have strong views in relation to the media market (as on many other issues), but it is entirely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conceivable that they can put all irrelevant matters aside and exercise a quasi-judicial role</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to the public interest: in relation to a large number of issues, it would be very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disturbing if they could not. Second, it is surely false to hope that if the decision were to be</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">remitted to a regulator, that the regulator would not also have similarly strong views. It is in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the nature of large media organisations that every one of us is exposed to their output on a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regular basis and we all have views (and, in some cases, perhaps prejudices) that might affect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such a decision if allowed to do so.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is equally clear that the current system is less than ideal. The experience of the NewsCorp/</span>

<a name="page1475"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">BSkyB merger shows nothing if it does not reveal that fact. Under the current regime the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State makes his first referral decision without the benefit of any formal advice.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thereafter, advice is available from the independent regulators to provide a guide through</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the subsequent decisions.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend that, before making a referral decision, the Secretary of State should </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">consult relevant parties as to the arguments for and against a referral, and should be </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">required to make public his reasons for reaching a decision one way or the other. This </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">would provide a buffer against the criticism that a referral might be made for purely </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">political reasons, and offer a welcome degree of transparency as to the concerns that </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">have led to any referral.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-11"><a href="#para6-11" name="para6-11">6.11</a></p>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">In relation to subsequent decisions, I recommend, likewise, that the Secretary of State </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">should remain responsible for public interest decisions in relation to media mergers. </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">However, as with the first stage, there would be an advantage in introducing a degree </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">of  further  transparency  to  the  process.  At  present  the  Secretary  of  State  simply </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">receives  advice  from  Ofcom  and  the  Competition  Commission  and  then  makes  a </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">decision. I recommend that the Secretary of State should be required either to accept </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">the advice provided by the independent regulators, or to explain why that advice has </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">been rejected. At the same time, whichever way the Secretary of State decides the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">matter, the nature and extent of any submissions or lobbying to which the Secretary </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">of State and his officials and advisors had been subject should be published: the fact </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">of having to record such contacts would itself act as a restraint both upon lobbyists </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">and politicians and serve to remind each of the quasi-judicial nature of the decision </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">being made. </span>

<p id="para-id-6-12"><a href="#para6-12" name="para6-12">6.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the surface, this might not appear to make much change to the current provision, but I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">believethatitdoes.IftheSecretaryofStateisrequiredtoarticulateandpublishthesubmissions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">received and also the reasons for rejecting the independent advice of the regulator, thereby</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">giving the opportunity to those adversely affected by the decision, if so advised, to mount a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">challenge by way of judicial review, it will ensure both the highest standards of probity and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that a very rigorous test is applied to the reasoning behind the eventual position. This would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not prevent a Secretary of State from rejecting the advice of the independent regulators if he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or she believes, and can demonstrate and articulate, that it is in the public interest to do so,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but it would require a real and convincing public interest explanation to exist.</span>
