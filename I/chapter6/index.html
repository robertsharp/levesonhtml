<h1>Chapter 6<br/>
MEDIA POLICY: THE BSKYB BID</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 15 June 2010 News Corporation (News Corp) announced its bid to acquire those shares in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">British Sky Broadcasting plc (BSkyB) which it did not already own and thus triggered a need</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), the Rt Hon Vince Cable MP,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to consider the media plurality test introduced by amendment into the Enterprise Act 2002</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at s58(2C).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> As is well known, Dr Cable&#8217;s consideration of the bid became the subject of public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">controversy on 21 December 2010 as a result of comments which he made to undercover</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reporters from the Daily Telegraph about Rupert Murdoch and News International (NI). Those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">comments, which gave at least the appearance of bias against News Corp, prompted the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prime Minister immediately to intervene and transfer responsibility for considering the bid to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the then Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, the Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt MP.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The choice of Mr Hunt itself prompted questions from some quarters because he had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">previously commented in positive terms about the bid and was believed to be well disposed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">towards News Corp.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> The bid returned to the public spotlight in July 2011, after the phone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking scandal had broken in earnest, when an Opposition Day Motion was tabled: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> This</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">House believes that it is in the public interest for Rupert Murdoch and News Corp to withdraw</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">their bid for BSkyB<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> In</span><span style="font-style:normal"> these</span><span style="font-style:normal"> very</span><span style="font-style:normal"> adverse</span><span style="font-style:normal"> circumstances</span><span style="font-style:normal"> News</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Corp</span><span style="font-style:normal"> withdrew</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> bid</span><span style="font-style:normal"> shortly</span></span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Significantfurtherevidenceaboutthebid,andinparticulartherelationshipbetweenpoliticians</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the press in relation to it, came to light during the course of the Inquiry. Exhibit KRM18</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Mr Murdoch&#8217;s witness statement contained 161 pages of email traffic evidencing News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Corp&#8217;s lobbying effort. On their face, these emails appeared to show direct private contact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between Mr Hunt and News Corp&#8217;s then Director of Public Affairs, Europe, Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Michel.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel gave evidence to the effect that, in fact, the overwhelming majority of the contact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was with others at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), predominantly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Adam Smith, then a Special Adviser (SpAd) to Mr Hunt. These documents, together with text</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and telephone records which were subsequently sought by, and disclosed to, the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">demonstrate a sustained behind the scenes lobbying campaign by News Corp, in support of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its bid wholly to own BSkyB, which the Inquiry investigated by calling relevant witnesses.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The publication of KRM18 by the Inquiry aroused very considerable public interest and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">immediately sparked a political debate. On 24 April 2012 Mr Hunt wrote to the Inquiry</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">requesting that his evidence be taken earlier than had been programmed, but the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained that it needed to hear all relevant testimony bearing on the issues before Mr Hunt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could fairly and properly provide his own account. The Speaker of the House of Commons</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">permitted urgent questions to be put to the Prime Minister about Mr Hunt on 30 April</span>




 <span style="font-size: 15px;">2012. In those circumstances it was necessary for the Inquiry, on more than one occasion,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to make absolutely clear why it was taking evidence about the bid, its approach and, just as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">importantly, those questions which fell outside its remit. On 23 April 2012 I said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I understand the very real public interest in the issues that will be ventilated by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the evidence. I also recognise the freedom that permits what is said to be discussed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the subject of comment in whatever way is thought fit, and I shall approach the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relationship between the press and politicians from an entirely non-partisan judicial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">perspective, which I have no doubt is the reason that I was given this remit. I would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hope that this approach will be made clear&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 10 May 2012 I explained what I would and would not be looking at and why:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I will look at the facts surrounding the News Corp bid for the remaining shares of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">BSkyB. I will do so in order to investigate the culture, practices and ethics of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relationship between the press and the politicians. It was because of the need to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">examine the facts fairly that on 25 April I spoke about the need to hear every side of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">story, and although I had seen requests for other inquiries and other investigations, it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">seemed to me that the better course was to allow this Inquiry to proceed. That may</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cause me to look at the Ministerial Code and its adequacy for the purpose, but I will</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not be making a judgment on whether there has been a breach of it. That is simply</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not my job and I have no intention of going outside the terms of reference that have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been set for me.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">For the avoidance of doubt, I see the significance of the way the bid was handled both</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by the Secretary of State for Business Innovation and Skills and the Secretary of State</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport as evidencing manifestations, to return to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">terms of reference, of the relationships between a media interest and politicians and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the conduct of each&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The publication of KRM18 led to calls for other inquiries and other investigations. On 25 April</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2012 I expressed the view that it would better to allow the Inquiry to proceed:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In due course, we will hear all the relevant evidence from all the relevant witnesses,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and when I report, I will then make findings that are necessary for me to fulfil the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">terms of reference the Prime Minister has set for me. In the mean time, although I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have seen requests for other inquiries and other investigations, it seems to me that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the better course is to allow this Inquiry to proceed. When it is concluded, there will</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">doubtless be opportunities for consideration to be given to any further investigation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that is then considered necessary&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I returned to the subject of other inquiries and investigations on 15 May 2012 in the light of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significant activity in Parliament arising from the publication of KRM18 during the intervening</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">period. I fully recognised on that occasion the sovereignty of Parliament to determine its own</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proceedings, but explained how a Parliamentary investigation of the same events as were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being investigated by the Inquiry, conducted in advance of, or concurrently with, the Inquiry&#8217;s</span>



 <span style="font-size: 15px;">work risked making it impossible for the Inquiry to investigate this part of the evidence in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accordance with its duty of fairness pursuant to s17(3) Inquiries Act 2005.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> In the event,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Members of Parliament decided not to proceed in parallel with the Inquiry, and the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has continued as intended.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This subsection of the Report does not seek to provide a comprehensive history or critique of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the bid. Rather, it considers the relationship between the national press and politicians during</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the course of the bid and the conduct of each, including the ways in which the relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was conducted.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> It explores the relevant interactions, how the competing parts of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sought to advance their interests, and how the politicians conducted the process of applying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the cross media public interest plurality test. It seeks to identify the issues of concern which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arose during the process of applying the statutory test with a view to identifying lessons to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be learned. These lessons are directly relevant not only to the future conduct of the national</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press and politicians in relation to one another but also to the question as to how best to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ensure the maintenance of sufficient plurality in the media.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Scrutiny of the bid in this way raises many questions. Perhaps the most important question is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whatrole,ifany,shouldpoliticiansplayincrossmediapluralitydecisions?Alsoforconsideration</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are: how did the statutory test work? Was it necessary? Does it require alteration or change?</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">How and why did the problems with process at both BIS and DCMS occur? What can be done</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to prevent a recurrence of such problems? Consideration is also given to whether or not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was an explicit arrangement between Mr Murdoch and any Conservative politician in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to the handling or outcome of the bid. It is right though to state at the outset that in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fact the evidence did not come close to proving any such arrangement.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Corp. At the launch of the bid, News Corp&#8217;s interests in the United Kingdom included a 39.1%</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stake in BSkyB and 100% ownership of NI. News Corp also wholly owned HarperCollins, one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the top four book publishers in the UK.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup> These holdings were but a part of a global media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">business with interests in many parts of the world, including shares in a number of European</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">satellite broadcasters. News Corp was already generally regarded, for plurality purposes, as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">having control of BSkyB.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-11"><a href="#para1-11" name="para1-11">1.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">James Murdoch explained why News Corp nevertheless wished to acquire the remaining</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">shares:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...News Corporation wanted to expand its holding in BSkyB in order to simplify the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">operating model of the business, to have fewer, bigger businesses, and to focus on</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cash flow and invest in upstream content and creative industries. It was intended to</span>






 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consolidate BSkyB with our interests in the other Sky businesses around the world to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">create the first state of the art, global, 21<span style="font-size: 8px;"> st</span> century, digital pay television business,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which would have centred in the UK. The proposed deal with driven by considerations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relating to the way television is made and consumed around the world and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">benefits of consolidation. We see competition increasingly on an international scale</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and our aim was to combine our interests in a number of our Sky businesses in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">order to compete more effectively with multinational telecoms companies and large</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">technology businesses that have begun to distribute audio-visual programming, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enjoy certain benefits of scale and scope that the individual Skys might not.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-12"><a href="#para1-12" name="para1-12">1.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He expanded on the international dimension, demonstrating as he did so, the truly global</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perspective from which media companies of the size of News Corp view the market:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The proposed transaction would have brought enormous benefits to industry, to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Sky business and its consumers and to the wider economy. We had hoped to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">combine our interests in the Sky businesses in the UK, Italy, Germany, India and New</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ealand to build a world class company, with its headquarters in the UK, I am aware</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that some people in the UK thought that Sky was too big, but we felt that it would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be helpful to be bigger in order to compete with other international companies such</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as Google, Apple and large telecoms companies, all of whom are much larger than</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">BSkyB and have been investing in the audio-visual business heavily on a global rather</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">than national basis.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-13"><a href="#para1-13" name="para1-13">1.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There can be little doubt that the acquisition, if it had gone ahead, would have afforded News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Corp with a significant commercial opportunity to develop a large integrated multi-platform</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media company. The prospect certainly alarmed competitors in both the newspaper and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">television industries who vigorously opposed the bid. They were joined in that endeavour by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">two very active campaigning groups, Avaaz and 38 Degrees.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-14"><a href="#para1-14" name="para1-14">1.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although BSkyB is a satellite television broadcaster, its proposed acquisition was of undoubted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevancetothenational newspaper industry. It offered the prospectof increasedcooperation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between NI&#8217;s titles and BSkyB, both of which would have been wholly owned by News Corp</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had the deal gone ahead. Competitors feared that both subsidiary companies would benefit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from economies of scale, might be able to gain commercial advantage by bundling their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">products, and (subject to the rule requiring impartial television news coverage) share each</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other&#8217;s content.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-15"><a href="#para1-15" name="para1-15">1.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The commercial context in which the bid took place is important. Regulation of media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ownership must strike the right balance between, on the one hand, avoiding the over</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">concentration of media power into too few hands and, on the other, attracting investment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and promoting innovation in a technologically very dynamic industry.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-16"><a href="#para1-16" name="para1-16">1.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The precise timing of the bid was related to some extent to the general election held in May</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010. News Corp deliberately waited until after the election before launching the bid. James</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch told the Inquiry that this was to avoid the bid becoming a political football.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup> He also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained that more broadly the timing of the bid had primarily been influenced by the global</span>



 <span style="font-size: 15px;">financial crisis and was determined by the need for News Corp to amass the very substantial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">funds necessary to make a cash offer. A third and final factor was the timing of the BSkyB</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">board&#8217;s summer meeting:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. I think it was to wait until the election was completed, regardless of the outcome,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">such that a transaction of this size, some $12 million [sic], didn&#8217;t become a political</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">football, and that was the goal. But the primary driver for the timing was really (a)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the affordability of it, being able to do it. We had taken some time to really husband</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">our resources carefully. It was contemplated that it would be an all cash offer and that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">took a little while to save up, if you will, after &#8211; over a number of years. Also, there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was a gap because in 2009 you&#8217;ll recall, with the financial crisis, with the uncertainty</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">around the environment, you know, large scale mergers and acquisitions activity was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a hard thing to get your head around.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">Q. Yes.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. And furthermore, in 2009 &#8211; and forgive me, Mr Jay, but it&#8217;s important because I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think I know where you&#8217;re going, but every summer the BSkyB board, the independent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">directors, meet together to talk through long-term strategy and the like, and we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wanted to do it ahead of that, or around that time when the board was all scheduled</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to have a few days together, so it could be done completely and properly with the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">board.&#8221;</span>

<h2>2. The plurality test and quasi-judicial procedure</h2>

<h3>The statutory framework</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The proposed merger met the threshold for consideration by the European Commission</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under the EU Merger Regulation. Consequently, News Corp and BSkyB were required to notify</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the proposed transaction to the European Commission for clearance. Following negotiations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between the parties, they notified the European Commission at the start of November 2010.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Clearance was then forthcoming on 21 December 2010.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Domestically, the first formal decision for the Secretary of State was to consider whether or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not to exercise his discretion to issue a European Intervention Notice (EIN) under s67(2) of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Enterprise Act 2002. The discretion afforded by that statutory provision is as follows:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Secretary of State may give a notice to the OFT (in this section &#8220;a European</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">intervention notice&#8221;) if he believes that it is or may be the case that one or more than</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">one public interest consideration is relevant to a consideration of the relevant merger</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">situation concerned.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The public interest considerations which fell to be considered in this case were those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commonly referred to as the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> broadcasting</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> cross</span><span style="font-style:italic"> media</span><span style="font-style:italic"> public</span><span style="font-style:italic"> interest</span><span style="font-style:italic"> considerations</span> &#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contained in s58(2C) of the 2002 Act. They are:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup></span>




 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;(a) the need, in relation to every different audience in the United Kingdom or in a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">particular area or locality of the United Kingdom, for there to be a sufficient plurality</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of persons with control of the media enterprises serving that audience;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) the need for the availability throughout the United Kingdom of a wide range</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of broadcasting which (taken as a whole) is both of high quality and calculated to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">appeal to a wide variety of tastes and interests; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) the need for persons carrying on media enterprises, and for those with control</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of such enterprises, to have a genuine commitment to the attainment in relation to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">broadcasting of the standards objectives set out in section 319 of the Communications</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">Act 2003.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When Dr Cable in due course did decide to issue an EIN, the particular plurality concern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which he identified in the notice was that set out at (a) above.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The issue of an EIN triggers an obligation upon the OFT to report to the Secretary of State</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, as happened in due course in this case, media plurality is considered to be a public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest consideration, then Ofcom is also required to prepare a report. Once in receipt of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reports it then falls for the Secretary of State to decide whether or not to refer the case to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Competition Commission for detailed scrutiny. In the present case this was the decision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which fell to Mr Hunt, after responsibility for the bid was transferred to him on 21 December</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010, and it is considered in more detail later in this section of the Report.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The alternative to issuing an EIN was for the Secretary of State simply to permit the acquisition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to proceed, subject only to the European Commission&#8217;s competition decision. In other words,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">simply to allow the acquisition without further specific scrutiny of the possible consequences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the transaction for media plurality.</span>
<h3>The guidance</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As promised by the Labour Government when the media plurality test was inserted by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">amendment into the 2002 Act, and as is provided for by s106A of the 2002 Act, guidance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was published by the then Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in 2004 (the Guidance)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with a view to explaining the considerations specified in section 58(2A) to (2C) to persons</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who are likely to be affected by them; and indicating how the Secretary of State expected the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legislation to operate in relation to such considerations. The Guidance, whilst not binding, is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intended to provide an indication of how the media public interest merger regime will operate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in practice, and the approach which the Secretary of State is likely to adopt in considering</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cases. The Secretary of State should have regard to the Guidance and should only depart</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">from it with good reason. Ultimately, as the Guidance makes clear, each transaction falls to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be looked at on its merits on a case-by-case basis.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In relation to a decision to intervene on a media public interest consideration, the Guidance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provides in relation to procedure that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">invited to submit any views they have on this in writing. In taking a view on whether</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to intervene the Secretary of State will have regard to all available information which,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The exchange of submissions and the oral presentation of a party&#8217;s case (in whatever form)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are not envisaged in this Guidance and, unless the Secretary of State chooses to go further</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of particular relevance to the bid for BSkyB was the policy on intervention in broadcasting and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cross-media public interest cases set out in section 8 of the Guidance. This policy considerably</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">narrows in practice the application of the otherwise widely worded public interest test</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">applicable in broadcasting and cross-media public interest cases:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In principle, the Secretary of State may intervene in any relevant or special merger</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">situations involving media enterprises, including cross media mergers, where she</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">believes that the broadcasting and cross-media public interest considerations are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">relevant.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Secretary of State&#8217;s policy is that, save in exceptional circumstances, she will</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consider intervention only in cases where media ownership rules have been removed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by the Communications Act 2003. These are: ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">...</span>


 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">In addition, the Secretary of State&#8217;s policy is that, save in exceptional circumstances,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">she will not intervene in respect of mergers in areas where there are no media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ownership restrictions and none were removed by the Communications Act 2003</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(e.g. mergers involving satellite and cable television and radio services).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">In exceptional circumstances, the Secretary of State may consider it necessary to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">intervene in mergers in areas where there continue to be media ownership rules or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">where there have never been such rules. The Secretary of State will only consider</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">intervening in such a merger where she believes that it may give rise to serious public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interest concerns in relation to any of the three considerations. During Parliamentary</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">debateoftheseprovisions,Ministerssuggestedthatthesemightincludecircumstances</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">where a large number of news or educational channels would be coming under single</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">control, or if someone were to take over all the music channels. The Secretary of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">State may consider intervention if a prospective new entrant to local radio ownership</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">has not shown a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards in other media or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">countries. The Secretary of State is not currently aware of any other types of cases</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in which exceptional circumstances might arise. She has also taken the view that an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">adverse public interest finding by a previous regulatory authority into a proposed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">merger is not necessarily in itself an exceptional circumstance meriting intervention;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">such cases should be considered in light of the reasons for the adverse finding and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">if the law has been changed to allow the sort of concentration resulting from the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">merger.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The proposed acquisition by News Corp, a company connected with a newspaper proprietor,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NI,ofasatellitetelevisioncompany,BSkyB,wasnotacasewheremediaownershiprestrictions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">either existed or had been removed by the 2003 Act. Under the policy, intervention was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">therefore only appropriate in exceptional circumstances and if the Secretary of State believed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the proposed transaction may give rise to serious public interest concerns in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any of the three public interest considerations. It was not one of the transactions expressly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">envisaged as exceptional at the time when the Guidance was drafted.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-12"><a href="#para2-12" name="para2-12">2.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News Corp was not alone at the outset of the bid in thinking that there was a strong case</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for not referring the bid when regard was had to this test. They did not see as exceptional a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">merger which involved the acquisition by it of the remaining shares in a company in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it already had a significant stake and exercised considerable control. Opponents of the bid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">differed and argued (insofar as is relevant) that there would in fact be a significant increase in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">control with real consequences for plurality.</span>

<h3>Quasi-judicial procedure</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both Dr Cable and later Mr Hunt recognised that they were exercising a statutory power</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">rest of their Lordships agreed) distilled six broad principles of fairness from the authorities at</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">p560:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;What does fairness require in the present case? My Lords, I think it unnecessary to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">refer by name or to quote from, any of the often-cited authorities in which the courts</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have explained what is essentially an intuitive judgment. They are far too well known.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">From them, I derive that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(1) WhereanActofParliamentconfersanadministrativepowerthereisapresumption</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that it will be exercised in a manner which is fair in all the circumstances.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(2) The standards of fairness are not immutable. They may change with the passage</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of time, both in the general and in their application to decisions of a particular type.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(3) Theprinciples of fairnessare not to be applied byrote identically in every situation.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">What fairness demands is dependent on the context of the decision, and this is to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">taken into account in all its aspects.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(4) An essential feature of the context is the statute which creates the discretion, as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regard both its language and the shape of the legal and administrative system within</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which the decision is taken.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(5) Fairness will very often require that a person who may be adversely affected</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by the decision will have an opportunity to make representations on his own behalf</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">either before the decision is taken with a view to producing a favourable result; or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">after it is taken, with a view to procuring its modification; or both.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(6) Since the person affected usually cannot make worthwhile representations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">without knowing what factors may weigh against his interests fairness will very often</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">require that he is informed of the gist of the case which he has to answer.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">From these broad principles it follows that there is a degree of flexibility as to the precise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach adoptedbyaquasi-judicial decision maker,solongasin theparticularcircumstances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the decision the procedure adopted conforms to the broad principles and the decision is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">free from either actual or apparent bias. Bias, whether actual or apparent, will taint and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">usually vitiate a decision. The test for apparent bias is whether a fair-minded and informed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the decision maker was biased:<span style="font-style:italic"> Porter</span><span style="font-style:italic"> v</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Magill.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup> It is important to recognise the significance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the words &#8220;a real possibility of bias&#8221; because they set the threshold for a finding of apparent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bias well below a finding that there is, or has been, actual bias.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The requirement for an independent and impartial tribunal does not mean that a person</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cannot have a prior opinion on the matter in question, so long as that opinion can be and is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">put aside and is not such as to gives rise the appearance of bias. As Dr Cable put it:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Yes. I think the key phrase is that an intervention decision must be taken with an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">independent mind, and I have given illustrations earlier in my political career of having</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">encountered quasi-judicial decision-making before. I think with an independent mind</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">doesn&#8217;t mean with a blank mind. Most people in public life have views, opinions.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Probably, if they&#8217;re politicians, those opinions and views have been on the record, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the requirement on me and people in this position is to set those on one side for the</span>


 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sake of making this decision, to consider representations, the evidence, the facts, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decide on that and only on that.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-16"><a href="#para2-16" name="para2-16">2.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An obvious but important feature of the quasi-judicial function which the Secretary of State</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exercises in relation to the regulation of media mergers is that the decision is his alone and is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not a matter for collective cabinet decision. It is not a political decision.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-17"><a href="#para2-17" name="para2-17">2.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Crucially, the decision maker must address the appropriate test, taking into account all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant evidence and, equally as important, ignoring all irrelevant evidence. Thus, when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">applying the media plurality test, wider political and economic considerations are irrelevant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and must be ignored.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-18"><a href="#para2-18" name="para2-18">2.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is against these requirements that the conduct and consideration of the bid first by Dr Cable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and then by Mr Hunt, their advisers and officials, fall to be measured.</span>
<h3>Precedent and experience</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-19"><a href="#para2-19" name="para2-19">2.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The media plurality test had been applied only once previously, in 2006, when BSkyB</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had acquired shares in ITV plc.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup> There was therefore limited practical experience of its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">application, no firmly established practice for conducting the test, and the guidance had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">barely been tested. There was, though, in the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(BIS), significant experience in quasi-judicial decision making in other contexts and Dr Cable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">himself had had some experience of quasi-judicial decision making, albeit many years before</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when he was a Glasgow city councillor.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-20"><a href="#para2-20" name="para2-20">2.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Another case, the acquisition of Channel 5 by Northern & Shell, was being considered at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">around the same time as the BSkyB bid. Dr Cable decided not to intervene in that case,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">distinguishing it from the bid for BSkyB:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In my view, a less robust case for intervention existed in relation to Channel 5 and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Northern & Shell. Channel 5 is substantively different to BSkyB in that it is not a source</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of news &#8211; the news programmes that are broadcast on Channel 5 are provided by Sky</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">News. Channel 5 is not central to news provision in the UK. In addition, Northern &</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Shell newspaper titles (the Daily Star, Daily Express and the Sunday Express) have a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">significantly lower market share &#8211; in the region of 10 to 14%, compared to 37% for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">News International titles. On an assumption that there was only a limited prospect</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that Channel 5 would develop the capability to provide news to other broadcasters in a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">similar way to ITN and Sky News, the prospect of a negative impact on plurality turned</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the extent to which plurality might be damaged by a possible closer alignment</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">between news broadcast by Channel 5 and news as covered by the Northern & Shell</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">titles.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in this case, I should not do so. Bearing in mind the nature of the enterprises involved,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and taking into account the Guidance, I did not consider this was an exceptional case</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in respect of which intervention on public interest grounds was appropriate. There</span>



 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were insufficiently strong grounds for believing the merger would actually reduce the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">number of sources of news available to people in a way that was detrimental to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">public interest.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">News of the bid broke early on 15 June 2010. The Press Association reported it in terms which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">make clear the commercial sensitivity of the regulatory process and which are a reminder</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this is an area in which a balance has to be struck between regulation and free operation</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;BSkyB said today that it had rebuffed an initial attempt by Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s News</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">BSkyB said the proposal significantly undervalued the business and called for an offer</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in excess of 800p a share, in part to compensate shareholders for the wait they would</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his evidence Dr Cable described himself as having been in listening mode during this</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Cable&#8217;s account was disputed by both James Murdoch and Mr Michel. In an internal email,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel quoted Dr Cable as having said that: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> there</span><span style="font-style:italic"> would</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> policy</span><span style="font-style:italic"> issue</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> this</span><span style="font-style:italic"> case&#8221;</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">course of answering a broader question about a supportive statement about the bid made by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> ...this</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> one</span><span style="font-style:italic"> part</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> government,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> saying:</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Look,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> don&#8217;t</span><span style="font-style:italic"> see</span><span style="font-style:italic"> any</span><span style="font-style:italic"> issues</span><span style="font-style:italic"> here,</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we&#8217;ll probably be &#8211; it&#8217;s going to be fine&#8221;, which is consistent with what Mr [sic] Cable had told</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">me on the telephone&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup></span>







 <p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not necessary to resolve this conflict in the evidence for two reasons. First, whether or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not Dr Cable expressed a provisional view, he later came to a very different conclusion and he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did so on the basis of reasons which were both proper and well supported. Second, whatever</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">else the remaining evidence about the bid shows, it certainly does not reveal any appearance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of bias on the part of Dr Cable in favour of News Corp.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An internal BIS email suggests that in the conversation on 15 June 2010 Dr Cable had not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ruled out meeting James Murdoch. His subsequent decisions not to do so were to become a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">source of frustration to News Corp:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;At the end of the call this week James suggested he and the SoS meet up at some</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">point, SoS vaguely agreed. They now want a slot in the diary&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Initially, Dr Cable&#8217;s officials considered that it would be unreasonable to refuse a meeting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although they contemplated that the Secretary of State would once more be in listening</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">mode:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It seems reasonable to assume that since the phone call earlier this week, the two</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">companies are closer to reaching a deal and that James Murdoch wants to update the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">SofS and, in the light of their experience in the ITV share acquisition case, would want</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an indication from the SofS as to whether he would use his powers of intervention.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It therefore would perhaps seem unreasonable to refuse their request. The SofS</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should however, be in listening mode and I would suggest that he should follow the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">lines to take (background would remain the same) as provided in my e mail of late</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Tuesday evening. It might help if a CCP official could sit in.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Cable decided not to, and the efforts of Mr Michel to secure a meeting for his principal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were rebuffed:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...Also I understand that Frederic Michel&#8217;s office called my private secretary on a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">number of occasions to try to arrange a meeting but after considering advice I decided</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to decline any meeting&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Cable explained why:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, the name Frederic Michel didn&#8217;t register on my radar, but I was aware that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there was a request to have a meeting, and I didn&#8217;t wish to be disrespectful to Mr</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Murdoch. I do meet major investors. But in this case I thought there were compelling</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reasons not to meet him. First of all, there was a legal risk because the subject which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he clearly wished to talk about was something couldn&#8217;t talk about, that if I did meet</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">him this might be perceived by other parties to be partial in his direction, and I would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">therefore have to see them, and there were lots of them, so potentially very large</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">numbers of meetings which, by definition, couldn&#8217;t have any substance, and &#8211; but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think the key reason was I didn&#8217;t actually think it was necessary, because they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had an opportunity to, through Hogan Lovells, to put their opinions in writing, their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">submissions. They did so on several occasions.&#8221;</span>




 <p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Cable had been invited to News Corp&#8217;s summer party, due to be held the next day on 16</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">June 2010, and had been intending to attend that function. Mr Michel&#8217;s email reporting the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">telephone conversation between James Murdoch and Dr Cable appears to record that at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that stage Dr Cable was still intending to go to the function:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Cable</span><span style="font-style:italic"> said</span><span style="font-style:italic"> he</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> coming</span><span style="font-style:italic"> as</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate to attend and did not do so.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup> Thus, from an early stage Dr Cable decided to avoid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal contact with News Corp either directly in connection with the bid or at all. It was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">open to him to decide whether to intervene on the basis of written submissions. He was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obliged to give Mr Murdoch an oral hearing. It was also prudent for the decision maker not to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be seen to be socialising with one party to the bid whilst the decision was pending.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-10"><a href="#para3-10" name="para3-10">3.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first lines to take, worked up by officials for Dr Cable, wisely advised him not to rush to a</span>

<p id="para-id-3-11"><a href="#para3-11" name="para3-11">3.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Preliminary advice on the substantive decision followed shortly thereafter. Subject to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consideration of any arguments put forward to the contrary by interested parties, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommended against intervention:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Our initial view is that there is no reason to make a public interest intervention in this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proposed transaction since it appears to involve no change in practice to the extent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to which people have access to a wide range of views and opinions. Nevertheless,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interested parties may put forward a case for intervention and will need to consider</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">carefully any arguments that may be put forward on the matter. Accordingly, in any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public statements BIS makes on the matter, it is important to reserve the Secretary of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">State&#8217;s position and not appear to have already reached a conclusive decision&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-12"><a href="#para3-12" name="para3-12">3.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In coming to this view, officials had spoken about the proposed transaction with colleagues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at Ofcom, DCMS and the OFT. Both Ofcom and the OFT are recorded initially to have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unconcerned by the bid, contrary to their eventual positions. The officials at DCMS had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">properly identified that the intervention decision was not a matter for them:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref49" href="#footnote49">49</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We have spoken about the transaction with colleagues at Ofcom, DCMS and the OFT.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Ofcom indicate that while the transaction may give Newscorp increased influence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">over BSkyB&#8217;s output , they already treat Newscorp and BSkyB as one entity for the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">purposes of the media ownership rules provided under the Communications Act 2003.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">DCMS officials had no points to make relevant to the decision on whether or not an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">intervention might be appropriate &#8211; a decision that falls to be taken solely by the BIS</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State. The OFT indicated they did not consider the transaction likely to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">raise substantive competition concerns.&#8221;</span>

<h3>Submissions to Dr Cable</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-13"><a href="#para3-13" name="para3-13">3.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is no statutory duty to consult in relation to a decision on whether to intervene on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest grounds and Dr Cable chose not formally to invite submissions or to meet</span>





 <span style="font-size: 15px;">interested parties (including News Corp as mentioned above). Nevertheless, he did inform</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">people that it was in order to send him substantive submissions.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup> Whether as a result of this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or entirely of their own volition, many people and organisations sought to make their views</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the question known to the Secretary of State. He did not initiate any exchange of those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">submissions which he did receive.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">51</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-14"><a href="#para3-14" name="para3-14">3.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first such approach came on 23 June 2010 when Brendan Barber, General Secretary of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the TUC wrote to express &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> grave</span><span style="font-style:italic"> concerns&#8221;</span> about the bid and sought a meeting to discuss the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue: &#8220;...<span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> would</span><span style="font-style:italic"> welcome</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> opportunity</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span><span style="font-style:italic"> myself</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> colleagues</span><span style="font-style:italic"> representing</span><span style="font-style:italic"> workers</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span></span>

<p id="para-id-3-15"><a href="#para3-15" name="para3-15">3.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A response, which took some time to prepare and went through a number of drafts, was sent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on 2 August 2010. It explained the decision which the Secretary of State had to make, referred</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Guidance, and invited the TUC to submit written arguments on the matter.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup> That</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach was subsequently followed when responding to numerous others who intimated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their opposition to the transaction but did not address the specific question which Dr Cable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had to decide.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-16"><a href="#para3-16" name="para3-16">3.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 20 July 2010 Hogan Lovells, solicitors acting for News Corp, submitted an 8-page</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">document which it described as a preliminary briefing and which methodically argued against</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intervention.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref54" href="#footnote54">54</a></sup> Their thinking chimed with that of BIS officials whose reaction is recorded in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an internal email:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref55" href="#footnote55">55</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Hogan Lovells analysis accords with our own assessment of the position &#8211; which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">is:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(i) that the transaction appears to make no substantive difference to the state</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of plurality of persons with control of media enterprises since News Corp is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">already deemed to have the power to influence the output of BSkyB and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(ii) that our published guidance on use of the power to intervene suggests this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is not a case in which we would expect to use the power to intervene save in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">exceptional circumstances. We remain open to argument on the matter but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there would need to be substantive information on which to base different</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">conclusions about the case for a public interest intervention&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-17"><a href="#para3-17" name="para3-17">3.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There followed a growing number of submissions against the bid, urging Dr Cable to intervene,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from media companies and others. On 30 July 2010, Enders Analysis (Enders) produced a 20-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">page submission, packed with statistics, which considered the UK TV and newspaper markets,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and News Corp&#8217;s strategy for growth (as seen by Enders), before identifying three specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">plurality concerns which are set out in full below because the same or very similar points</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">were made in many of the other submissions objecting to the bid:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref56" href="#footnote56">56</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;First, products currently separately offered by BSkyB and News Corp titles may be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">combined in bundles, discounted or provided without charge. For instance, BSkyB</span>







 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could bundle News International titles with monthly entertainment to its millions</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of customers in the UK. If this happens, long-held reader loyalty to titles such as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Mirror, The Daily Telegraph and even The Daily Mail could be severely tested.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">In other words, reader loyalty would be measured by a new and entirely different</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">yardstick than previous competitor options, such as temporary price discounts or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a new supplement. Strategic initiatives of this nature could lead to a much more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rapid decline in competitor newspaper circulations than we have assumed, boosting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">News Corp&#8217;s newspaper market share above 40% by 2014. Magazine publishers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">already know something about this: Sky distributes 7.4 million copies every month</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of its magazine to subscribers of its TV services, making Sky the largest circulation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">magazine in the UK based on ABC data.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Second, the widespread availability of fast broadband is encouraging the rapid</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">convergence of press and television. Today&#8217;s newspaper websites contain increasing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">numbers of video clips and extended interviews. Once the News Corp purchase has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been completed, stories from Sky News (especially video) will presumably be carried</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more and more frequently on News Corp websites. Links to newspaper stories could</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">appearatthebottomoftheSkyNewsscreen.Progressively,NewsInternationalpapers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and BSkyB channels, particularly Sky News, may merge into one stream of fact and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">opinion. If this occurred, plurality would decline, even if the combined organisation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">continued to maintain newsrooms that are nominally separate.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Third, the loss of independent BSkyB shareholders will allow News Corp greater</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">opportunity to influence tacitly or otherwise, the editorial coverage of Sky News</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and other BSkyB channels. The 2006 investigation by the regulators of the BSkyB</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">purchase of ITV shares found no evidence of proprietor intervention in Sky News</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">under its current shareholding structure, but this could change under full ownership.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Today, the presence of strong independent directors of the company, many of whom</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have substantial external reputations, helps protect independence and diversity of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what appears on screen, particularly on news programmes.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-18"><a href="#para3-18" name="para3-18">3.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Enders submissions arrived on 2 August 2010,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref57" href="#footnote57">57</a></sup> on the same day as an internal email</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">records that Dr Cable was questioning News Corp&#8217;s submissions (and by implication the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">views of his own officials) as well as expressing an interest in what others thought about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposed transaction. The document marks the start of a gradual turning of the tide against</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News Corp on the question of intervention:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref58" href="#footnote58">58</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The SoS is of the view that News Corporation&#8217;s lawyers can hardly be considered an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">independent source of advice. The SoS has read strongly argued views to the contrary.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He is somewhat concerned to read that &#8220;OFT does not expect the merger to give rise</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to competition concerns&#8221;. Does this not suggest that they have prejudged the issue?</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Or have they already carried out an evaluation?&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The SoS has also queried what other representations have been received, Have [sic]</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other media groups written letters? The BBC? Are we expecting representations from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">these and others?&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-19"><a href="#para3-19" name="para3-19">3.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his evidence to the Inquiry, Dr Cable stated:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup></span>



 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...In the light of the more substantive representations which began to come in, I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">began to believe that there were genuine substantive concerns about the merger and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the case for intervention should be explored very thoroughly before reaching</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">conclusions on the matter.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-20"><a href="#para3-20" name="para3-20">3.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The internal response of Dr Cable&#8217;s officials was to stick to their original view, and point to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their experience of the plurality test in the only previous case in which the test had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">applied:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...Our own analysis of these questions leads to the conclusion that intervention</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">appearsunlikelytobeappropriatein this case&#8211;asbrieflysetoutinmyoriginal briefing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">note submitted on 25 June. The Hogan Lovells submission on behalf of Newscorp</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">draws much the same conclusions for the same reasons. This is not surprising. We</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">all have direct experience of using the powers to intervene in media mergers having</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">done so in respect of BSkyB&#8217;s acquisition of a 17.9% stake in ITV plc and this heavily</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contested case examined very thoroughly before the courts the limits of the Secretary</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">of State&#8217;s powers.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">...On an initial reading, however [the Enders submission] appears unlikely to raise</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">points that could lead us to reach different conclusions about the merits of an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">intervention by the SofS in either of these cases.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-21"><a href="#para3-21" name="para3-21">3.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Guardian Media Group (GMG) also wrote in opposition to the bid on 30 July 2010.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref61" href="#footnote61">61</a></sup> British</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Telecom (BT) followed on 13 August 2010 with a nine page submission<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref62" href="#footnote62">62</a></sup> and Trinity Mirror</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on 16 August 2010.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref63" href="#footnote63">63</a></sup> Replies were sent to each of these organisations and to Enders. GMG,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which had written only a short letter, was referred to the Guidance and invited to submit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arguments which took the Guidance into account. The other parties&#8217; submissions were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acknowledged and they were advised also to make submissions to the EU Commission&#8217;s DG</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Competition because many of the points which they had raised appeared to BIS to relate to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potential competition impacts.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref64" href="#footnote64">64</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-22"><a href="#para3-22" name="para3-22">3.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 25 August 2010 Dr Cable met Brendan Barber of the TUC at a regular quarterly meeting.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The minutes record that Mr Barber raised the question of the bid but Dr Cable&#8217;s evidence,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which is consistent with the minutes, confirms that the Secretary of State was careful not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to give Mr Barber an oral hearing (which would have been inconsistent with his approach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">towards other interested parties) and simply responded by reiterating the request for written</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">submissions. The minutes state:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref65" href="#footnote65">65</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">unions. BB said that there were practical, industrial issues on the media plurality issue</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which the unions were concerned about. SoS said that there was a careful process to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be followed, and that he had no pre-conceived judgments, but he said he would be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">willing to hear any genuine representation and consider the evidence.&#8221;</span>






 <span style="font-size: 15px;">and Mr Cable&#8217;s evidence was:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref66" href="#footnote66">66</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...I have regular quarterly meetings with the TUC and the matter was raised at my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">meeting with them on 25 August 2010 but I declined to discuss the matter further...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-23"><a href="#para3-23" name="para3-23">3.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Officials next worked up a submission dated 3 September 2010 with advice for Dr Cable who,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">officials believed, was keen both fully to understand the situation and to know:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> would</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a representation which does provide valid grounds for him to intervene look like?&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref67" href="#footnote67">67</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> They</span><span style="font-style:normal"> did</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">further discussion before you make a decision&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref68" href="#footnote68">68</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> It</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> at</span><span style="font-style:normal"> this</span><span style="font-style:normal"> point</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> low</span><span style="font-style:normal"> statutory</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">threshold for intervention was expressly drawn to Dr Cable&#8217;s attention:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref69" href="#footnote69">69</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In summary, we believe that the substantive arguments as to why this merger</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">might be deemed to result in insufficient plurality of persons with control of media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enterprises are not strong. Nevertheless, the legislation provides a deliberately low</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">legal threshold for taking a decision to issue an intervention notice. You need only</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">believe it is or may be the case that the specified public interest consideration is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relevant to a consideration of the merger. The prospect of legal challenge arising at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this initial intervention stage appears low since the process involved is relatively short</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and would not involve significant burdens on the parties to the merger. However,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">issuing an intervention notice initiates a formal statutory process and places you in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the position of taking formal decisions in accordance with the requirements of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Enterprise Act 2002. The nest stage in that process would be for you to decide whether</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or not to refer the merger on public interest grounds to the Competition Commission.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">At this second stage, the evidential threshold is higher and the prospects of legal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">challenge much greater. The evidence you would have on which to base that decision</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">may well be substantively the same as the evidence you have already received in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">submissions from the parties to the merger and from interested third parties.&#8221;</span>

<h3>Counsel&#8217;s advice</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-24"><a href="#para3-24" name="para3-24">3.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Counsel with relevant expertise was instructed on 9 September 2010 and she advised in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conference on 16 September 2010. Legal privilege in that advice was very helpfully waived</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the Inquiry has had the benefit of sight of the instructions to counsel, notes of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conference and subsequent emails recording further advice given subsequently as events</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unfolded.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref70" href="#footnote70">70</a></sup> Counsel took a very different view to that initially taken by officials within BIS. Her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advice marked a turning point insofar as advice given to Dr Cable is concerned, pointing very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clearly in favour of intervention.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-25"><a href="#para3-25" name="para3-25">3.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Counsel advised that it was entirely open to the Secretary of State to conclude that it is, or may</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">be the case that media plurality is, or may be, relevant to the proposed acquisition. It would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be difficult to argue, in the face of submissions from Enders and others, that media plurality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could not be a consideration. The fact that the European Commission would investigate any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potential market distortion would not be a good enough reason for not intervening, if it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appeared there may be concerns about media plurality. Deciding not to intervene would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a conclusive determination of the question of media plurality and would carry a greater risk</span>





 <span style="font-size: 15px;">of successful challenge than a decision to intervene. So far as the Guidance was concerned,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this merger may be regarded as exceptional since it involved a large number of news outlets</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">coming under complete common control (because Sky News provided news to Channel 5 and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">local radio) and was analogous to the example given in paragraph 8.8 of the Guidance. As for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the prospects of challenge, News Corp would be unlikely to challenge a decision to intervene</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, if it did, then it would be more likely than not to be unsuccessful. On the other hand,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the chances of a decision not to intervene being successfully challenged were higher than the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">chances of the opposite decision being successfully challenged.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref71" href="#footnote71">71</a></sup></span>

<h3>Further submissions to Dr Cable</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-26"><a href="#para3-26" name="para3-26">3.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Meanwhile, submissions advocating intervention continued to arrive. BT wrote again on 16</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">September 2010. The author of that letter, Ian Livingstone, CEO of BT Group, referred to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">having spoken briefly to Dr Cable about the bid:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;We</span><span style="font-style:italic"> spoke</span><span style="font-style:italic"> briefly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> about</span><span style="font-style:italic"> this</span><span style="font-style:italic"> when</span><span style="font-style:italic"> we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> met</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recently and I thought it would be helpful if we clarified a few points again as you still be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">considering the matter&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref72" href="#footnote72">72</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> before</span><span style="font-style:normal"> summarising</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> augmenting</span><span style="font-style:normal"> BT&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:normal"> previous</span><span style="font-style:normal"> submissions.</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The BBC expressed its concerns by letter on 20 September 2010.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref73" href="#footnote73">73</a></sup> It is clear that it was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">possible for Dr Cable entirely to insulate himself from contact with interested parties as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this reference to meeting Mr Livingstone and the meeting with the TUC referred to above</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">demonstrate. However, it is hard to see how such encounters could have been avoided. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is all but inevitable that a person in Dr Cable&#8217;s position (and later Mr Hunt&#8217;s) would come</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">across interested parties during the course of their other duties. That is the nature of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">environment in which this quasi-judicial decision making was being conducted.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-27"><a href="#para3-27" name="para3-27">3.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The submissions received by BIS, arguing in favour of intervention, were not copied to News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Corp by BIS. Nor was News Corp given any formal written indication by BIS as to the gist of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the case against it. News Corp did obtain a copy of the Enders submission because it had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been posted on the internet. On 20 September 2010, as is evidenced by an email of that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">date, Hogan Lovells, on News Corp&#8217;s behalf, intimated to BIS that it wished to respond to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Enders submission. They did so in writing in a very detailed letter dated 29 September 2010,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref74" href="#footnote74">74</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arguing that Enders&#8217; submission misunderstood and presented a flawed and misleading view</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the relevant legal and regulatory framework for the assessment of media public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considerations; relied on unsupported and speculative assertions concerning the effects of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the proposed transaction; and was founded on selective and in certain instances, misleading</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest considerations in relation to the proposed transaction.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-28"><a href="#para3-28" name="para3-28">3.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the day on which these further submissions arrived Dr Cable, with the assistance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his officials, was in fact preparing lines to take on News Corp predicated on a decision to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">intervene:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref75" href="#footnote75">75</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;As discussed, the SoS has amended the lines to take on Newscorp. It now reads:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I have received various representations on this issue from a variety of [media] groups.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It is my statutory responsibility to ensure that issues of media plurality are carefully</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">considered in takeovers. Given the [serious] concerns [about plurality] raised with me</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in this case, I have asked the independent experts at Ofcom to investigate the matter</span>





 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and report back to me. [I will not comment any further on this case until I hear back</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">from Ofcom]...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-29"><a href="#para3-29" name="para3-29">3.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The arrival of News Corp&#8217;s further submissions prompted BIS to take further advice from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">counsel and to prepare a submission for the Secretary of State to consider with the further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">submissions. Counsel remained of the view that the grounds to challenge an intervention</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were not particularly strong given the significant discretion available to the Secretary of State</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in deciding whether to intervene, and the non-determinative nature of that decision.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref76" href="#footnote76">76</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-30"><a href="#para3-30" name="para3-30">3.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Officials continued to make ready for a decision to intervene: a draft statement to Parliament</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was prepared on 8 October 2010.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref77" href="#footnote77">77</a></sup> On the same day, an opinion from solicitors Slaughter &</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">May, supporting intervention, was submitted by an alliance of communications and media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">companies (&#8220;the Alliance&#8221;) comprising: the BBC, BT, GMG, ANL, Trinity Mirror and Northcliffe</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Media.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref78" href="#footnote78">78</a></sup> Four of these companies had previously made individual submissions in opposition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the bid.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-31"><a href="#para3-31" name="para3-31">3.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A draft copy of the same advice was later submitted by the Financial Times (FT) on 14 October</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010 together with a letter supporting intervention.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref79" href="#footnote79">79</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-32"><a href="#para3-32" name="para3-32">3.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As with the Enders submission, News Corp was not provided with a copy of, or informed of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the gist of the Slaughter & May advice by BIS. However, it obtained a copy of the draft advice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and sent detailed written submissions in rebuttal to BIS on 27 October 2010.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref80" href="#footnote80">80</a></sup> They were put</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to counsel but they did not cause her to change her advice:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref81" href="#footnote81">81</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Counsel confirmed on Friday that nothing in the latest submission from Hogan Lovells</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">caused her to change her previous assessment of the legal case for intervention and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">risk of challenge &#8211; the existence of uncertainty about the impact on the public interest</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">does not preclude intervention to require a more substantive initial assessment of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">such impacts&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-33"><a href="#para3-33" name="para3-33">3.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The campaigning group 38 Degrees delivered a petition with 18,956 signatories on 14 October</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref82" href="#footnote82">82</a></sup> Officials considered that Dr Cable ought not to meet the group so as to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> preserve</span><span style="font-style:italic"> his</span></span>

 <h3>The decision to intervene</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-35"><a href="#para3-35" name="para3-35">3.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Cable decided to intervene. His decision was made public on the morning of 4 November</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010. News Corp was informed the evening before the announcement of the timing but not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the substance of the decision.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref86" href="#footnote86">86</a></sup> The timing of the decision followed formal notification of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposed transaction to the European competition authorities by the parties to the deal. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State explained his decision in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref87" href="#footnote87">87</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Having regard to the Guidance, my view was that as the merger involved a situation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">where several significant sources of news would be coming under common control</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the situation was at least akin to examples given in the Guidance as to when such</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">exceptionalcircumstancesmightarise.Assuchmyinterventioninthiscaserepresented</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a reasonable and appropriate use of my power to intervene.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I took a decision to intervene which was on the basis of my belief that there was or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">may have been a public interest consideration specified in Section 58(2C)(a) of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Enterprise Act relevant to the consideration of the merger, namely to ensure that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there is sufficient plurality of persons with control of media enterprises in the UK. This</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decision was one for me, and me alone, to take on the information before me. The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decision I took was that it was appropriate to require Ofcom to undertake an initial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation to enable the substantive arguments to be explored more fully.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-36"><a href="#para3-36" name="para3-36">3.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Cable did not seek to hide his concern about the political influence of the Murdochs,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although he maintained that he recognised at all times the legal parameters of the decision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he was taking. He continued:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Having considered all the evidence and submissions, it seemed clear to me that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proposed merger did raise genuine concerns affecting the public interest and that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">these should be properly considered. In my opinion as a politician, I also believed that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Murdochs&#8217; political influence exercised through their newspapers had become</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">disproportionate. The accusation that leading political figures in the Conservative</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Party and the Labour Party had offered disproportionate access to the Murdoch&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">[sic] was widely made, as was the perception that both parties had shown excessive</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deference to their views (as expressed through News International newspapers).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">But in both respects I recognised that I could only act within the constraints of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">legislation as described above.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-37"><a href="#para3-37" name="para3-37">3.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The effect of the EIN which Dr Cable issued on 4 November 2010 was to require both the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">OFT and OFCOM separately to investigate the proposed transaction and report to him by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">31 December 2010.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref88" href="#footnote88">88</a></sup> The OFT&#8217;s remit was to advise on considerations relevant to making a</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">reference to the Competition Commission on competition grounds and to decide whether it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">believed that a European relevant merger situation would be created if the transaction was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">executed. It also had a discretion to advise and make recommendations on the sufficiency</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of plurality of persons with control of media enterprises (because that public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consideration was identified as relevant in the EIN) and to summarise any representations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aboutthecasewhichitreceivedandwhichrelatedtothatissue.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref89" href="#footnote89">89</a></sup> Ofcomhadnodiscretionand</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was required to report with advice and recommendations on the effect of the media plurality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consideration identified in the EIN on the case, as well as to summarise any representations</span>




 <span style="font-size: 15px;">about the case which it received relating to that media plurality issue.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref90" href="#footnote90">90</a></sup> In the result OFT</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Ofcom reported to Mr Hunt and not to Dr Cable because responsibility for the bid was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transferred whilst they were both investigating.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-38"><a href="#para3-38" name="para3-38">3.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Hogan Lovells engaged BIS in correspondence about the reasoning for the decision but, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">line with counsel&#8217;s earlier prediction, News Corp did not go so far as to seek judicial review</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the decision to intervene.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref91" href="#footnote91">91</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-39"><a href="#para3-39" name="para3-39">3.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This process, whilst entirely proper, was confused by the fact that people made submissions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at different times, and there was a lack of transparency arising from the fact that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">representations made were not published by BIS (although in some cases they were published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by those making them). Neither was it necessary for Mr Cable to explain the reason for his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision once he had reached one. A more formal, streamlined process in the future with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more transparency both about the arguments being made and the reasons for the decision,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might help to avoid any potential concerns about bias or appearance of bias.</span>

<h3>Media lobbying behind the scenes</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-40"><a href="#para3-40" name="para3-40">3.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of particular interest to the Inquiry was the behind the scenes lobbying activity related to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the bid. The interactions between those acting on behalf of media companies and politicians</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerning this multi billion pound proposed media transaction provide a good example of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">how easily the relationship can become unhealthy. Under this subheading, the Report seeks,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to the bid whilst it was Dr Cable&#8217;s responsibility, to examine who was lobbying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behind the scenes, why they were doing it behind the scenes, whom they were targeting,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what were they seeking, how were they going about achieving their aims, and with what</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">results.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-41"><a href="#para3-41" name="para3-41">3.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence makes abundantly clear that News Corp mounted a determined lobbying</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">campaigninsupportofitsbidfromtheoutsetwhichwentwellbeyondthewrittensubmissions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which it made to Dr Cable. As a matter of generality, James Murdoch explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref92" href="#footnote92">92</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think in any situation, any business is going to &#8211; yes, is going to try to advocate the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">merits of its case, be it an investment case or a regulatory case, to a wide audience of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">policy-makers who may or may not be in a position to have some input into it&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-42"><a href="#para3-42" name="para3-42">3.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The day to day lobbying effort was led by Mr Michel. In relation to the duties of public affairs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">executives James Murdoch was clear that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref93" href="#footnote93">93</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...Mr Michel&#8217;s job was to engage with special advisers and at a political level with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Westminster, to put it broadly. That is what a public affairs executive does....&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-43"><a href="#para3-43" name="para3-43">3.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel did not act alone. James Murdoch was also speaking to politicians about the bid,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when the opportunity presented itself, and the evidence showed the interaction of others</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from time to time. Internally, a number of senior people are seen copied into Mr Michel&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">emails reporting back his contacts with politicians, SpAds and officials.</span>




 <p id="para-id-3-44"><a href="#para3-44" name="para3-44">3.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition to his single conversation with Dr Cable, James Murdoch spoke to a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">senior politicians about the bid. The first of these was Mr Hunt to whom he spoke on 15 June</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010 (the day on which the bid was launched and James Murdoch also spoke to Dr Cable).</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When asked whether the bid was discussed, James Murdoch could not remember but he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">realistically thought that it would have been:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref94" href="#footnote94">94</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t remember. I think &#8211; but I mean, it was in those days around the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">announcement of the bid, so I&#8217;d be surprised if it weren&#8217;t [discussed], and I would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have taken the same position that I took publicly and that we took with anyone who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would listen.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-45"><a href="#para3-45" name="para3-45">3.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt confirmed that the bid had been discussed. Both at that time and in his evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he did not hide his opinions which were broadly sympathetic to the bid. He was, of course,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">entitled to hold an opinion about the bid and it was entirely unsurprising that the Secretary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of State for Culture, Media and Sport should have a view about a proposed transaction of this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scale in the media sector:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref95" href="#footnote95">95</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I have always been open about the fact that I was broadly sympathetic to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proposed acquisition prior to taking responsibility for it.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I expressed those views when James Murdoch called me to tell me about the planned</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">acquisition in June 2010.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-46"><a href="#para3-46" name="para3-46">3.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Throughout the bid, Mr Michel maintained a dialogue with DCMS about the proposed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transaction. This communication was conducted principally, but not exclusively, through one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Mr Hunt&#8217;s special advisers, Adam Smith. That contact (and contact with BIS and others) is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">primarily recorded in Mr Michel&#8217;s emails, but also in text messages; and it is further evidenced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by telephone records provided to the Inquiry. At the outset of a consideration of his evidence,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is necessary to make two important observations about Mr Michel&#8217;s emails.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-47"><a href="#para3-47" name="para3-47">3.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, Mr Michel&#8217;s emails reporting this contact to his colleagues are very often worded as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if he has had direct conversations with Mr Hunt. As was made clear when the emails were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disclosed to the Inquiry, and as was confirmed by Mr Michel in a statement exhibiting a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">detailed supporting analysis, that was generally not the case. In particular, he maintains that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he had no conversation with Mr Hunt between 24 December 2010 and the end of July 2011</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relating to the BSkyB bid, beyond two formal meetings which he attended as part of the News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Corp team (and which are considered later in this section of the Report). Other contact during</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this period was limited to seeing him very briefly before a dinner and to some personal text</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">messages (which are also considered later in this section of the Report). Mr Michel wrote as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he did as a form of shorthand:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref96" href="#footnote96">96</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;At no point between 24 December 2010 and the end of July 2011 did I have any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">direct conversation with Jeremy Hunt relating to the BSkyB proposal beyond the two</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">formal meetings I attended with the News Corp team referred to above.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Given the absences of direct interaction with Jeremy Hunt which I have just described,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it may appear surprising that within the emails in Exhibit KRM18 there are emails</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">after 24 December 2010 the language of which suggests that I had frequent contact</span>



 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with Jeremy Hunt on the BSkyB proposal. In the emails I use language such as &#8220;spoke</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">to Hunt&#8221;, &#8220;had a call with JH&#8221;, &#8220;JH said&#8221;, &#8220;Jeremy said&#8221; and other variations. I often</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">use the wording &#8220;JH confidential&#8221; as a heading for emails .</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I want to make absolutely clear that such phrases are no more than shorthand for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what I was told by someone within Jeremy Hunt&#8217;s office, almost invariably his special</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">adviser Adam Smith . For the purposes of these emails, I did not distinguish between</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Jeremy Hunt&#8217;s advisers and him personally. His advisers were there to assist and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">advise Jeremy Hunt and it was my understanding that when they told me something,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it was always on behalf of the Minister and after having conferred with him. It was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on this basis that I relayed the information to my colleagues in the emails, using this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">form of shorthand.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-3-48"><a href="#para3-48" name="para3-48">3.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, the terms in which Mr Michel relayed information were often not as accurate or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">precise as they might have been, and he did not always clearly distinguish between what he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been told and his own thoughts. A number of witnesses commented upon this, or took</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue with specific examples, particularly Mr Smith: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> ...I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> do</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> always</span><span style="font-style:italic"> recognise</span><span style="font-style:italic"> them</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be an accurate reflection of conversations which I had with Mr Michel&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref97" href="#footnote97">97</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> In</span><span style="font-style:normal"> some</span><span style="font-style:normal"> instances</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was clear exaggeration. Further, Mr Michel is often relating the thoughts of one person</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about what another is thinking or likely to do, in circumstances where it might either be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">speculation or simply wrong. For this reason, Mr Michel&#8217;s emails have been treated with real</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">caution. Even so, they remain of very considerable evidential significance by providing an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">insight into News Corp&#8217;s media lobbying effort.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-49"><a href="#para3-49" name="para3-49">3.49</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel himself explained:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;...Sometimes</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> would</span><span style="font-style:italic"> add</span><span style="font-style:italic"> some</span><span style="font-style:italic"> elements</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> can</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> helpful</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for the team<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref98" href="#footnote98">98</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-50"><a href="#para3-50" name="para3-50">3.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s evidence was:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref99" href="#footnote99">99</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Were you not surprised by the degree of apparent closeness between Mr Michel</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and Mr Hunt&#8217;s office?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. No, and I don&#8217;t want to say anything against Mr Michel, but I think there could</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have been a little bit of exaggeration there&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-51"><a href="#para3-51" name="para3-51">3.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Cable, when dealing with one of Mr Michel&#8217;s early emails said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref100" href="#footnote100">100</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Would you just allow me to make a general comment on this reference to people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">close to me, because there are continued references to so-called advisers, people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who are close to me. I have no idea who these people are. Nobody was authorised</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to speak on my behalf, and there are whole sets of comments like this which I don&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recognise, so &#8211; just so I don&#8217;t have to repeat that in response to every question&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-52"><a href="#para3-52" name="para3-52">3.52</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the day that the bid was launched, Mr Michel wrote in an email that he had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Had</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> call</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">but he did deny saying that the UK Government would be supportive throughout the process</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and took issue with other parts of the email.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-53"><a href="#para3-53" name="para3-53">3.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A second email stated that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Jeremy</span><span style="font-style:italic"> just</span><span style="font-style:italic"> called&#8221;,</span> and recorded that in an interview for the FT</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt had said that the bid was:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;matter</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span><span style="font-style:italic"> competition</span><span style="font-style:italic"> authorities</span><span style="font-style:italic"> but</span><span style="font-style:italic"> he</span><span style="font-style:italic"> didn&#8217;t</span><span style="font-style:italic"> see</span><span style="font-style:italic"> any</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Sky already. So it isn&#8217;t clear to me that in terms of media plurality there is a substantive</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">change, but I don&#8217;t want to second guess what regulators might decide&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref103" href="#footnote103">103</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> The</span><span style="font-style:normal"> impact</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> this</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public comment had later to be taken into account by the Prime Minister before deciding to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transfer the decision to Mr Hunt.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-54"><a href="#para3-54" name="para3-54">3.54</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The above contacts were the start of a pattern of behind the scenes lobbying extending far</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wider than the actual decision maker, or even his department, but also to DCMS, no doubt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because of its media portfolio and, in due course, to a number of others across Government</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and beyond.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-55"><a href="#para3-55" name="para3-55">3.55</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At this early stage of the bid, it is contact with BIS that was the primary objective of Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Michel&#8217;s efforts. By 23 June 2010 Mr Michel was following up James Murdoch&#8217;s telephone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">call of 15 June 2010 to Dr Cable and working on procuring a meeting between the two. As</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">James Murdoch emphasised in his evidence, it was a face-to-face meeting at which to put his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case that he really wanted:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;...all</span><span style="font-style:italic"> we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> wanted</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> do</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> able</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> sit</span><span style="font-style:italic"> down</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> proper</span><span style="font-style:italic"> way</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">...Please sit us down and let us make our case<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref104" href="#footnote104">104</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> This</span><span style="font-style:normal"> must</span><span style="font-style:normal"> have</span><span style="font-style:normal"> been</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span><span style="font-style:normal"> priority</span><span style="font-style:normal"> for</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Michel</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but he received a disappointing response from BIS, in keeping with Dr Cable&#8217;s decision not to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meet the parties, which he reported by email to James Murdoch in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref105" href="#footnote105">105</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Vince has been advised by his team it would be better to meet with you once things</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have settled down on the Sky process in order to avoid any media questions on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">purpose / content of the meeting.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Vince is keen to meet for a catch-up as you both discussed on the phone&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-56"><a href="#para3-56" name="para3-56">3.56</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The email is not to be read as meaning that Mr Michel had direct contact with Dr Cable, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view of the shorthand that the former was prone to use. It may be that the reference to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meeting for a catch-up as discussed on the phone relates to the conversation between Dr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cable and James Murdoch on 15 June 2010, in which a BIS official had understood Dr Cable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to have<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;vaguely</span><span style="font-style:italic"> agreed&#8221;</span> to meet James Murdoch.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref106" href="#footnote106">106</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-57"><a href="#para3-57" name="para3-57">3.57</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The lobbyist did not have to report to James Murdoch a meeting with Mr Hunt on 28 June</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010 because Mr Michel, James Murdoch, together with Matthew Anderson of News Corp,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">were all present. For his part, Mr Hunt was not accompanied by officials and the meeting was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not minuted, although he thought that the bid would have been discussed. He explained that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was one of a number of such meetings that he held with industry leaders during the early</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">days of his tenure at DCMS:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref107" href="#footnote107">107</a></sup></span>







 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. Yes. I was told by my officials that it was entirely proper to have meetings where</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there were officials present who took minutes, and meetings where there weren&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">officials present and minutes weren&#8217;t taken and it was entirely my discretion and I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had that meeting with Mr Murdoch. I also had meetings with other officials, with the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">chairman of the BBC Trust, the head of ITV and a number of other people when I&#8217;d just</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">become Secretary of State.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Do you believe that the BSkyB bid was discussed on that occasion?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I would be very surprised if it wasn&#8217;t discussed, because obviously it would have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been top of Mr Murdoch&#8217;s mind. I don&#8217;t remember any particular discussions...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-58"><a href="#para3-58" name="para3-58">3.58</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By 28 July 2010, Mr Michel was reporting contact with &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> people</span><span style="font-style:italic"> very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> close</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> VC&#8221;</span> asserting</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref108" href="#footnote108">108</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;-he is keen to be seen as the most pro-competition SoS and as we know he is very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">much anti-regulation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">-on our particular issue, he strongly believes the deal doesn&#8217;t change the market</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">situation or would have any impact on media plurality&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-59"><a href="#para3-59" name="para3-59">3.59</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whether those views really were the views of Dr Cable about the bid at the time is unlikely,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Cable denied that they were.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref109" href="#footnote109">109</a></sup> The views recorded are consistent however with the views</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of at least some of the officials within the Department at that time and with the advice that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Cable was receiving.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-60"><a href="#para3-60" name="para3-60">3.60</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When the journalist Robert Peston asserted on 15 September 2010 that Dr Cable was likely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to issue an intervention notice, Mr Michel turned to DCMS to try and check the position. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">texted Mr Hunt directly, who replied that he did not know anything. Mr Michel then reported</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that reply to colleagues in his idiosyncratic shorthand and in terms which went beyond those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the text which he had received: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Jeremy</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Hunt</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> aware</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> thinks</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> credible</span><span style="font-style:italic"> at</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">did in fact do so.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-61"><a href="#para3-61" name="para3-61">3.61</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel&#8217;s emails to his News Corp colleagues indicate that he began to try a new tack</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">soon afterwards by engaging key Liberal Democrat politicians. On 20 September 2010 he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reported:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref111" href="#footnote111">111</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">A week later Mr Michel had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Talked</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Vince&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> main</span><span style="font-style:italic"> economic</span><span style="font-style:italic"> adviser,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> who</span><span style="font-style:italic"> sits</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Lords,</span></span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">probably Lord Oakeshott.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref113" href="#footnote113">113</a></sup> Dr Cable was clear in evidence that in fact no one was leading for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">him. Whatever Lord Oakeshott actually said, it must have been in a personal capacity.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-63"><a href="#para3-63" name="para3-63">3.63</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That is not to say that Dr Cable had had no contact with Lord Oakeshott. He explained how he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had spoken to Lord Oakeshott and a number of Liberal Democrats including Don Foster, who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also features in Mr Michel&#8217;s emails. Dr Cable emphasised that he only ever sought background</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and context from these colleagues and that he did not seek their views on the actual decision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he had to make:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref114" href="#footnote114">114</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, because I just wanted background understanding of the legislation and how it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had originated. I had no background in media policy...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I wasn&#8217;t seeking their opinion on whether the merger was good or bad or whether I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should intervene, but I did think it was useful to have a background understanding of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the kind of questions you have just been asking me.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-64"><a href="#para3-64" name="para3-64">3.64</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 8 October 2010 Mr Michel reported seeing &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> ...</span><span style="font-style:italic"> an</span><span style="font-style:italic"> adviser</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Cable&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> team</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> business</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there was a strong political influence playing on the pending intervention decision:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref115" href="#footnote115">115</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;-at the moment, they are assuming Vince will refer because of the political pressure,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the heavy media debate and the need for him to be seen as bringing scrutiny to a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Murdoch transaction.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">-there is real unease in Libdem ranks over Coulson and the relationship to NI. Simon</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Hughes, deputy leader, is on a mission to make this an NI issue. The more it is linked</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to NI/NoW, the more it will stay political and toxic...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-65"><a href="#para3-65" name="para3-65">3.65</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The assumption quoted above turned out to be correct as to the result but is not as to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasons for it. Significantly though, it fuelled a growing belief on the part of Mr Michel that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the wider political agenda was important and that advantage might be had if News Corp was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to assist Dr Cable politically. The conversation also gave rise to renewed tactical thinking as to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the best way to refine the lobbying effort. As Mr Michel recorded later in his email report:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref116" href="#footnote116">116</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;-the adviser was very clear that if we try to aggressively push Cable, it will have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a negative impact. But changing the narrative in the main media would help him</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">politically a lot and help him inside the Cabinet .</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">-advised to brief all the key lib-dems in coming weeks and go through the impact of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the transaction is the key since it was made clear that the media agenda has had a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">very negative influence on the decision-making process</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">-Many people around Cable are from the left or Labour and are briefing against us.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We need to engage with them behind the scenes even more.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">-Its the right timing as Parliament is back Monday.</span>




 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">NB: the Coulson/NI issues are agitating Cable&#8217;s political base in a major way and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there is absolutely no upside in trying to use NI in any lobbying. I am seeing the Chief</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Exec of the LibDem Tuesday on it.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">-regarding items we could help Cable with: we should try to help him make his</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pro business arguments, for example supporting his campaign to bring flexibility</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to migration cap and work with his team (I can get the people in the City who are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">helping him to come see us).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Cable needs help in working with the City and we can have a two-way beneficial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">conversation with him.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-3-66"><a href="#para3-66" name="para3-66">3.66</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Political and media considerations were irrelevant to the decision which fell to be taken by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a specific minister in accordance with a test prescribed by statute. But News Corp clearly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">believed that Dr Cable might have been capable of being influenced by these extraneous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">factors and Mr Michel was beginning to contemplate how the company&#8217;s corporate muscle</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might be deployed in order to try and influence the decision by helping Dr Cable politically.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Cable was clear that in fact he maintained his focus on the correct test.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref117" href="#footnote117">117</a></sup> Had he been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">influenced as intended, then the proper exercise of the media plurality test would have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">vitiated by irrelevant considerations.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-67"><a href="#para3-67" name="para3-67">3.67</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the meantime, Mr Michel and Rebekah Brooks had met Mr Hunt and Mr Smith at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Conservative Party Conference on 5 October 2010. Mr Michel reported it to James Murdoch</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> ...a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> useful</span><span style="font-style:italic"> meeting</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Jeremy</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Hunt</span><span style="font-style:italic"> today</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> bid</span><span style="font-style:italic"> ...&#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref118" href="#footnote118">118</a></sup> Mr Hunt recalled how:</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">own view broadly speaking was that I didn&#8217;t think there was a plurality issue, so I would have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">probably expressed some surprise that Vince Cable may have thought there was more of a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">problem<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref119" href="#footnote119">119</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> The</span><span style="font-style:normal"> opportunity</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> plainly</span><span style="font-style:normal"> used</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> lobby</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Hunt</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> hope</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> it</span><span style="font-style:normal"> might</span><span style="font-style:normal"> have</span></span>

<p id="para-id-3-68"><a href="#para3-68" name="para3-68">3.68</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel followed up the encounter by sending Mr Smith information about the bid for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref120" href="#footnote120">120</a></sup> The provision of information which News Corp thought relevant to the bid to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Smith, for Mr Hunt, was to become a feature of their relationship. On this occasion the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material was passed on to Mr Hunt and his reaction to it communicated back to Mr Michel by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">email: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Jeremys</span><span style="font-style:italic"> [sic]</span><span style="font-style:italic"> response</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> this</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8211;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;persuasive&#8221;&#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref121" href="#footnote121">121</a></sup> The effect was not a profound change</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of mind. Mr Hunt was not hostile to the bid. But Mr Michel clearly thought it important to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">keep Mr Hunt abreast of the issue and on his radar.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-69"><a href="#para3-69" name="para3-69">3.69</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 12 October 2010, Mr Michel again spoke to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Vince&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> main</span><span style="font-style:italic"> adviser&#8221;</span> and reported the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conversation back to colleagues by email. The email set out advice to target Lord Oakeshott</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and how to go about it. There was fresh mention that the referral decision would be a political</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">one and advice to keep briefing certain politicians:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref122" href="#footnote122">122</a></sup></span>






 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;-he had one strong advice (as mentioned previously): the most influential person for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Vince now is Lord Oashekott [sic], who is a difficult character and hates lobbying (and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">doesn&#8217;t like our empire either ...) and who Vince talks to more than 10 times / day.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It was suggested that we should try a very soft approach with him; get him meet</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with James Harding to get his views on some of BIS key items, like migration cap,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and get me to pop in at some stage to give him an update on the current battle we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">face and inform his views. It would be a much better setting than a direct lobbying</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">conversation. Do we think it&#8217;s ok?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">-the referral decision will be a political one, especially if tuitions [sic] fees debate gets</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nasty in Vince&#8217;s party and he need something to reassure his base ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">-he also recommended to keep briefing senior lib-dems and key Cabinet members as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we have started to do, to push things with Vince&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-70"><a href="#para3-70" name="para3-70">3.70</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Cable confirmed that he consulted Lord Oakeshott on other issues but not about the bid:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...<span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> consulted</span><span style="font-style:italic"> him</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> other</span><span style="font-style:italic"> issues,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> banking</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span><span style="font-style:italic"> example,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> but</span><span style="font-style:italic"> certainly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> this</span><span style="font-style:italic"> issue&#8221;</span> as<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;...</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">ten times a day or that wider political considerations were relevant to the intervention</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref123" href="#footnote123">123</a></sup> But the perception as relayed by Mr Michel continued to portray the decision as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political and, consequently, it was regarded therefore as one which might be influenced by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wider political considerations.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-71"><a href="#para3-71" name="para3-71">3.71</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">MrMicheltookforwardtheefforttoidentifykeyLiberalDemocratswhen,on18October2010,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he reported back on a meeting with Lord Clement-Jones, the Liberal Democrat spokesman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the House of Lords for culture, media and sport, explaining which Liberal Democrats he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">planned to target next, plainly in the belief that they were people to whom Dr Cable might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">talk to about the bid:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref124" href="#footnote124">124</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...His party is very keen to look at this as a political decision.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We had a good chat re-key [sic] influencers around Cable. He has a little set of people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">around him he will call to ask for opinion and many Lib-Dem, Labour MPs will be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">writing to him to apply further pressure.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It won&#8217;t do any harm to explain our case to selected individuals who Cable is likely to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">call:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Lord Newby &#8211; I will meet</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Lord Oakeshot- said he would be VERY receptive to a message from Patience on this:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Matthew can discuss asap?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Lord Razzal &#8211; I will meet</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Chairman of Business Committee, Adrian Bailey &#8211; will meet&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added).</span></span>

<p id="para-id-3-72"><a href="#para3-72" name="para3-72">3.72</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Cable did not recall any Liberal Democrat MPs writing to him about the bid and told the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry for the purposes of the intervention the only &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> little</span><span style="font-style:italic"> set</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> people</span> &#8221; around him were his</span>


 <span style="font-size: 15px;">officials and lawyers. He did confirm though that the modus operandi revealed in the email</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was an example of the kind of commercial lobbying which happens a lot:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref125" href="#footnote125">125</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Yes. I mean lots of this happened, and one just has to learn to recognise it for what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it is. But yes, I &#8211;and part of my role as being Secretary of State is to be open to people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with opinions, and to engage with them.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">...I supposeMrMichelwasanexampleofalobbyistatwork.I&#8217;mnotmakingjudgments</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about him and how he operated, but that is commercial lobbying indeed&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-73"><a href="#para3-73" name="para3-73">3.73</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel moved next from the strategy of targeting politicians who it was thought might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be contacted by Dr Cable to a more direct, proactive and specific approach. Two politicians</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">emerged whom Mr Michel hoped would actively contact Dr Cable to impress upon him the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">economic benefits of the bid should it succeed. On 1 November 2010 he reported:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref126" href="#footnote126">126</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Mission accomplished.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">-LibdemMP,formerSkyemployee,withmajorSkycustomercentresinhisconstituency</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and around, will contact Vince Cable to ask him to bear in mind the economic /</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investment point of view rather than getting influenced by political games, especially</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in times of austerity and very difficult economic environment for those areas. He</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">will also emphasise the opportunity for Cable to show the maturity of the Libdems</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as coalition partners, working for the long-term, and will draw from the Coalition</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">government experience lib-dems have had in Scotland. He agrees with the need for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this to be looked at by Brussels rather than scrutinised again on plurality ground in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">the UK.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">-Alex Salmond is very keen to also put these issues across to Cable and have a call</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with you tomorrow or Wednesday. His team will also brief the Scottish press on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">economic importance of News Corp for Scotland.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-3-74"><a href="#para3-74" name="para3-74">3.74</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The desire to deploy economic arguments of this sort, based on the economic importance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a business within a community, was wholly inappropriate. Such arguments were irrelevant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the decision which the Secretary of State had to make and could not lawfully be taken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into account. Any decision influenced by them would have been impugned if the subject of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">judicial review. At best Mr Michel and News Corp completely failed to appreciate this. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Salmond&#8217;s role is considered further below.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref127" href="#footnote127">127</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-75"><a href="#para3-75" name="para3-75">3.75</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the days leading up to and immediately after the announcement of the decision to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intervene, Mr Michel had further exchanges with a person or persons whom he described as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an &#8220;adviser&#8221; or &#8220;main adviser&#8221; to Dr Cable.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref128" href="#footnote128">128</a></sup> Mr Michel seemed optimistic that he might be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">able to meet with officials but his hopes were dashed on 8 November 2010 when he reported</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to James Murdoch:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref129" href="#footnote129">129</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Just had a private call with Vince&#8217;s main adviser.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He said he believed there were huge risks for me to meet with him to talk about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">anything that has to do with the &#8220;OfCom business&#8221;, which he rules out completely.</span>





 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Too much scrutiny. They also want to be able to say they took an independent view.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Asked me to be in touch regularly in coming weeks, if only to provide him with any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">evidence / materials we would like Vince / him to read&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-76"><a href="#para3-76" name="para3-76">3.76</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel&#8217;s persistence yielded some useful information when he got an indication (rightly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as it turned out) as to the imminence of the decision (but not its substance). On 2 November</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010 he reported that he had been told by Baroness Rawlings, the Government&#8217;s DCMS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">spokeswoman in the House of Lords, that: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> she</span><span style="font-style:italic"> believed</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Cable</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> preparing</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> make</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decision within a few days of our filing becoming public.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref130" href="#footnote130">130</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-77"><a href="#para3-77" name="para3-77">3.77</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the morning of the intervention announcement itself, Mr Michel was in contact by text</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Dr Cable&#8217;s adviser whom is reported to have texted that News Corp had: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> put</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> v</span><span style="font-style:italic"> strong</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the coming steps in the process, because the intervention decision had gone against News</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Corp.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-78"><a href="#para3-78" name="para3-78">3.78</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel continued to lobby despite the set back which the intervention was for News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Corp, hoping no doubt to increase the chances that the next decision in the process would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be more favourable to his employer. On 9 November 2010 he met with Rupert Harrison, a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Special Adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the terms of his email report to James</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch suggests that he had recently also spoken to Vicky Pryce and David Laws. Whatever</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he was actually told, (as to which I expressly make no finding not least because it has not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been the subject of evidence) what Mr Michel reported did not in fact reflect what actually</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">happened:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref132" href="#footnote132">132</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Vince made a political decision, probably without even reading the legal advice, as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">confirmed also to us by Vicky Price and David Laws yesterday</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I underlined the impact such regulatory process has for us financially; the signals it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sends to major global potential investors. Rupert said the case would be made to BIS&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-79"><a href="#para3-79" name="para3-79">3.79</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A text message from Mr Michel to Mr Harrison on the same day also raises the issue of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Treasury making a case to BIS. It records the former asking the latter if the Rt Hon George</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Osborne would send a letter to Dr Cable on the merger and its economic importance. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Michel went so far as to offer assistance with the content:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref133" href="#footnote133">133</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Rupert, just spoke with James. It would be helpful if George were to send a latter</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to Vince on our Sky merger and its economic importance, separate from the Ofcom</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">process. Do you think it is a possibility? I can of course help with the content. Best,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">fred [sic].&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-80"><a href="#para3-80" name="para3-80">3.80</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Osborne made clear that the invitation to write to Dr Cable was not acted upon:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref134" href="#footnote134">134</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;[Rupert Harrison] says &#8211;and I believe him &#8211; that there was a general discussion that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was not focused on the BSkyB bid. There is a reference in the email to making the case</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to BIS. He&#8217;s checked and there is no contact that he&#8217;s been able to see, between the</span>





 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Treasury &#8211; between Mr Harrison and the business department. So that certainly was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not &#8211; if it was raised &#8211; was not followed up.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He makes the point to me that he wouldn&#8217;t have known whether Dr Cable had read</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the legal advice or not, because he wouldn&#8217;t have had a conversation with Dr Cable...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-81"><a href="#para3-81" name="para3-81">3.81</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel displayed particular tenacity in trying to secure a meeting. After being rebuffed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to a meeting about the bid on 8 November 2010, he entered into a protracted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">email exchange with Giles Wilkes, one of Dr Cable&#8217;s SpAds, seeking instead a more general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meeting.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref135" href="#footnote135">135</a></sup> Mr Wilkes agreed in principle to such a meeting but would not agree to it taking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">place whilst decisions about the bid were pending. When asked when would be good for him,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he replied:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Let</span><span style="font-style:italic"> us</span><span style="font-style:italic"> assume</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> when</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> google</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Vince</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Cable,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;News</span><span style="font-style:italic"> International&#8221;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Sky&#8221;</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">doesn&#8217;t turn anything up!&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Michel</span><span style="font-style:normal"> persisted</span><span style="font-style:normal"> by</span><span style="font-style:normal"> seeking</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> elicit</span><span style="font-style:normal"> whether</span><span style="font-style:normal"> there</span><span style="font-style:normal"> had</span><span style="font-style:normal"> been</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">parties in the transaction have met with you at all since June [Telegraph, FT, Associated, BT,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">BBC. etc.]?<span style="font-style:normal"> To</span><span style="font-style:normal"> which</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> received</span><span style="font-style:normal"> this</span><span style="font-style:normal"> reply:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref136" href="#footnote136">136</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;As it happened, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve talked about this issue with any of them. Of course,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in briefing at Conference, I had to wander into a room full of media people, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people from the media contacted me on other matters. And I know someone senior</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at Sky in a personal capacity, but we have studiously avoided discussing this since it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">became such a hot issue.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;re both equally interested in staying within the bounds of proper conduct</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; forgive my caution&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-82"><a href="#para3-82" name="para3-82">3.82</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel concluded the exchange with a mollifying response before reporting to James</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch that: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Vince</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> disciplined&#8221;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> about</span><span style="font-style:italic"> this</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref137" href="#footnote137">137</a></sup> That was on 15 November 2010. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Michel let the matter rest but he did not give up. He resumed the attempt on 14 December</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010 after Ofcom had published an issues letter:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref138" href="#footnote138">138</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;Just spoke to Vince&#8217;s main adviser.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Neither date I put forward for a meeting with Vince (7<span style="font-size: 9px;"> th</span> or 10<span style="font-size: 9px;"> th</span> Jan) is likely to work.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Vince is out of the country at that time, on current plans.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I was told that he has yet to get &#8220;his full views on the advisability of a meeting &#8211; he</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is very keen to observe all the correct form and may therefore regard the possibility</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with an element of concern until extremely thoroughly briefed on all possible</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consequences.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think meeting, if it happens, will be in mid-January. Let&#8217;s see.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-83"><a href="#para3-83" name="para3-83">3.83</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Unlike Dr Cable, at this stage Mr Hunt had no objection to meeting News Corp, although he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">came to change his mind. When Mr Michel contacted him directly by text on 9 November</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010 seeking a meeting for James Murdoch, Mr Hunt agreed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref139" href="#footnote139">139</a></sup> But before the meeting took</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">place Mr Hunt received advice from his officials. The advice, which had been approved by in-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">house legal advisers, recommended against the meeting because DCMS had no formal role</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the intervention decision:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref140" href="#footnote140">140</a></sup></span>






 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There is no role in the process for the DCMS so we would recommend that you do</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not have any external discussions on the BSkyB media merger nor write to SoS BIS</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about it. If you want to contribute, you could write a letter stating facts backed up</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with evidence, provided it recognises the final decision is for the Business Secretary of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">State acting alone. However this carries risks to the robustness of the decision&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-84"><a href="#para3-84" name="para3-84">3.84</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt cancelled the meeting, explaining to the Inquiry that although he did not think that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contact would have been wrong, it risked creating a parallel process:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref141" href="#footnote141">141</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;ThiswasprobablythefirsttimethatIheardthephrasequasi-judicialorhadsomekind</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of exposure to what the implications of quasi-judicial meant, and we had a meeting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the diary initially and I decided to cancel that meeting not because I thought it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was wrong to have contact with News Corporation, but because I thought they were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">probably wanting to have the meeting with me that Vince Cable had refused to have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with them, and that therefore to have that meeting would be to create a parallel</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">process where another government department is getting involved in the process in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a way that might not be seen to be appropriate.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-85"><a href="#para3-85" name="para3-85">3.85</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The position was reported to James Murdoch by Mr Michel on 15 November 2010 by email:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref142" href="#footnote142">142</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Jeremy tried to call you. He has received very strong legal advice not to meet us today</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as the current process is treated as a judicial one (not a policy one) and any meeting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could be referred to and jeopardize the entire process. Jeremy is very frustrated about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it but the Permanent Secretary has now also been involved&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-86"><a href="#para3-86" name="para3-86">3.86</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Use of the phrase &#8220;very strong legal advice&#8221; is an overstatement of the true position, which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was a recommendation by officials which had been cleared by lawyers.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-87"><a href="#para3-87" name="para3-87">3.87</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt was indeed frustrated and for essentially economic reasons. He told the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref143" href="#footnote143">143</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I may have been frustrated. I was worried about a bid in my sector that could</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">potentially mean that thousands more jobs would be created, and the main</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">protagonist was concerned about the process they were having to go through, so I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">may well have been worried.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-88"><a href="#para3-88" name="para3-88">3.88</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel continued in his email to propose that his principal should instead telephone Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Hunt. It is:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref144" href="#footnote144">144</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;My advice would be not to meet him today as it would be counter-productive for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">everyone, but you could have a chat with him on his mobile which is completely fine,</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and I will liaise with his team privately as well.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-89"><a href="#para3-89" name="para3-89">3.89</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is surprising that Mr Michel, whose own belief appears to have been that Mr Hunt had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">received very strong legal advice not to meet James Murdoch, thought it appropriate to</span>




 <span style="font-size: 15px;">encourage telephone contact. The displeasure of James Murdoch to this news is apparent in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his reply to Mr Michel: &#8220;You<span style="font-style:italic"> must</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> fucking</span><span style="font-style:italic"> joking.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Fine.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> will</span><span style="font-style:italic"> text</span><span style="font-style:italic"> him</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> find</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> time</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref145" href="#footnote145">145</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-90"><a href="#para3-90" name="para3-90">3.90</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The call went ahead. Mr Hunt recalled: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> just</span><span style="font-style:italic"> heard</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Murdoch</span><span style="font-style:italic"> out,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> basically</span><span style="font-style:italic"> heard</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what he had to say about what was on his mind at that time.<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref146" href="#footnote146">146</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> He</span><span style="font-style:normal"> agreed</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> had</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">probably been sympathetic but emphasised that he been careful to observe propriety:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref147" href="#footnote147">147</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, I wouldn&#8217;t have given him any reassurance about the media plurality decision</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that Vince Cable was taking because that was not my &#8211;that was not anything I could</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">get involved with, and I would have made that clear to him, so I probably gave him a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sympathetic hearing, but I wouldn&#8217;t have said that I can get involved in that decision</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">because I had taken and accepted the advice that I couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">James Murdoch&#8217;s evidence was: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> believe</span><span style="font-style:italic"> he</span><span style="font-style:italic"> called</span><span style="font-style:italic"> me</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> apologise</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span><span style="font-style:italic"> cancelling</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> meeting</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but &#8211; I don&#8217;t have a specific recollection, but I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s in the records.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref148" href="#footnote148">148</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-92"><a href="#para3-92" name="para3-92">3.92</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Jonathan Stephens, the Permanent Secretary at DCMS, subsequently explored the legal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">position further, obtaining in house legal advice which fully addressed the relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between DCMS and BIS in relation to the bid:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref149" href="#footnote149">149</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Whilst there is nothing legally which formally precludes the Secretary of State CMS</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from making representations to the Secretary of State BIS to inform the latter&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decision as to whether to refer the public interest considerations in this merger to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Competition Commission, it would be unwise to do so. This is because the task of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">assessing the impact of the merger on media plurality is expressly given to Ofcom,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and because the Secretary of State CMS will almost certainly be able to see neither the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">report itself nor the underlying materials. Furthermore, and partly as a consequence,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any representations made by the Secretary of State CMS are likely to raise the risk of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">challenge to a decision made by the Secretary of State BIS because it will appear to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be purely political in nature (although, of course, it may well not be in fact, and thus</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be of limited assistance to him in making his assessment.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whatever the detail of the telephone call on 15 November 2010 there is no evidence that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt sought to communicate it to Dr Cable. Mr Hunt correctly accepted that he should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not become directly involved in the quasi-judicial process.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref150" href="#footnote150">150</a></sup> In evidence, he recognised with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hindsight that it would have been better for the conversation to have been heard and minuted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by his officials.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref151" href="#footnote151">151</a></sup> I agree.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-94"><a href="#para3-94" name="para3-94">3.94</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel soon pursued the private liaison with Mr Hunt&#8217;s team which he had proposed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">take. In an email dated 23 November 2010 he relayed:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref152" href="#footnote152">152</a></sup></span>









 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I will have a session with Hunt&#8217;s adviser next Wednesday to update on Ofcom process</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and next steps.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Jeremy has also asked me to send him relevant documents privately&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-95"><a href="#para3-95" name="para3-95">3.95</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having established this private channel of communication with DCMS about the bid before</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the decision was unexpectedly transferred to Mr Hunt, Mr Michel later sought vigorously to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exploit it once the decision had been transferred.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-96"><a href="#para3-96" name="para3-96">3.96</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Before the transfer, News Corp fruitlessly continued their lobbying of prominent Liberal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Democrats, still believing that it might indirectly influence Dr Cable. On 19 November 2010</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel reported to James Murdoch:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref153" href="#footnote153">153</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220; Was told today by Cable&#8217;s adviser to approach any meeting with Lord Oakeshott as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a proxy for Vince Cable, an intro. discussion on the substance of Rubicon and possible</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">way forward.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Again, given his position of Chair of Cable&#8217;s business advisory council, he is the most</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">influential person on any decision Vince will make &#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-3-97"><a href="#para3-97" name="para3-97">3.97</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">James Murdoch had seen a prominent Liberal Democrat, Paul Marshall. Mr Marshall informed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">James Murdoch (forwarding an email via Mr Michel) that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref154" href="#footnote154">154</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I have relayed the substance of our conversation to Vince&#8217;s office, but as you know,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Vince is highly independent-minded so I can make no promises as to his greater</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">willingness to hold a meeting...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-98"><a href="#para3-98" name="para3-98">3.98</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 2 December 2010, Mr Michel had conversations with an adviser to the Deputy Prime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Minister and an adviser to the Prime Minister. In relation to the former he reported to James</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref155" href="#footnote155">155</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Honest discussion on the importance for us of getting Labour on board / comfortable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with the transaction as it will influence Cable a lot</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he will insist on the need for Vince to meet with us once Ofcom report published</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">need to support Nick when he makes announcement on copyright which goes against</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">his election promise &#8211; timing end January &#8211; will be very tough for him with youth</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">voters again&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-99"><a href="#para3-99" name="para3-99">3.99</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Tim Colborne, a SpAd working to Mr Clegg confirmed that he was the adviser in question,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but disputed the accuracy of Mr Michel&#8217;s email. Mr Colborne&#8217;s note of the meeting recorded</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">discussion on three topics: the Digital Economy Act; the BSkyB decision making process; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the broadcast landscape more generally. On the topic of BSkyB he said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref156" href="#footnote156">156</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;My recollections of the discussions in relation to BSkyB are that Frederic Michel asked</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">me about how the process was going, and I informed him that I had no involvement in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it, and knew nothing about how it was proceeding. I have never had a role in relation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the BSkyB bid, which was exclusively a matter for the relevant Secretary of State</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(who at that time was the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills). I</span>




 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">further informed him that even if I had known, it would not be appropriate for me to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">speak to him about it. Frederic Michel went on to explain how the decision-making</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">process was supposed to work...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I do not recognise Frederic Michel&#8217;s own account of this meeting as set out in his</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">email to James Murdoch. I have no recollection of an &#8220;honest discussion on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">importance for us of getting Labour on board&#8221;, and I completely reject the suggestion</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that I offered to &#8220;insist on the need for Vince to meet with us once [the] Ofcom report</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">[was] published&#8221;. I would not have offered to do so, and did not do so. When making</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">handwritten notes of meetings, I always mark action points with an asterisk. There</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were no action points arising from this meeting.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is, perhaps, but one example of the need for real caution in relation to the accuracy of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel&#8217;s communications.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-100"><a href="#para3-100" name="para3-100">3.100</a></p>
 About his conversation with Mr Cameron&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> adviser, Mr Michel recorded only one line relating
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the bid:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;On</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Sky</span><span style="font-style:italic"> transaction:</span><span style="font-style:italic"> recognised</span><span style="font-style:italic"> need</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> look</span><span style="font-style:italic"> at</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> only</span><span style="font-style:italic"> from</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> plurality</span><span style="font-style:italic"> point</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to take but it is at odds with the belief expressed in Mr Michel&#8217;s earlier emails that wider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political issues would influence the decision.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-101"><a href="#para3-101" name="para3-101">3.101</a></p>
 When Ofcom published an issues letter,</span> Mr Michel set about gauging the reaction. On<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 14
<span style="font-size: 15px;">December 2010, he reported to James Murdoch in terms which show that he had not given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">up on a meeting:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref158" href="#footnote158">158</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Very good debrief with Hunt on the Issues letter. He is pretty amazed by its findings,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">methodology and clear bias.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He very much shares our views on it.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We are going to try to find a way for you to meet with him one/one before Xmas.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-102"><a href="#para3-102" name="para3-102">3.102</a></p>
 On this occasion Mrs Brooks too was passing on information, conveying to Mr Michel what
<span style="font-size: 15px;">she said was Mr Osborne&#8217;s response:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref159" href="#footnote159">159</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Same from GO &#8211; total bafflement at response.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-103"><a href="#para3-103" name="para3-103">3.103</a></p>
 Mr Osborne did not remember mention of the bid in conversation,</span> and had not read<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Ofcom&#8217;s
<span style="font-size: 15px;">letter, but he did not doubt Mrs Brooks&#8217; account that it had taken place and he remembered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the occasion, a dinner in a restaurant. Neither did he take issue with Mrs Brooks&#8217; evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he looked perplexed:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref160" href="#footnote160">160</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I have read the Ofcom issues letter in preparation for appearing before you today</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and I think that is the first time I&#8217;ve ever read that letter. Certainly it jogs no memory</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and I&#8217;ve done a search of my private office of whether the Ofcom issues letter was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">brought to my attention, and there&#8217;s no &#8211; we can find no evidence that it was.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So I&#8217;m perfectly prepared to accept that there was a conversation; I just have no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">memory of it, and perhaps the reason I was perplexed or baffled was because I hadn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">actually read the Ofcom issues letter&#8221;.</span>




 <p id="para-id-3-104"><a href="#para3-104" name="para3-104">3.104</a></p>
 Mr Osborne was clear that the process was quasi-judicial and he did not seek to influence Dr
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cable&#8217;s decision. Indeed, he made plain to the Inquiry the political reasons why he did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have a strong view as to the outcome of the bid:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref161" href="#footnote161">161</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t have a strong view about its merits because as far as I could see, it was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">just going to cause us trouble one way or the other. Indeed, so it has proved to be,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and I just thought it was either going to offend a group of newspapers and indeed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">broadcasters who we wanted to have good relations with if it was rejected &#8211; sorry, if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it was accepted, and if it was rejected, it was going to offend another bunch of people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who we want to have good relations with.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So I regarded the whole thing as a political inconvenience and something we just had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to deal with and the best way to deal with it was to stick by the process&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-105"><a href="#para3-105" name="para3-105">3.105</a></p>
 Mr Michel reported having seen Mr Foster from whom he said had had:</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> &#8220;Some</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> important
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">feedback&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref162" href="#footnote162">162</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Amongst</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> many</span><span style="font-style:normal"> emails</span><span style="font-style:normal"> reporting</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Michel&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:normal"> conversations</span><span style="font-style:normal"> with</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Liberal</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Democrats, recited above, that of 19 December 2010, relaying a conversation with Mr Clegg&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chief of Staff, Jonny Oates, stands out because the view recorded is unequivocally focused on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the correct test and the correct procedure:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref163" href="#footnote163">163</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Just had a private chat with Clegg&#8217;s chief of staff regarding the ongoing process.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He was very surprised when I pointed out to him that Cable will be tempted to take a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decision with a lot of political influence.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">For him, the referral is not a matter for &#8220;lib-dems&#8221;, it is a matter for the Secretary of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">State in accordance with his statutory obligations.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Said he was unclear therefore why News Corp is seeking out the views of people who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have no locus in the decision making process and thinking that their views indicate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the decision will be &#8220;political.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">For him, senior lib-dems who are going around giving us advice / recommendations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are not representative of Vince&#8217;s mindset and way of making decisions. This is similar</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to what Vince&#8217;s adviser told me on Friday night: until the end, Vince will be keen to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">make up his own mind and not be influenced by anyone.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I told him it was hard to believe given all the feedback we are getting.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Contrary to my assertion, he said the Secretary of State will take the decision on its</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">merits in accordance with his statutory obligations. If we have concerns, we should</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">express them directly with BIS or Ofcom.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-106"><a href="#para3-106" name="para3-106">3.106</a></p>
 The evidence,</span> discussed earlier in this<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Section, shows that Dr Cable did focus on the statutory
<span style="font-size: 15px;">test, took specialist legal advice and made up his own mind. However, insofar as Mr Oates&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intention was to reassure News Corp that the bid was being considered with scrupulous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fairness by Dr Cable, what happened next entirely changed the perspective.</span>



 <a name="section4"></a>
<h2>4.  21 December 2010: Dr Cable&#8217;s comments and the transfer of function</h2>

<h3>The comments and their context</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the course of his work as a constituency MP, on Friday 3 December 2010, Dr Cable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conducted a constituency surgery. Two undercover journalists pretended on that occasion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be constituents and local mothers concerned about the impact of proposed Child Benefit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">changes on their families. More broadly, they sought, and then actively questioned Dr Cable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about, his views on the coalition Government.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref164" href="#footnote164">164</a></sup> He spoke freely about the bid and &#8220;the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch press&#8221; saying (amongst other things):<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref165" href="#footnote165">165</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;You may wonder what is happening with the Murdoch press ...I have declared war</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on Mr Murdoch and I think we&#8217;re going to win&#8221; and &#8220;I didn&#8217;t politicise it, because it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is a legal question, but he [Mr Murdoch] is trying to take over BSkyB, you probably</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know that ...He has minority shares ...And he wants a majority. And a majority-control</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would give him a massive stake. I have blocked it, using the powers that I have got.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">And they are legal powers that I have got. I can&#8217;t politicise it, but for the people who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know what is happening, this is a big thing. His whole empire is now under attack. So</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there are things like that, that being in Government ...All we can do in opposition is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">protest&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Cable did not deny making the comments but wished to explain two factors which he said</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had influenced what he had said. First, he described what had happened in his constituency</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">office, and how it affected the words he chose, in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref166" href="#footnote166">166</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;First,onthateveningthere werehighlevelsoftensionintheofficeduetodisturbances</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">outside caused by a group of protestors who had tried to force entry, and were verbally</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">threatening staff and residents. They were later confronted by the police. I had invited</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in a small group of protestors and had just finished a highly confrontational discussion</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with them. My own lack of concentration in the subsequent interview had a lot to do</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with this abnormal and tense environment. I volunteered strong views on the BSkyB</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">takeover since that, together with university finance, was the issue uppermost in my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mind. I should also draw attention to other comments that were made, recorded and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reported by the journalists which caused me some embarrassment but do illustrate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this factor further. I talked about a &#8220;big battle&#8221; going on over immigration caps, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;big arguments&#8221; on banks, tax thresholds, and civil liberties. I used the word &#8220;war&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">several times. These comments show how this high level of tension had spilled over</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">into the language I used throughout the conversation, and not just when discussing</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">one particular topic&#8221;.</span>



 <p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He expanded upon this evidence orally:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref167" href="#footnote167">167</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think it needs &#8211; in order to explain the rather emotional way in which I dealt with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this and the very strong language, I think it is important to understand there was, I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think, a near riot taking place outside my constituency office, people were trying to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">force entry, we had the police present trying to calm the situation. In order to prevent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the disorder getting out of control, I invited in some of the protesters into my office.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We had a very long discussion, very angry people upbraiding me about Afghanistan</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and Palestine and student fees and capitalism and other things, and somebody was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">waving a camcorder in my face, a few inches from my face, so I was struggling to keep</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my temper in this situation. So at the end of that interview, when I&#8217;d finally seen them</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">out, I was in an extremely tense and emotional frame of mind, and the two women,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who I thought were constituents coming to see me about a constituency problem,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were the next people that I saw. As I&#8217;ve tried to explain here &#8211; I&#8217;m normally very calm</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in dealing with different situations &#8211; I did offload onto them a lot of pent-up feelings,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not just about the BSkyB case that I was dealing with, but about my colleagues in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">government and a variety of other issues in language that I wouldn&#8217;t normally use, in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what I thought was a private, confidential conversation.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Cable next described a very different kind of influence, namely a sense that he was being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intimidated by the threat of retribution through the newspapers owned by NI. He put it in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these terms in his witness statement:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref168" href="#footnote168">168</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Second, the confrontational way in which my personal views of News Corporation,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were expressed was due to reports coming back to me of how News Corporation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">representatives had been approaching several of my Liberal Democrat colleagues</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in a way I judged to be inappropriate. The reports suggested that News Corporation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">representatives were either trying to influence my views or seeking material which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">might be used to challenge any adverse ruling I might make, following the completion</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the Ofcom report. These colleagues expressed some alarm about whether this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whole affair was going to lead to retribution against the Liberal Democrats through</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">News International newspapers. As it happened evidence of these reports was later</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">borne out in an article by Toby Helm in the Observer on 23 July 2011 (which I have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">included in exhibit &#8220;VC1&#8221;). This added a sense of being under siege from a well</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">organised operation. Coming from a party that had hitherto been at best ignored by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">News International, this was a new and somewhat unsettling experience. I could not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">help contrast this behaviour with that of other parties to the case who were content</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to make written submissions or other cases (like Northern & Shell).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">My references to a &#8220;War on Murdoch&#8221; were making the point, no doubt rather</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hyperbolically, that I had no intention of being intimidated. Clearly, I should not have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">volunteered my unprompted opinion, even in a private, confidential conversation in a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">constituency surgery. I subsequently apologised.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He developed this evidence orally, explaining that there were two concerns about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">activities of Mr Michel and others. First, he felt that the bid was being politicised. Second,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he and his party were being threatened with retribution:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref169" href="#footnote169">169</a></sup></span>



 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, perhaps preface my answer by saying I was describing the &#8211; the interview in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my office took place a month after the intervention notice, and I was describing a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">series of reports I&#8217;d had from colleagues, often second or third-hand, but nonetheless</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">plausible reports, of significant numbers of my Parliamentary colleagues in the Lords</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and in the Commons having had interviews with Mr Michel and possibly others, and I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was concerned, indeed I was more than concerned, I was angry, which is what came</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">out in my response, at the way this was being dealt with.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I was concerned on two levels. First, there was a systematic attempt to politicise the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">process, to imply that somehow or other the whole process was governed by the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Liberal Democrats, which it wasn&#8217;t, and I think in his email exchange, Jonny Oates &#8211; it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is there, I think 1681 &#8211; does describe his own interpretation of what was going on as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a systematic attempt by News International representatives to politicise the process.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">And secondly, and actually more seriously, I had heard directly and indirectly from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">colleagues that there had been veiled threats that if I made the wrong decision from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">their point of view of the company, my party would be &#8211; I think somebody used the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">phrase &#8220;done over&#8221; in the News International press, and I took those things seriously,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I was very concerned. I had myself tried to deal with the process entirely properly and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">impartially, and I discovered that this was happening in the background. I frankly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">stored up my anger at what was taking place, but in that very special and tense</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">situation, I rather offloaded my feelings.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">After Dr Cable had given evidence, a fellow Liberal Democrat MP, Norman Lamb, came</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">forward to the Inquiry further to explain the sense of threat. In particular, he recounted two</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meetings with Mr Michel which he said took place in Portcullis House, Westminster, on 10</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">June 2010 and 27 October 2010. He described a range of subjects being recounted on both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occasions, including the proposed takeover of BSkyB. His recollection of the first meeting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> fairly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> vague&#8221;</span> . That meeting took place five days before the bid was announced. In his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">witness statement, Mr Lamb stated that the proposed takeover had been discussed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref170" href="#footnote170">170</a></sup> In his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">oral evidence he clarified that, on that occasion, what was mentioned was a potential, not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">actual, bid.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref171" href="#footnote171">171</a></sup> Mr Michel was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;certain</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> did</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> discuss</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> BSkyB</span><span style="font-style:italic"> bid</span><span style="font-style:italic"> at</span><span style="font-style:italic"> this</span><span style="font-style:italic"> meeting&#8221;</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because it had not been announced and he would not have mentioned it if he had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aware of an imminent announcement.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref172" href="#footnote172">172</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-7"><a href="#para4-7" name="para4-7">4.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Much more significantly, of the second meeting he stated:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref173" href="#footnote173">173</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;During the second of these meetings &#8211; on 27 October, 2010 &#8211; Mr Michel again raised</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with me the position with regard to the proposed takeover of BSkyB. He argued</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">strongly, on the basis of the legal position, that there were no grounds for a referral.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">During the discussion he raised the issue of News International newspaper coverage</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">given to the Liberal Democrats. He said he felt that the coverage since the election</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had been very fair. He specifically mentioned The Sun and indicated that it had given</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Liberal Democrats reasonable coverage since the general election.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He then implied that if the decision surrounding the bid did not fall in their favour, it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would be a pity if things were to change and they were no longer able to report in such</span>




 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a positive way. I cannot remember the exact phraseology used but the message was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">very clear. I chose not to respond. I took the view that this was part of the lobbying</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">operation in the run up to a decision on the bid.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I was very concerned by what I heard and reported it to Nick Clegg and also to Vince</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">Cable.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We were all very clear that nothing of this sort should influence in any way how the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bid was considered&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added).</span></span>

<p id="para-id-4-8"><a href="#para4-8" name="para4-8">4.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Lamb&#8217;s account of the meeting on 27 October 2010 was corroborated by a manuscript</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">note which he made some time after the event:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> can&#8217;t</span><span style="font-style:italic"> confirm</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> definitely</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the first time on the day on which he gave his oral evidence. It was one of a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">notes which he had made during the early days of the coalition Government &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> ...of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> interesting</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220; Wed 27/10</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">0900 meeting Fred Michel News International. An extraordinary encounter. FM is very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">charming. He tells me News Int. papers will land on VC&#8217;s desk in next 2 weeks. They</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are certain there are no grounds for referral. They realise the political pressures. He</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wants things to run smoothly. They have been supportive of Coalition. But if it goes</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the wrong way he is worried about the implications. It was brazen VC refers case to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Ofcom &#8211; they turn nasty. Then he talked about AV &#8211; how Sun might help the debate &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">use of good graphics to get across case.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">James M has met Nick &#8211; worth working on him to he could be receptive to case. Times</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">will give it fair hearing.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So refer case and implication was clear. News Int turn against Coalition and AV.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-9"><a href="#para4-9" name="para4-9">4.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A further manuscript note evidenced Mr Lamb reporting the conversation to Mr Clegg on 2</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">November 2010. Its representation of Mr Clegg&#8217;s reaction casts an interesting light on political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perceptions of the power and conditionality of press support:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref175" href="#footnote175">175</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...He is horrified by what I tell him of Fred Michel&#8217;s meeting last week re News</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">International.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">- we will lose the only papers who have been positive.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-10"><a href="#para4-10" name="para4-10">4.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel was hoping that he might through Mr Lamb secure a meeting with Dr Cable. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described the meeting as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> friendly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> open&#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref176" href="#footnote176">176</a></sup> and recalled explaining to Mr Lamb the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">growing frustration at News Corp and the sense of unfairness at not being able to make its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case at a meeting. He explained at some length in his third witness statement what was said</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about media coverage, strongly denying that any threat was made, and positing that there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">must have been a misunderstanding:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;...It</span><span style="font-style:italic"> seems</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> me</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Lamb</span><span style="font-style:italic"> has,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> his</span><span style="font-style:italic"> own</span><span style="font-style:italic"> mind,</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">linked various topics of conversation in a way that was certainly never intended by me....&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref177" href="#footnote177">177</a></sup></span>




 <p id="para-id-4-11"><a href="#para4-11" name="para4-11">4.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Deputy Prime Minister recalled that Mr Lamb had spoken to him, stating:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref178" href="#footnote178">178</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;At one point, I was &#8211; it was brought to my attention by Norman Lamb, a friend and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">colleague of mine, a Liberal Democrat MP, that he had been &#8211; the way he described it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at least &#8211; told that it would be good for the Liberal Democrats to be open to the bid,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">otherwise we would expect unfavourable treatment from the Murdoch press, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Norman was quite agitated about that.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I have to say, since we hadn&#8217;t received particularly favourable treatment in the first</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">place, I didn&#8217;t think it was a hugely credible threat, and anyway it was part of so</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">many rumours and counter-rumours and claims and counterclaims that I just said</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to him, &#8220;Look, we just must not be knocked off-course from allowing this process to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proceed in an independent, objective and quasi-judicial manner.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">And throughout all of this, I was very conscious that if I had any role at all, it was just</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to make sure that Vince Cable, as the relevant Secretary of State, was given the kind</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of time and the space to discharge his quasi-judicial functions and was insulated from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">political influence one way or the other.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-12"><a href="#para4-12" name="para4-12">4.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clegg did not recollect Dr Cable speaking to him about veiled threats or bullying from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News Corp or NI.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref179" href="#footnote179">179</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-13"><a href="#para4-13" name="para4-13">4.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am in no doubt that Mr Lamb took what Mr Michel said on 27 October 2010 about media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">coverage to be an implied threat and, given the impact that it had on him, whatever Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Michel said could legitimately have been understood as such a threat. That explains why</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he reported it as such to both Mr Clegg and Dr Cable. However, I am prepared to accept Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Michel&#8217;s evidence that, however it might have appeared and however clumsily he might have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">spoken, he was not, in fact, intending to threaten Mr Lamb or the Liberal Democrats. His</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">modus operandi, which is very well evidenced in the voluminous emails and texts messages</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which he sent, as well as the evidence of others who dealt with him, tends to support his</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">denial.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-14"><a href="#para4-14" name="para4-14">4.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel went about his work in a different way. He mounted charm offensives, flattered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and sought to persuade others of the merits of his employer&#8217;s bid. In his internal emails, there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is no mention or hint that he was looking for other ways to pressurise or persuade, let alone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deploy a threat. Further, his later strategy, so far as the bid is concerned, is recorded in his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">internal emails to colleagues, already discussed, and did not involve threatening the Liberal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Democrats. Rather, he wanted News Corp to curry favour with Dr Cable by supporting him</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the Liberal Democrats generally. His surprise at the interpretation put upon his words</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by Mr Lamb was genuine. I am reinforced in my conclusion by Mr Clegg&#8217;s reaction that it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hugely</span><span style="font-style:italic"> credible</span><span style="font-style:italic"> threat</span> &#8221; and the absence of evidence that the Liberal Democrats</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were in fact &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> done</span><span style="font-style:italic"> over</span> &#8221; by News International&#8217;s titles as a result of Dr Cable&#8217;s decision to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">intervene. It was not suggested that they were.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-15"><a href="#para4-15" name="para4-15">4.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That the bid was discussed in politicised terms between Mr Michel and Liberal Democrat</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MPs is plain and is evidenced not only by Dr Cable&#8217;s recollection but also by Mr Michel&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">own reports of his lobbying efforts.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref180" href="#footnote180">180</a></sup> Whether politicised discussion was in fact the result of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a deliberate effort to politicise the decision by Mr Michel and News Corp is not at all clear.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News Corp believed, on credible grounds, that it had a strong position on both competition</span>



 <span style="font-size: 15px;">and plurality grounds. James Murdoch explained that the timing of the bid was deliberately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">chosen, inter alia, to avoid the issue becoming a political football before the election.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref181" href="#footnote181">181</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-16"><a href="#para4-16" name="para4-16">4.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is impossible to say, without further and disproportionate investigation, whether it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">LiberalDemocratpoliticians,MrMichel,oramixturewhichledtothepoliticised conversations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which took place. Still less is it possible to say whether that politicisation was a deliberate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strategy or simply a failure to focus on the quasi-judicial nature of the decision and the strict</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legal test which had to be applied. What can be said with confidence though is that Dr Cable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">believed that pressure was being exerted by those whom he described as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> News</span><span style="font-style:italic"> International</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">representatives<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;</span><span style="font-style:normal"> (although</span><span style="font-style:normal"> actually</span><span style="font-style:normal"> representatives</span><span style="font-style:normal"> from</span><span style="font-style:normal"> News</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Corp).</span></span>

<p id="para-id-4-17"><a href="#para4-17" name="para4-17">4.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The significance of the context in which the comments were made is that they consequently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fall to be understood as Dr Cable&#8217;s unguarded and emotional reaction to his role in the bid. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his own words he<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;offloaded</span><span style="font-style:italic"> his</span><span style="font-style:italic"> feelings&#8221;</span> . That Dr Cable&#8217;s words were of this nature is further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made clear because he was not technically correct when he said that he had blocked the bid.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Formally, he had only issued an intervention notice.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-18"><a href="#para4-18" name="para4-18">4.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Context may explain Dr Cable&#8217;s comments, but, given his responsibilities, it does not excuse</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them. He did not pretend otherwise, either at the time or to the Inquiry, recognising that his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">words had given rise to an appearance of bias. He told the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref182" href="#footnote182">182</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;No, I do understand in my case that the remarks I made did create a perception</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of bias and therefore made it difficult for me to continue. I fully understand that. It</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">doesn&#8217;t mean to say I would have been biased; I wouldn&#8217;t have been. But nonetheless</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there was a perception issue and that had to be taken into account by the Prime</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Minister&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-19"><a href="#para4-19" name="para4-19">4.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Cable also rightly recognised that the transfer of responsibility for the bid was the inevitable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">result of his own words:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref183" href="#footnote183">183</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. ...Do you have any observations to make on the, as it were, transfer of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">responsibilities to another department or not?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Well, I was angry with myself at what had happened, but given what you just said</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about perception of bias, I understood that there was no alternative in this case.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-20"><a href="#para4-20" name="para4-20">4.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">His remarks, once published, made the perception or appearance of bias inevitable, as in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">due course was therefore the removal of his responsibilities. It is, however, important to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">underline that if what he said had not been recorded by a journalist but had, in fact, been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">heard by a constituent (as he believed was the case), it is certainly possible that what he said</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">could have returned to impact on the bid after he had decided it: his constituent might then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have gone to the press. This only serves to underline the very difficult position faced by those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">charged with making judicial or quasi-judicial decisions.</span>



 <h3>The story breaks</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-21"><a href="#para4-21" name="para4-21">4.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Daily Telegraph published a story about their reporters&#8217; conversation with Dr Cable online</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on 20 December 2010<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref184" href="#footnote184">184</a></sup> and there was further coverage both online and on paper on 21</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">December 2010. Surprisingly, the initial coverage on 20 December 2010 and the morning of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">21 December 2010 did not refer to Dr Cable&#8217;s comments about the bid. There was suspicion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the Daily Telegraph did not want to cause trouble for a Secretary of State who had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made a decision to intervene which was, of course, in the interests of the Telegraph Media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Group (TMG). There can be little doubt that the TMG was not supportive of the bid and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that its opposition was based upon commercial grounds. Aidan Barclay, Chairman of TMG,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subsequently wrote to James Murdoch in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref185" href="#footnote185">185</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I am sure you are aware that the Telegraph was not supportive of the News Corp</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proposed takeover of BSkyB. We took this position as a result of what we believed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were and are genuine commercial concerns...&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-4-22"><a href="#para4-22" name="para4-22">4.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, the Daily Telegraph denied that it was trying to hide the information and maintained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it deliberately held back parts of the transcript of the conversation in order that it could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publish a further instalment and thereby get the maximum return on the story. Whatever</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the motive, the information did not stay out of the public domain for long. A whistleblower</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">passed a full copy of the transcript to the BBC&#8217;s Robert Peston who, at 2:30 pm, published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the passages which had been excised by the Daily Telegraph on his blog; subsequently, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Daily Telegraph did publish them.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref186" href="#footnote186">186</a></sup> As for the motive in withholding what would have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the most explosive part of the story, on the basis that this sub-issue was not fully explored</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and is not essential to the narrative, I make no finding, save only to observe that if that had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been the plan, the whistleblower (who obviously had access to the full details of the story)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apparently did not know about it .</span>

<p id="para-id-4-23"><a href="#para4-23" name="para4-23">4.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Before continuing with the events of 21 December 2010, it is appropriate to record that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">use of subterfuge by the Daily Telegraph directed to Dr Cable was not an isolated incident.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It was one of a number of instances in which undercover Daily Telegraph reporters sought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to elicit unguarded comments from Liberal Democrat MPs. The results were the subject of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">articles on 21, 22 and 23 December 2010 and provoked a complaint to the PCC from Tim</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Farron MP, President of the Liberal Democrats. The complaint was upheld, albeit with an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important qualification concerning Dr Cable:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref187" href="#footnote187">187</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;For the Commission to have sanctioned this method, it would have had to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">convinced that a high level of public interest could reasonably have been postulated</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in advance. It did not believe that the Telegraph &#8211; although acting no doubt with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">legitimate intent &#8211; had sufficient grounds, on a prima facie basis, to justify their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decision to send the reporters in. The complaint was therefore upheld.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Commission did feel that the newspaper had uncovered material in the public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interest regarding the remarks made by Vince Cable about the News Corporation bid</span>




 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for BSkyB, which had led to him being divested of his role in that decision. However,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there had been no suggestion that the intention of the newspaper had been to explore</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">how he had been handling the bid (it made clear in its coverage that Mr Cable [sic]</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had spoken &#8220;despite not being asked about the issue&#8221;), and the newspaper itself had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">chosen not to make it a focus of its first day&#8217;s coverage. The test for the Commission</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was whether there were grounds in the first place to justify the subterfuge: the Cable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">disclosures about Sky were not relevant to that.&#8221;</span>

<h3>The response to the story</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-24"><a href="#para4-24" name="para4-24">4.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">21 December 2010 had already been an important day for consideration of the bid. At midday,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the European Commission unconditionally approved the bid from the European Union</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">competition perspective.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref188" href="#footnote188">188</a></sup> That news prompted communication between James Murdoch</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Mr Hunt. The former tried to call the latter who texted at 12:46hrs:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref189" href="#footnote189">189</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Sorry to miss ur call. Am on my mobile now. Jeremy.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-25"><a href="#para4-25" name="para4-25">4.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">James Murdoch replied at 12:52hrs:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref190" href="#footnote190">190</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Have to run into next thing. Are you free anything after 2.15? I can shuffle after this&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-26"><a href="#para4-26" name="para4-26">4.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A further exchange of texts concluding at 12:56hrs agreed 16:00hrs as a convenient time to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">speak.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref191" href="#footnote191">191</a></sup> At 12:57hrs, Mr Hunt texted again, by this time he had self evidently heard about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the European Commission&#8217;s decision:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref192" href="#footnote192">192</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Great and congrats on Brussels, just Ofcom to go!&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-27"><a href="#para4-27" name="para4-27">4.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The terms of his message were not impartial and are consistent with his broad sympathy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the bid which he had never hidden. It is a matter of importance, however, that the text</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">message was sent before Mr Peston&#8217;s story had been posted and whilst responsibility for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bid still rested with Dr Cable.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-28"><a href="#para4-28" name="para4-28">4.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News of Mr Peston&#8217;s story travelled fast. At 15:50hrs, Sue Beeby, the second of Mr Hunt&#8217;s two</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">SpAds, emailed details of Dr Cable&#8217;s comments to Mr Hunt.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref193" href="#footnote193">193</a></sup> Ten minutes later, at 16:00hrs,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt and James Murdoch spoke by telephone, as previously arranged. James Murdoch</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was described as being &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> totally</span><span style="font-style:italic"> horrified&#8221;</span> by the Secretary of State&#8217;s comments.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref194" href="#footnote194">194</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-29"><a href="#para4-29" name="para4-29">4.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt sought to consult a senior Cabinet colleague, Mr Osborne, texting at 16:08hrs:</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">with No 10 at that stage.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref199" href="#footnote199">199</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-31"><a href="#para4-31" name="para4-31">4.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By the time that Mr Osborne received Mr Hunt&#8217;s two text messages he was already in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">16:00hrs meeting with Mr Cameron and others discussing what was to be done about Dr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cable&#8217;s comments.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref200" href="#footnote200">200</a></sup> He probably did not see the text messages until after the meeting.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref201" href="#footnote201">201</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The meeting itself had originally been a routine meeting to review the day&#8217;s events and to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">look ahead but, in the result, it was used to react to news of Dr Cable&#8217;s comments:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref202" href="#footnote202">202</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...Every day, at 4 o&#8217;clock, there is a Prime Ministerial meeting to review what&#8217;s going</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on that day and look ahead, and I attend that meeting when I&#8217;m in London and my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">diary allows me to do so. So I was going over to Downing Street anyway. The meeting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had, in effect, been cancelled and the meeting had become a discussion of what to do</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about Dr Cable&#8217;s remarks, and I was part of that discussion, with the Prime Minister,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">his most senior civil servant and his political advisers...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-32"><a href="#para4-32" name="para4-32">4.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron highlighted the gravity and urgency of the situation before explaining the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thinking which pointed towards transferring responsibility for the bid to the Secretary of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">State for Culture, Media and Sport:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref203" href="#footnote203">203</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...Such a situation had the potential to damage the Government&#8217;s credibility and it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was important to act quickly to address the issue. I had rapid discussions with my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">senior advisers, including the Permanent Secretary, as to the best way forward, as it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was clear that Vince Cable could no longer continue in the decision-making role given</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the nature of the his comments.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I consider a range of options for how to handle this matter. I did not want to dismiss</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Vince Cable from his position as, while he had behaved inappropriately by speaking</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as he had on this particular issue, he dealt with many other issues effectively</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as Secretary of State and was providing a valuable contribution to the Coalition</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Government. Jeremy Heywood, the Permanent Secretary at Number 10, suggested</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the option of transferring responsibility for media competition issues, including the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">option of transferring responsibility for media regulation. It seemed to me that this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was the most logical, straightforward and effective option and it made sense for the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">policy issues of media competition and media regulation to be the responsibility of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">one department.&#8221;</span>









 <p id="para-id-4-33"><a href="#para4-33" name="para4-33">4.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Osborne graphically described the political pressures that had been unleashed by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication of Dr Cable&#8217;s unedited remarks in Mr Peston&#8217;s blog only 90 minutes earlier:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref204" href="#footnote204">204</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think that &#8211; on the day, I remember the pressure was enormous to do something</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about the political crisis that had been unleashed on the government out of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">blue at 3 o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. Obviously, we had no idea that Dr Cable had said</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">these things. They weren&#8217;t in the Telegraph&#8217;s report of the story that morning, which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had itself caused some problems, and we had to deal with &#8211; I mean, the pressure</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in government, in modern government, is to &#8211; is you have to make sure you have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">answers to some the [sic] tough questions that the media are throwing at you, even if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it comes in the middle of the afternoon, just as you&#8217;re doing other things.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-34"><a href="#para4-34" name="para4-34">4.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Osborne recalled that the original suggestion to transfer responsibility for the bid to Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Hunt came not from a politician but from (now Sir) Jeremy Heywood, then the Downing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Street Permanent Secretary. He too emphasised a desire not to remove Dr Cable from his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">post altogether, expressing on his part concern about the impact that such a step might have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had on the coalition:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref205" href="#footnote205">205</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The principal concern in the meeting &#8211; and certainly my principal concern, what I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was seeking to say in the meeting &#8211; was that this was not something which should</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">lead to the resignation of Dr Cable. I thought what Dr Cable had said was wrong but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I didn&#8217;t think it merited his resignation, and frankly I also had concerns about the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">impact of such a resignation on the Coalition and the unity of the government.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So I was looking for a solution, as indeed were other people in the room, that did</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not involve someone else becoming the Secretary of State for Business and Dr Cable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">leaving the government or indeed Dr Cable moving to another portfolio, because</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that would trigger a wider Cabinet reshuffle which was not something we felt, just</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">before Christmas, with, as I say, the Coalition in its first year, something we wanted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to see, and indeed we thought Dr Cable was doing a good job as business secretary,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other than on this particular issue of what he&#8217;d said about the Murdochs. So we were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">looking for solutions that did not involve Dr Cable resigning or moving from business</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">secretary, and Jeremy Heywood suggested the solution of moving the responsibility</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for media plurality to the department for culture, media and sport. So it was, in a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">way, a structural solution within Whitehall to the problem, and my recollection is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">once Mr Heywood had proposed that, we thought that was a good solution and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would help keep Dr Cable in government whilst removing from him the responsibility</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for media plurality, and it, I think, also struck us all as rather commonsensical that it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would move to the department that was, after all, called the department for media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and already had responsibilities for media regulation.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-35"><a href="#para4-35" name="para4-35">4.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By around 16:30hrs telephone advice was being sought from the Treasury Solicitor, (now</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir) Paul Jenkins about the issue. Sir Paul, who was at home on leave, spoke to a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">officials, including the Cabinet Secretary, Lord O&#8217;Donnell, during the course of the next hour.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He confirmed, from a legal perspective, the prevailing view that Dr Cable could not properly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">retain responsibility for the bid, and went further by advising against delegating the decision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to a junior minister at BIS:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref206" href="#footnote206">206</a></sup></span>



 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...I confirmed to Sir Gus that it was my opinion that Dr Cable could no longer properly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">discharge his functions under the Enterprise Act 2000 in relation to the BSkyB bid</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">because, whilst seized of the matter, he had made statements of a kind that tainted,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">irrevocably, his ability to discharge his functions in a quasi-judicial manner...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">...I also advised Sir Gus that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the option of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">delegating the decision-making responsibility to a junior Minister in the Department</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for Business, Innovation and Skills would give rise to significant legal risks and this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">option was not pursued.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-36"><a href="#para4-36" name="para4-36">4.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Paul regarded the emerging alternative candidate for the decision, Mr Hunt, as the obvious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">choice:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref207" href="#footnote207">207</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In these circumstances the obvious alternative was for the functions to be transferred</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to another Secretary of State; and the obvious Secretary of State was the Secretary of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">State for Culture, Media and Sport. I was aware from the discussions that the Prime</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Minister was considering this as the natural option&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-37"><a href="#para4-37" name="para4-37">4.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was an awareness of the need to check whether responsibility for the bid could properly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be transferred to Mr Hunt. Accordingly, Sir Jeremy contacted the Permanent Secretary at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCMS, Jonathan Stephens. Like Sir Paul, Mr Stephens was also at home, starting his Christmas</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">leave. Mr Stephens recalled being asked whether Mr Hunt had publicly made any comment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which might appear to have pre-judged the issue. He was only aware of what his Secretary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of State had said on 15 June 2010, the day on which the bid was announced. He caused</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">checks to be made by his officials and with Mr Hunt&#8217;s SpAds before passing on Mr Hunt&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public comments to Sir Jeremy, whom he knew to be consulting lawyers and the Cabinet</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Secretary.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref208" href="#footnote208">208</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-38"><a href="#para4-38" name="para4-38">4.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Witnesses were understandably unable to recollect the precise terms in which Mr Hunt&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant public statements were communicated to the Treasury Solicitor, who was asked to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advise. For his part, Sir Paul put it this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref209" href="#footnote209">209</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I was provided with the gist of the comments made by Jeremy Hunt by Sir Gus over</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the telephone. I have now seen the comments attributed to Jeremy Hunt collected at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">paragraph 172 of the Prime Minister&#8217;s statement. I believe that the gist as relayed to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">me fairly summarised the content of those comments&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-39"><a href="#para4-39" name="para4-39">4.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The comments to which Sir Paul was referring to in the quotation above, as set out in Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cameron&#8217;s witness statement, are these:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref210" href="#footnote210">210</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;a. An interview in the Financial Times, published on 16 June 2010, where he was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">quoted as saying:</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It does seem to me that News Corp do control Sky already, so it isn&#8217;t clear to me that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in terms of media plurality there is a substantive change, but I don&#8217;t want to second</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">guess what regulators might decide.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">b. An interview in Broadcast magazine where he was also quoted as saying:</span>




 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Rather than worrying about Rupert Murdoch owning another TV channel, what we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should recognise is that he has probably done more to create variety and choice in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">British TV than any other single person.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">c. The description of Jeremy Hunt in the same Broadcast magazine article, which was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">displayed on his constituency website, as:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">like all good Conservatives Hunt is a cheerleader for Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s contribution to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the health of British television.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-40"><a href="#para4-40" name="para4-40">4.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Paul did not consider that these matters precluded Mr Hunt from taking over Dr Cable&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision making function in relation to the bid and advised the Cabinet Secretary accordingly.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">His reasons were recorded in a note produced by Lord O&#8217;Donnell for Mr Cameron the next</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">day. In his evidence Sir Paul explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref211" href="#footnote211">211</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...I took the view that senior politicians in the office of Secretary of State should</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be credited with the ability to put aside such personal views, expressed before their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">holding of a decision-making power, so that they can approach the decision-making</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">process, on advice and with a fresh mind. I did not think that Jeremy Hunt&#8217;s comments</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were of a nature that indicated that they could not be put aside; nor that a reasonable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and informed person would conclude that they could not be put aside. I acknowledge</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that there will be occasions when a politician does make such a comment but I do not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think this was one&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-41"><a href="#para4-41" name="para4-41">4.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Paul&#8217;s advice was accepted and cemented the provisional decision to transfer Dr Cable&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">functions in relation to the bid from BIS to DCMS and Mr Hunt.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-42"><a href="#para4-42" name="para4-42">4.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Meanwhile, at 16:58hrs, after the meeting in Downing Street, but whilst legal advice was still</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being taken, Mr Osborne replied to Mr Hunt&#8217;s earlier text messages by referring to the then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">still provisional decision to transfer responsibility for the bid to Mr Hunt: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hope</span><span style="font-style:italic"> you</span><span style="font-style:italic"> like</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">solution!&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref212" href="#footnote212">212</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-43"><a href="#para4-43" name="para4-43">4.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By the time he received Mr Osborne&#8217;s text, Mr Hunt knew something of what was happening</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, in particular, that Downing Street was checking whether public comments sympathetic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the bid were an obstacle to his assuming responsibility for the bid.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref213" href="#footnote213">213</a></sup> Not only were these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">comments being considered by the Cabinet Secretary and Treasury Solicitor, they were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also scrutinised by the Legal Director at DCMS, Patrick Kilgarriff. Mr Kilgarriff&#8217;s views on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">comments about the bid made by the Secretary of State on 15 June 2010 were recorded in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an internal email which Mr Hunt forwarded to Ed Llewellyn, the Downing Street Chief of Staff</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at 17:30hrs.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-44"><a href="#para4-44" name="para4-44">4.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is clear from the terms in which Mr Kilgarriff couched his email that whilst he did not think</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt&#8217;s comments precluded him from making a decision about the bid, he did foresee</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that they might prove to be controversial and the subject of challenge. Consequently, he was</span>



 <span style="font-size: 15px;">alive to the fact that a carefully reasoned decision, based on the all the relevant evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was going to be needed. He rightly foresaw the need for particular care. He put it this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref214" href="#footnote214">214</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;When did JH say it? I assume it was shortly after News Int announced its intention</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to buy out the other shareholders in Sky. Therefore at a time when JH was not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">responsible for policy in this area. If so, it is not helpful and tends towards an element</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of pre-judging the issue. That said, the view is far from definitive as is demonstrated</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by the wish not to second guess decision making by regulator and &#8220;it isn&#8217;t clear to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">me&#8221; so unhelpful and enough to draw comment and perhaps challenge but probably</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not fatal when a well reasoned decision is made with conclusions based on all the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relevant evidence&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added).</span></span>

<p id="para-id-4-45"><a href="#para4-45" name="para4-45">4.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It was common ground that the only comments sought and then put to the Treasury Solicitor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for consideration and advice were public comments made by Mr Hunt. Sir Paul was not aware,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when he advised, that in fact Mr Hunt had sent a memorandum detailing his views about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the bid to the Prime Minister&#8217;s office on 19 November 2010 and another earlier memo had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">touched upon the subject on 18 June 2010. Nor was Sir Paul aware that Mr Hunt had spoken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to James Murdoch on 21 December 2010 and had, only hours before responsibility for the bid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been transferred to him, congratulated James Murdoch by text on the bid&#8217;s clearance by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the European competition authorities.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-46"><a href="#para4-46" name="para4-46">4.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both of the memoranda were updates of a sort which had been encouraged by Mr Cameron</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from all of his Front Bench since his days in Opposition.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref215" href="#footnote215">215</a></sup> Reference to the bid in the June</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2011 memorandum was of a passing nature but had prophetically recognised the bid as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political elephant trap:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref216" href="#footnote216">216</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I have met or spoken to most of the big media owners &#8211; Michael Lyons / Mark</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Thompson, [sic] James Murdoch, Archie Norman / Adam Crozier. Following a steer by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Nick Clegg, I am sending signals publicly and privately that our rhetoric will be more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">generous to the BBC than it was in opposition. But the issues that matter to our own</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">supporters &#8211; BBC salaries and profligate use of licence fee money &#8211; will be sortable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">when we have the licence fee negotiations next year. I steered clear of commenting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on News Corp&#8217;s plans to buy out the 61% of Sky they do not own on the grounds it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was a competition issue for regulators and not for ministers &#8211; but there are likely to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be further elephant traps in the media landscape which we must be careful to avoid.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(emphasis added)</span>

<p id="para-id-4-47"><a href="#para4-47" name="para4-47">4.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second note leaves Mr Hunt&#8217;s sympathetic views about the bid, and the reasons for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them, in no doubt. Crucially, there was nevertheless a very clear recognition that approving</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the bid was not a Government issue, that the decision had to be kept at arm&#8217;s length, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that any meeting with Dr Cable had to be confined to policy issues and not to the decision on</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the bid:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref217" href="#footnote217">217</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A lot has been happening in my sectors so here goes with a brief update:</span>




 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">NewsCorp/Sky bid James Murdoch is pretty furious at Vince&#8217;s referral of Ofcom. He</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">doesn&#8217;t think he will get a fair hearing from Ofcom. I am privately concerned about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this because NewsCorp are very litigious and we could end up in the wrong place in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">terms of media policy. Essentially what James Murdoch wants to do is repeat what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">his father did with the move to Wapping and create the world&#8217;s first multi-platform</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">media operator, available from paper to web to TV to iPhone to iPad. Isn&#8217;t this what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">all media companies have to do ultimately? And if so, we must be very careful that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any attempt to block it is done on plurality grounds and not as a result of lobbying by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">competitors.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The UK has the chance to lead the way on this as we did in 80s [sic] with the Wapping</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">move but if we block it our media sector will suffer for years. In the end I am sure</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sensible controls can be put into any merger to ensure there is plurality, but I think it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would be totally wrong to cave in to the Mark Thompson [sic] / Channel 4 / Guardian</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">line that this represents a substantial change of control given that we all know Sky is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">controlled by NewsCorp now anyway.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">What next? Ofcom will issue their report saying whether it needs to go to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Competition Commission by 31 December. It would totally wrong [sic] for the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">government to get involved in a competition issue which has to be decided at arms</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">length. However I do think you, I, Vince and the DPM should meet to discuss the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">policy issues that are thrown up as a result.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-4-48"><a href="#para4-48" name="para4-48">4.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not perhaps surprising that Mr Cameron did not remember the existence of the note</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when he was considering how to react to publication of Dr Cable&#8217;s comments on 21 December</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010, more than a month later. Had he done so, I have no doubt that he would have asked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for it to be considered by the Treasury Solicitor along with Mr Hunt&#8217;s public comments about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the bid:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref218" href="#footnote218">218</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The issue here is I don&#8217;t particularly remember this note, and crucially, I didn&#8217;t recall</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">its existence on the day of 21 December when we were making this decision, and I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">say that frankly. Obviously if I had recalled it, I would have fed it into the system, as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it were, but as I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll come to, it&#8217;s pretty clear from the legal advice we have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that that wouldn&#8217;t have actually made any difference to the outcome.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-49"><a href="#para4-49" name="para4-49">4.49</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron&#8217;s retrospective conclusion was, in fact, borne out by the Treasury Solicitor. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statement made by Sir Paul to the Inquiry was, indeed, that if had he known about the 19</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">November 2010 memorandum, it would have made no difference to his advice:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref219" href="#footnote219">219</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I am quite clear that my advice to Sir Gus would not have been any different had I</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">seen the note at the time. Jeremy Hunt appears to have been providing his personal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">opinion to the Prime Minister at a time when he had no decision-making powers in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">respect of the bid. Just as in his public statements he offers personal views on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">plurality issues. Just as in his public statements he also acknowledges that these are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in effect regulatory issues to be taken quasi-judicially. I thus do not think there is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">anything in the note to indicate that Jeremy Hunt could not have properly set aside</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">his personal views and considered the bid on the basis of the evidence, advice and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expert opinion before him once he had inherited the relevant powers.&#8221;</span>


 <p id="para-id-4-50"><a href="#para4-50" name="para4-50">4.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is noteworthy that Mr Hunt&#8217;s suggestion that there should be a meeting between Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cameron, Mr Clegg, himself and Dr Cable to discuss policy issues thrown up as a result of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bid was not acted upon, as Mr Cameron was able to confirm:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref220" href="#footnote220">220</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I do not recall responding to Jeremy Hunt&#8217;s note either in writing or by speaking to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">him about it. The meeting he suggested take place did not happen and I do not recall</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any arrangement being made for it to happen...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-51"><a href="#para4-51" name="para4-51">4.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Turning to Mr Hunt, he acknowledges that he did not volunteer the fact that he had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in contact with James Murdoch on 21 December 2010 and had congratulated him on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">European Commission&#8217;s decision by text, nor did he raise the existence of his 19 November</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010 memorandum. Put shortly, he did not think that they demonstrated any view</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantively different to that which he had publicly expressed:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref221" href="#footnote221">221</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220; Q. Were you asked, though, about anything which was not in the public domain,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but which might embarrass you should it enter the public domain?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A. No.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Do you feel that such matters should have been volunteered by you?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Are you talking about my memo to the Prime Minister?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Well, the memo to the Prime Minister, the conversation with Mr Murdoch and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">text message we&#8217;ve looked at about the congratulations for Brussels, just Ofcom to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">go. It&#8217;s the accumulation of pieces of evidence. It&#8217;s that material, Mr Hunt, basically.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I think that all that material is entirely consistent with the overall position that I&#8217;d</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">taken that I was sympathetic to the bid and I didn&#8217;t think there was a media plurality</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">issue, I didn&#8217;t think we should second-guess the regulators and I thought that due</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">process should be followed.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Isn&#8217;t there a difference, though, between what was stated publicly at interview</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with the Financial Times and the sort of material we&#8217;ve been looking at? Do you see</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there as being possibly any difference?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a substantive difference because substantively my position in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">all those communications is the same: I, broadly speaking, had the view that BSkyB</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was already controlled by the Murdochs so I didn&#8217;t think there was a change in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">plurality, but I believed that due process had to be respected, so I do not think there&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a particular difference.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-52"><a href="#para4-52" name="para4-52">4.52</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not in the least surprising that the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an opinion upon a major media issue, in this case the bid by News Corp, or that he should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have contact with a major player in his sector of responsibility, such as James Murdoch: on</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the contrary, it would have been more surprising had he not had a view or, indeed, contact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Mr Murdoch. Moreover, what Mr Hunt was saying in private to Mr Murdoch and writing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Prime Minister was not inconsistent with what he was putting into the public domain.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He did, though, go into more detail, his comments were much nearer in time to the transfer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to him of responsibility for the bid and he was more emphatic in his support for the bid in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private. The mere fact of his private statements increased the quantity (and quality) of what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he had said and written on the subject.</span>


 <p id="para-id-4-53"><a href="#para4-53" name="para4-53">4.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In relation to a decision which was as politically charged as this one, and a decision about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">handling of a process which was quasi-judicial and therefore legally challengeable on grounds</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of appearance of bias, it would have been prudent for Mr Hunt to have reminded those at No</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">10 of the fact of his 19 November 2010 note and to have volunteered the extent of his private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contact with James Murdoch. The additional information, provided openly and transparently,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could then have been taken into account and fully informed advice given.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-54"><a href="#para4-54" name="para4-54">4.54</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not necessary for me to decide whether or not knowledge of Mr Hunt&#8217;s contact with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">James Murdoch would have made any difference to the advice given by the Treasury Solicitor.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He has confirmed that knowledge of the note would not have made a difference and the way</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in which he explained his view makes it is reasonable to infer that he would have maintained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that position had he also known about the private contact with James Murdoch. I accept,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">however, that this is entirely speculative and to have pressed Sir Paul to speculate further as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to what his advice might have been ex post facto would have been unfair. More important, for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the purposes of the Inquiry, it is entirely unnecessary because whatever the answer, the wider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">point for the future conduct of politicians (and especially those in power) remains the same.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ministers must be especially vigilant in matters relating to media policy, especially quasi-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">judicial decisions, and indeed to any circumstance in which they are called upon to exercise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discretion which might impact on those with whom they have or have had a relationship,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether working or personal. In short, they must put themselves above suspicion.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-55"><a href="#para4-55" name="para4-55">4.55</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The decision which Mr Cameron made, subject to legal advice, and its timing were entirely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understandable. There were enormous pressures on the Government to act quickly. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media storm would only have gathered strength if decisive action had not been taken. News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Corp were understandably deeply concerned by Dr Cable&#8217;s words and a solution which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">restored confidence in the decision making process was urgently required. There were sound</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasons not to remove Dr Cable from office, articulated by Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport was the obvious candidate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to entrust with the decision because of his portfolio. Finding a suitable decision maker who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not have a prior view one way or another about the bid would most likely have proved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be a wild goose chase. Almost every leading politician has a view, one way or the other,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s companies and it is often strongly held.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref222" href="#footnote222">222</a></sup> The evidence does not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">begin to support a conclusion that the choice of Mr Hunt was the product of improper media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressure, still less an attempt to guarantee a particular outcome to the process, a subject to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which this Report returns following consideration of Mr Hunt&#8217;s handling of the bid.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-56"><a href="#para4-56" name="para4-56">4.56</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The question of Mr Hunt&#8217;s disclosures at this point does, however, raise one further point</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of interest. Had he disclosed the full extent of his relevant interactions at the outset, an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opportunity would have arisen for those responsible for doing so to offer him more specific</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">advice on the conduct of the bid process and on managing the risks of appearance of bias,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">tailored to the specifics of the circumstances. That might have made a difference, but I say</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no more than that.</span>

<h2>5.  December 2010 &#8211; July 2011: The Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport</h2>


<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The delicacy of the task for which Mr Hunt assumed responsibility should not be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">underestimated. From a political perspective the decision was inherently controversial, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hot</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">potato&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> as</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Prime</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Minister</span><span style="font-style:normal"> put</span><span style="font-style:normal"> it.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref223" href="#footnote223">223</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> From</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span><span style="font-style:normal"> procedural</span><span style="font-style:normal"> point</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> view,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Dr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Cable&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:normal"> apparent</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bias had caused News Corp considerable concern about, and lack of faith in, the process up</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to this point, as is plain to see from its solicitors&#8217; subsequent correspondence.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref224" href="#footnote224">224</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt&#8217;s own comments about the bid, whilst not enough to prevent him from taking on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the task, were such as to generate unease on the part of opponents to the bid. Consequently,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as both Mr Kilgarriff and Mr Stephens had astutely recognised, there was a need to take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular care going forward.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref225" href="#footnote225">225</a></sup> Mr Hunt had to be scrupulously fair to both sides and had to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be seen to be so. He was walking a tightrope.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-3"><a href="#para5-3" name="para5-3">5.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This Report first considers the formal handling of the bid by Mr Hunt and DCMS before</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">separately considering the lobbying which was happening concurrently behind the scenes and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the various unsolicited submissions and representations which were made to the Secretary</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">of State.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-4"><a href="#para5-4" name="para5-4">5.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The handover of responsibility was executed promptly. It involved the transfer of 70 or so</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">staff from BIS to DCMS and a high level meeting on the morning of 22 December 2010.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref226" href="#footnote226">226</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Stephens described these immediate steps, identified the main DCMS attendees at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meeting, and emphasised that the requirements of a quasi-judicial process were addressed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the meeting:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref227" href="#footnote227">227</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Given the circumstances surrounding the transfer of responsibility, I was particularly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">conscious of the need to establish robust processes to support the Secretary of State&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">new responsibilities. I also had to oversee the immediate transfer of some 70 or so</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">staff from BIS to DCMS, with their responsibilities and budgets. I identified Jon eff,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">then Director, Media, as the lead policy official and he ensured that the relevant BIS</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">officials and lawyers were present at a meeting the next day (the 22<span style="font-size: 9px;"> nd</span> December)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with the Secretary of State. I also attended that meeting, along with Jon eff, a DCMS</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">lawyer, and Adam Smith...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">At that meeting BIS officials briefed the Secretary of State on his functions and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">responsibilities, the decision already taken and the next steps. In particular they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reinforced the advice in the Department&#8217;s submission to the Secretary of State of 12<span style="font-size: 9px;"> th</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">November that this was a quasi-judicial process and set out what that required...&#8221;</span>






 <p id="para-id-5-5"><a href="#para5-5" name="para5-5">5.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt was sure that the term quasi judicial was used when his role in the process was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">outlined at the meeting. He had not himself exercised a quasi judicial role before.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref228" href="#footnote228">228</a></sup> But he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was well aware of the sensitivities:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref229" href="#footnote229">229</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: [I]t was abundantly clear to you, wasn&#8217;t it that enormous</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">care had to be exercised? One of the things in the note from BIS was a reference</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the fact that the Secretary of State for BERR &#8211; the decision to intervene in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Lloyds HBOS merger [-] was judicially reviewed on the basis that his discretion had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been fettered by comments by the Chancellor, so great sensitivity around all these</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">decisions?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">A. Absolutely right.&#8221;</span>
<h3>The OFT and Ofcom reports</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-6"><a href="#para5-6" name="para5-6">5.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The OFT reported to Mr Hunt on 30 December 2010, predictably concluding that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposed transaction, if executed, would constitute a European relevant merger situation.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This formally confirmed that the Secretary of State did have jurisdiction to make a reference</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Competition Commission under Article 5(3) of the Enterprise Act (Protection of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Legitimate Interests) Order 2003 (&#8220;the 2003 Order&#8221;) to address any media plurality concerns</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if he believed that the relevant statutory conditions were satisfied.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref230" href="#footnote230">230</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-7"><a href="#para5-7" name="para5-7">5.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The following day, Ofcom delivered its keenly anticipated report on plurality, recommending</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a fuller second stage review by the Competition Commission.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref231" href="#footnote231">231</a></sup> Ofcom put its advice and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusion in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref232" href="#footnote232">232</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Ofcom&#8217;s advice, based on the evidence and reasons set out in this report and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">summarised in the executive summary, is that it may be the case that the proposed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">acquisition may be expected to operate against the public interest since there may</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not be a sufficient plurality of persons with control of media enterprises providing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">news and current affairs to UK-wide cross-media audiences. In reaching this view we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">do not rely on the dynamic effects discussed in full in Section 6.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Therefore we believe there is a need for a fuller second stage review of these issues</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by the Competition Commission to assess the extent to which the concentration in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">media ownership may act against the public interest, and we advise the Secretary of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">State accordingly.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-8"><a href="#para5-8" name="para5-8">5.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom&#8217;s work had drawn into focus a wider issue concerning the adequacy of the regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">framework and in particular the lack of a mechanism with which to address a threat to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">plurality arising from the organic growth of a company. Whilst this lacuna was not immediately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant to the bid, the recommendation is highly relevant to the Terms of Reference and</span>





 <span style="font-size: 15px;">is further analysed below.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref233" href="#footnote233">233</a></sup> For present purposes it is sufficient to note and endorse the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendation which Ofcom made in Chapter 7 of its report:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref234" href="#footnote234">234</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Under the current statutory framework, a media public interest consideration of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">plurality can only be triggered when there is a proposed merger involving media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enterprises. The future market developments considered in this report suggest</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the current statutory framework may no longer be fully equipped to achieve</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Parliament&#8217;s objective of ensuring sufficient plurality of media ownership.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The market developments identified include the risk of market exit by current news</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">providers, or a steady organic growth in audience shares and increase in ability to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">influence by any one provider. For example, in a situation where a company grows</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">organically through entirely legitimate business strategy which does not involve any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">anti-competitive behaviour but finds itself in the relevant media market with 90%</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">share of audiences. While this may not have raised competition concerns, it very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">clearly may raise plurality concerns.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">While there is a clear statutory framework for remedying competition concerns which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">may arise in the context of a merger, the same is not true of concerns related to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">plurality more generally. This means that if a transaction is found not to operate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">against the public interest in relation to plurality at the time, there is no subsequent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">opportunity or mechanism to address or even to consider any plurality concerns</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which develop over time.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We therefore also recommend that the Government consider undertaking a wider</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reviewofthestatutoryframeworktoensurepluralityin thepublicinterest.Specifically,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we believe there may be value in providing for intervention where plurality concerns</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">arise in the absence of a corporate transaction involving media enterprises and which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are not safeguarded by the current media ownership rules.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<h3>Procedural arrangements and meetings with James Murdoch</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-9"><a href="#para5-9" name="para5-9">5.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt&#8217;s formal task, having received the above reports, was to decide whether or not to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">refer the proposed transaction to the Competition Commission. The applicable test was (and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is) that provided by article 5(3) of the 2003 Order which states:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;3) The Secretary of State may make a reference to the Commission if he believes</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that it is or may be the case that &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) arrangements are in progress or in contemplation which, if carried into effect,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">will result in the creation of a European relevant merger situation;</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) one or more than one public interest consideration mentioned in the European</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">intervention notice is relevant to a consideration of the European relevant merger</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">situation concerned; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) taking account only of the relevant public interest consideration or considerations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">concerned, the creation of that situation operates or may be expected to operate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">against the public interest.&#8221;</span>


 <p id="para-id-5-10"><a href="#para5-10" name="para5-10">5.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As is the case at the intervention stage, the test at the referral stage contains a discretion.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The discretion allows a low threshold for intervention. Mr Hunt was bound by article 5(5)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the 2003 Order to accept the decision of the OFT on jurisdiction which, in any event, was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">uncontroversial. That disposed of the consideration under article 5(3)(a) of the test. In effect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it remained for him to decide whether or not to follow Ofcom&#8217;s recommendation to refer the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bid to the Competition Commission in this case.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-11"><a href="#para5-11" name="para5-11">5.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Before addressing the substantive decision, Mr Hunt had first to consider procedure. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular, Allen & Overy, solicitors acting on behalf of News Corp, had lost no time in writing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to him on 23 December 2010, complaining in strong terms about his predecessor&#8217;s handling</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the matter and requesting to know how Mr Hunt intended to proceed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref235" href="#footnote235">235</a></sup> DCMS replied</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">promising a redacted copy of Ofcom&#8217;s report when it was available and assuring News Corp</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it would be given: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> reasonable</span><span style="font-style:italic"> opportunity</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> make</span><span style="font-style:italic"> written</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> oral</span><span style="font-style:italic"> representations</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">before the Secretary of State takes his decision...&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref236" href="#footnote236">236</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-12"><a href="#para5-12" name="para5-12">5.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Allen & Overy wrote again on 5 January 2011 pressing for progress and expressing fears about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">how long the process might take.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref237" href="#footnote237">237</a></sup> By this time The Treasury Solicitor (TSol) was acting for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Secretary of State and replied, explaining that he did not wish to delay the decision,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that Mr Hunt was prepared to meet News Corp.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref238" href="#footnote238">238</a></sup> It is entirely understandable, in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exceptional circumstances that the bid had come to him, that Mr Hunt should have done so.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-13"><a href="#para5-13" name="para5-13">5.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The meeting with News Corp took place on 6 January 2011. Mr Hunt had conferred with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his officials and legal advisers the previous day in preparation, and an aide memoire was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prepared for him.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref239" href="#footnote239">239</a></sup> The Secretary of State was accompanied at the meeting by Mr eff,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Kilgarriff, Adam Smith and his Private Secretary. News Corp was represented by James</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch, Mr Michel and others. A detailed note was taken and it was expressly recorded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that those present would be open about the fact of the meeting:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref240" href="#footnote240">240</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It was agreed that subject [sic] of these discussions would be kept confidential at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this stage but both sides would be open about the fact meetings that [sic] had taken</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">place. It was expected that the OFCOM and any News Corp submissions would be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">released no later than the SoS&#8217; decision on referral.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-14"><a href="#para5-14" name="para5-14">5.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">According to the minute Mr Hunt broke the news at the meeting that he was minded to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">refer the proposed transaction to the Competition Commission, explaining that Ofcom&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendation, together with advice which he had received from counsel, had caused him</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to reach this provisional view. He referred to the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> low</span> &#8221; threshold set by the statutory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">test. A redacted copy of the Ofcom report was to be provided to News Corp the following day</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the company was to have a week to make written submissions, if it so wished, before</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt made a final decision. These submissions were not to be a re-submission of News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Corp&#8217;s evidence to Ofcom. If, as a result of such submissions, or certain clarifications which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt wished to seek from Ofcom, Mr Hunt became minded not to refer the deal then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other interested parties would be given the opportunity to state their cases.</span>






 <p id="para-id-5-15"><a href="#para5-15" name="para5-15">5.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Amongst a number of points, News Corp expressed serious concerns about Ofcom&#8217;s work,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and warned that the practical effect of a referral would be to decrease the likelihood of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sale being completed and reserved its legal rights. Those speaking on behalf of the company</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also made clear its fallback position, which was that a further meeting would be sought if its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">written submissions were not successful, in order to discuss those submissions and potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remedies as necessary. By remedies News Corp was referring to undertakings in lieu of referral</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(&#8220;UIL&#8221;) which the Secretary of State has the power to accept under the Enterprise Act:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref241" href="#footnote241">241</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Secretary of State may, instead of making such a reference and for the purpose</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of remedying, mitigating or preventing any of the effects adverse to the public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interest which have or may have resulted, or which may be expected to result, from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the creation of the European relevant merger situation concerned accept from such of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the parties concerned as she considers appropriate undertakings to take such action</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as he considers appropriate.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-16"><a href="#para5-16" name="para5-16">5.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The terms of the Departmental aide memoire, which are realistic, give an insight in to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the thinking in DCMS; it suggests that Mr Hunt was not going to be easily moved from his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provisional view but that he was open to a further meeting to discuss any written submissions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which News Corp might produce:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref242" href="#footnote242">242</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I have carefully read the Ofcom report and I find it very difficult on the basis of what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I have seen to date to see any grounds which would allow me to not refer this case</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the Competition Commission, especially given that the threshold for referring is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relatively low.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I will consider carefully any arguments you subsequently put to me and would be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">happy to have a further meeting on the substance of the report. But my feeling at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this stage is that that [sic] you will have to identify some very serious flaws in Ofcom&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">facts or analysis before I could consider not referring...&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (original</span><span style="font-style:normal"> underlining)</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Formal &#8220;minded to&#8221; letters were sent by Mr Hunt to both News Corp and BSkyB on 7 January</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2011 enclosing both the OFT report and a redacted version of Ofcom&#8217;s report. The letters</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained that the Secretary of State was minded to refer the matter but, as is required by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Enterprise Act 2002,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref243" href="#footnote243">243</a></sup> consulted the relevant parties likely to be adversely affected by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the decision if it was confirmed. In this case the letters did so by inviting written submissions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and offering a meeting.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref244" href="#footnote244">244</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-18"><a href="#para5-18" name="para5-18">5.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 10 January 2012, Mr Hunt, Mr Smith and officials met Ed Richards, the CEO of Ofcom. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was to seek clarification on various aspects of the Ofcom report.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref245" href="#footnote245">245</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-19"><a href="#para5-19" name="para5-19">5.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 13 January 2011, BSkyB made detailed written submissions to the Secretary of State,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">urging him to reject Ofcom&#8217;s advice and to permit the transaction to complete without a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">referral.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref246" href="#footnote246">246</a></sup> These submissions were followed very shortly afterwards by those of Allen &</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Overy, on behalf of News Corp, which were delivered on 14 January 2011 in both confidential</span>






 <span style="font-size: 15px;">and redacted format. Their very detailed submissions amounted to a sustained full frontal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attack on the Ofcom report, tantamount to an allegation of bias:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref247" href="#footnote247">247</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;News [sic] believes that Ofcom has failed to approach the effects of this Transaction</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with an open mind and has carried out a review process with the intention of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">identifying concerns. Ofcom has been noticeably more receptive to submissions made</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by third party complainants than it has been to submissions made by News and has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">chosen to present the evidence in a one sided way (in some cases selectively omitting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relevant evidence)&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-20"><a href="#para5-20" name="para5-20">5.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Conspicuously, the submissions did not conclude by throwing down the gauntlet to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State, although they were careful to preserve News Corp&#8217;s legal position. Instead</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they culminated by indicating a willingness on the part of News Corp to give UIL which would</span>

<p id="para-id-5-21"><a href="#para5-21" name="para5-21">5.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News Corp&#8217;s proposal was to &#8220;spin off&#8221; Sky News as an independent company so as to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">guarantee its continued editorial independence and to commit to a long term carriage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">agreement so as to ensure the commercial viability of the hived off entity. The arrangements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were summarised by Allen & Overy in a covering letter expressed in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref250" href="#footnote250">250</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The attached UIL proposal involves a commitment from News that Sky News will</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be spun off as an independent UK public limited company (Newco), with its shares</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">publicly traded. Shares in Newco would be distributed to the existing shareholders of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Sky, as far as possible, in the same proportions as their existing shareholding (so that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">News will retain only the same shareholding in Sky News as it currently has in Sky,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">39.1%).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The corporate governance structure of Newco will also replicate the effect of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">existing governance structure of Sky, which has been in place for a number of years.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">In particular, after closing:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) The voting agreement dated 21 September 2005 between the Sky [sic] and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">News which prevents News from exercising more than 37.19% of the votes will</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be replicated in respect of Newco;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) a majority of the board of Newco shall comprise non-executive Directors</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">determined by the board to be independent;</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) material transactions between Newco and News/Sky will require the approval</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of Newco&#8217;s Audit Committee, which will consist exclusively of independent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">non-executive Directors. In addition Newco&#8217;s constitutional documents will</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">provide that such transactions may, depending on materiality, require an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">independent fairness opinion or Newco independent shareholder approval (by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">virtue of Newco applying controls that have equivalent effect to those imposed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by Chapter 11 of the Listing Rules).</span>




 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There will also be a number of commercial agreements between News/Sky and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Newco, including a long-term carriage agreement which will provide Newco with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a significant and committed long term revenue stream. None of the commercial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">agreements between News/Sky and Newco will give News /Sky any right to influence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the editorial content of Sky News.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A business plan for Sky News and a latter from News&#8217; financial advisers regarding</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the suitability of Sky News for admission to trading will be made available to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State in due course.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-22"><a href="#para5-22" name="para5-22">5.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The thinking behind the proposal was that by preserving a separate legal identity for Sky News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and by safeguarding its editorial freedom, Ofcom&#8217;s plurality concerns would be sufficiently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">addressed. Allen & Overy argued:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref251" href="#footnote251">251</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Ofcom states in paragraph 5.46 of the Report that: &#8220;As a result, today [Sky News]</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">makes a strong and positive contribution to plurality. [...] The proposed transaction</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would result in Sky ceasing to be a distinct media enterprise from News Corp.&#8221; The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">attached UIL proposal, under which Sky News would be spun off as an independent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">legal entity, will fully safeguard the status quo as regards the editorial independence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of Sky News and will ensure that Sky News remains as a distinct media enterprise and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">independent broadcast voice. This fully addresses all of the concerns identified by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Ofcom in its Report and relied upon by Ofcom in recommending to the Secretary of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">State that he refer the Transaction to the CC.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The UIL will therefore remedy, mitigate or prevent any purported effects resulting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from the Transaction which have been identified by Ofcom as potentially adverse to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the public interest.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-23"><a href="#para5-23" name="para5-23">5.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt&#8217;s initial reaction was that the UIL was: &#8220;...<span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> pretty</span><span style="font-style:italic"> big</span><span style="font-style:italic"> offer.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> mean</span><span style="font-style:italic"> they</span><span style="font-style:italic"> were</span><span style="font-style:italic"> basically</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">saying &#8211; this was a decision I had about news plurality, and they were saying that they would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">exclude the one news organisation that&#8217;s part of BSkyB from the whole deal.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref252" href="#footnote252">252</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-24"><a href="#para5-24" name="para5-24">5.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 20 January 2011, a second high level meeting between Mr Hunt and James Murdoch</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">took place to enable News Corp to expand upon its written submissions and to speak to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its proposed UIL. Both parties took the meeting very seriously. Mr Hunt was accompanied</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by a number of DCMS officials, independent specialist counsel, and both of his SpAds. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch brought Mr Michel and others. At the outset Mr Hunt explained that he was still</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">minded to refer the case to the Competition Commission, notwithstanding News Corp&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">written submissions. He maintained that the low threshold for referral combined with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear disagreement between Ofcom and News Corp was leading him to the view that a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">referral for further investigation was the reasonable approach. He would though be prepared</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to consider UIL as an alternative to referring the matter.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-25"><a href="#para5-25" name="para5-25">5.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Undeterred by Mr Hunt&#8217;s clear indication that he was minded to refer, the minutes show</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that News Corp maintained its furious rebuttal of the Ofcom report with a lengthy series of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">points, although there is no indication that they moved Mr Hunt from his provisional view.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Secretary of State was much more receptive in principle to the UIL, which were discussed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">next, but he was not prepared to be rushed when it came to the detail. He concluded that:</span>


 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...he was prepared to explore the proposal but would want to look very closely at the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">detail, including the implications for financial viability of an independent Sky News.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref253" href="#footnote253">253</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-26"><a href="#para5-26" name="para5-26">5.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Next steps were outlined. They involved publication of redacted versions of the Ofcom report</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and of News Corp&#8217;s written submissions. Mr Hunt would announce that he was minded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to refer the bid to the Competition Commission but that he was first going to explore the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potential remedy offered by News Corp. Mr Hunt would start this process by reverting both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Ofcom and the OFT for further advice. The involvement of these regulatory bodies at every</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">turn, even when not required by statute, was to become the hallmark of Mr Hunt&#8217;s formal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach to the bid. An undertaking that the representations and UIL reflected the position</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of BSkyB was sought together with fully worked up UIL. The Secretary of State made it clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that in the event that he was minded to accept the UIL, there would be a statutory public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consultation.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-27"><a href="#para5-27" name="para5-27">5.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt described Mr Murdoch as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> cross&#8221;</span> about the continued involvement of Ofcom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because &#8220;...<span style="font-style:italic"> he</span><span style="font-style:italic"> considered</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> tantamount</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> wanting</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> kill</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> deal,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> because</span><span style="font-style:italic"> he</span><span style="font-style:italic"> believed</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that Ofcom would use every mechanism at their disposal ...&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref254" href="#footnote254">254</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> It</span><span style="font-style:normal"> is</span><span style="font-style:normal"> certainly</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> case</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> this</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was one of a number of steps which Mr Hunt took during the process which were not to News</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Corp&#8217;s liking.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-28"><a href="#para5-28" name="para5-28">5.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At a meeting between lawyers on 21 January 2011, Allen & Overy advanced arguments which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appear to have been designed to reduce the role of OFT and Ofcom, or even to dissuade the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State from reverting to them. The firm also argued that early publication of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom report would harm the process. These arguments, although properly made, were not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accepted and are mentioned because they are illustrative of the procedural history and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">careful approach of DCMS and its advisers in relation to News Corp.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref255" href="#footnote255">255</a></sup></span>

<h3>Consideration of the proposed UIL: advice and consultation</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-29"><a href="#para5-29" name="para5-29">5.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Fully worked up draft UIL were provided by News Corp on 24 January 2011 and the next day</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt made a written statement to Parliament explaining the timeline and process which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he had followed up to that point, as well as making public the fact that he was minded to refer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thebid to theCompetition Commission but was first considering the UIL offered by News Corp.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">His meetings with News Corp and Ofcom were covered and the statement was accompanied</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by publication of the December reports from OFT and Ofcom, the latter in redacted form, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State&#8217;s &#8220;minded to&#8221; letters and the resulting submissions from both BSkyB and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News Corp (in redacted form). On their face, the written ministerial statement and associated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press release appeared to be models of transparency. But, as is explored further below, there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had in fact been a considerable volume of private communication with News Corp going on</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">behind the scenes which is not mentioned in the statement.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref256" href="#footnote256">256</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-30"><a href="#para5-30" name="para5-30">5.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Formal letters were sent by Mr Hunt both to Ofcom and the OFT on 27 January 2011. Ofcom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was asked, pursuant to s106B Enterprise Act 2002, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> ...for</span><span style="font-style:italic"> advice</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> extent</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> which</span><span style="font-style:italic"> you</span></span>

<p id="para-id-5-31"><a href="#para5-31" name="para5-31">5.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both regulators were asked to respond within 14 days and both met that deadline with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responses dated 11 February 2011. Ofcom recognised the proposed UIL as a significant step</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by News Corp and regarded UIL, in principle, as a solution to its plurality concerns. However,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it did not consider that the UIL proposed by News Corp afforded sufficiently tight governance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arrangements to meet those concerns and it outlined four governance requirements which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it felt had to be met:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref260" href="#footnote260">260</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Board of Newco should consist of a majority of independent directors,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;independent directors&#8221; being directors who have no other News Corporation or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">News Corporation associated interest;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Board of Newco, including the independent non executive directors, should have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a combination of both senior editorial and business experience/expertise;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Chairman of Newco, should be an independent non executive;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There should be a sub-committee of the Board of Newco to oversee editorial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">independence and integrity of Newco&#8217;s services (&#8220;the Board Editorial Committee&#8221;).&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-32"><a href="#para5-32" name="para5-32">5.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom had been in contact with News Corp which had responded to Ofcom in terms indicating</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a willingness to meet the first two concerns and proposing an alternative solution in respect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the fourth: an alternative which was described by Ofcom as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> promising</span><span style="font-style:italic"> basis</span><span style="font-style:italic"> from</span><span style="font-style:italic"> which</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Without such an undertaking, it would be open to the Newco Board to appoint a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Chairman who is affiliated with News Corporation. Given the nature of Newco and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">its relationship with News Corporation as set out above, we consider this would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">undermine the effectiveness of the proposed UIL in meeting our plurality concerns</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the credibility of the undertakings.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-33"><a href="#para5-33" name="para5-33">5.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The OFT set out a number of additional undertakings which it considered that it would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary for News Corp to give in order to ensure that the UIL were practical and viable in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the short to medium term. It also identified an &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> essential</span><span style="font-style:italic"> structural</span><span style="font-style:italic"> limitation&#8221;</span> in that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">carriage agreement at the heart of the scheme was of finite duration, warning that: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> The</span><span style="font-style:italic"> OFT,</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">however, considers that the finite duration of the carriage agreement, in particular, entails</span>






 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a material risk to the long term viability of Newco and hence the UIL.<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref263" href="#footnote263">263</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Ofcom</span><span style="font-style:normal"> appears</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been less concerned about this factor, considering the proposed ten year duration for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the carriage agreement to be long term in the context of the industry dynamics of the media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sector.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref264" href="#footnote264">264</a></sup> Otherwise Ofcom did not have anything to add to the OFT&#8217;s assessment.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-34"><a href="#para5-34" name="para5-34">5.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCMS officials advised Mr Hunt to permit more time to see whether News Corp was prepared</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to amend its UIL so as to meet the regulators&#8217; concerns.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref265" href="#footnote265">265</a></sup> Mr Hunt did so but set News Corp</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a very tight deadline of 24 hours in which to indicate in principle that it would make the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary changes.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref266" href="#footnote266">266</a></sup> It amounted to an ultimatum, the core part of which was worded in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the following terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref267" href="#footnote267">267</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There are therefore four critical matters which need to be resolved if I am to consider</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">accepting your undertakings:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Board of Newco would need to be independently chaired. I agree with Ofcom&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">assessment that, without such an undertaking, the Newco Board could appoint a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Chairman who is affiliated with News Corporation which would undermine the spirit</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and potentially the practical effect of undertakings designed to address concerns</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about plurality.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There needs to be a non-reacquisition commitment as set out by the OFT. Whilst I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">understand that it is proposed that this could lapse after 10 years, I quite understand</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the OFT&#8217;s concern that there should not be a &#8220;carve-out&#8221; in the event of a third party</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bid for Newco.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The key contracts would need to be approved by me. At a minimum this would cover</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the carriage agreement and the brand licensing agreement. I would anticipate asking</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Ofcom and the OFT to advise me on these contracts at the appropriate time.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There needs to be more clarity around the definition of &#8220;material transactions&#8221; (as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">identified in para 8.11 of the OFT report) and the assets to be transferred (paragraph</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">9.7 &#8211; 9.14).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There are also a number of other important issues where there is agreement in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">principle, or a large measure of agreement, and these too would need to be agreed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and incorporated into the undertakings in lieu.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">If you are unwilling to agree to the necessary changes, I will refer the merger to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Competition Commission. If, on the other hand, you will accept that in principle</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">these changes can be made, and confirm that to me within 24 hours, I will formally</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ask Ofcom and the OFT to continue their discussions with News Corp with a view</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to producing as soon as possible a set of finalised undertakings in lieu which I can</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consider. If I then propose to accept those finalised undertakings in lieu of a reference,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they can then be published and consulted on as the legislation requires.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-35"><a href="#para5-35" name="para5-35">5.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The consequences for News Corp, and James Murdoch personally, of accepting these further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">restrictions were not insignificant as Mr Hunt explained to the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref268" href="#footnote268">268</a></sup></span>






 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. In other words, [the Chairman of Newco] wouldn&#8217;t be Mr James Murdoch?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. That was a very, very significant thing for Mr Murdoch. I mean you know, News</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Corporation thinks that one of its primary functions is what it says on the tin, is news.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He first of all didn&#8217;t think he should have to spin off Sky News at all because he didn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">believe there was a plurality issue with the original proposal, and this was going</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to cost him hundreds of millions of pounds more; but secondly, he was at the time</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">chairman of BSkyB, and that included being chairman of Sky News, and he thought he</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would &#8211; he wanted to continue to be chairman. I think that was pretty important to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">him. And Ofcom did not want that, and so they &#8211; so that was then presented to me.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There were other things that Ofcom &#8211; there were other concerns. There was a concern</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that they wanted to have very strict measures in place to stop News Corporation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">buying additional shares above 39 per cent. James Murdoch was very concerned, for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">example, that a commercial rival would come in and purchase the other 61 per cent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the shares and that might mean that he lost control of Sky News forever...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-36"><a href="#para5-36" name="para5-36">5.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The short deadline prompted a swift response from James Murdoch who indicated by letter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dated 16 February 2011 that News Corp was willing to agree to the suggested changes and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enclosed draft amended UIL.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref269" href="#footnote269">269</a></sup> This assent caused Mr Hunt formally to write to both OFT and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom on 17 February 2011 asking them to agree a set of undertakings with News Corp and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sky so that he could make a final decision.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref270" href="#footnote270">270</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-37"><a href="#para5-37" name="para5-37">5.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 1 March 2011 the OFT reported back to the Secretary of State communicating the news</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that satisfactory amendments had been proposed and enclosing draft UIL bearing the same</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">date.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref271" href="#footnote271">271</a></sup> Its conclusions were expressed in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref272" href="#footnote272">272</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In light of the amendments proposed by News, and subject to prior approval of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">key agreements, as described above, the OFT advises the Secretary of State that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Revised UIL are likely to be practically and financially viable in the short and medium</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">term (that is, no more than 10 years).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The OFT also advises the Secretary of State that the amendments made to the Revised</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">UIL do not address the essential structural limitation identified in the Report, that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">UIL offered are unlikely to be practically and financially viable over the long term.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The relevance of this limitation ultimately depends on the time horizon which the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State, advised by Ofcom, considers relevant to ensure the effectiveness</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the UIL in addressing any media plurality concerns. The OFT notes that Ofcom&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">advice of 11 February 2011 sets out its views on the dynamics of the industry.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-38"><a href="#para5-38" name="para5-38">5.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The same day Ofcom expressed its view that the revised proposed undertakings did address</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the concerns which it had expressed in its 31 December 2010 report. Ofcom had also seen</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the latest report from the OFT and expressed its agreement with it.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref273" href="#footnote273">273</a></sup></span>





 <p id="para-id-5-39"><a href="#para5-39" name="para5-39">5.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Accepting the advice, Mr Hunt proceeded to the next step which was to announce, on 3</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">March 2011, a statutory consultation exercise soliciting views as to whether the proposed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">UIL were sufficient to remedy, mitigate or prevent the public interest concerns in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media plurality raised by the merger. The Notice of Consultation allowed until 21 March 2011</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for responses.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref274" href="#footnote274">274</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-40"><a href="#para5-40" name="para5-40">5.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was an enormous response to the consultation exercise from an extraordinary variety</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of respondents. Solicitors Slaughter and May, who had been in regular correspondence with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCMS about the bid before having this formal opportunity to make submissions, lodged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">detailed submissions on behalf of the Alliance.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref275" href="#footnote275">275</a></sup> BT, despite itself being a part of the Alliance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made an individual submission. Lord Prescott and Tom Watson MP separately wrote to urge</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Secretary of State to act upon the emerging evidence of criminal wrongdoing at the News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the World (NoTW), a theme which was to take on a growing significance in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the bid. They were amongst around 140 MPs who wrote to DCMS. The trade unions BECTU</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the NUJ both responded, as did the TUC. Academics and individuals and companies</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from within the media industry added their voice, as did significant numbers of ordinary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">members of the public. Organised email campaigns instigated by pressure groups Avaaz and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">38 Degrees resulted in tens of thousands of responses. Solicitors DLA Piper, acting for Avaaz,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made detailed written submissions. Other not-for-profit or campaigning organisations also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responded. The consultation even elicited a number of responses from the United States</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of America written by those who were unhappy with News Corp&#8217;s activities in that country.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When the consultation period ended, DCMS had received 38,687 responses, of which about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">37,700 were the product of the internet campaigning.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref276" href="#footnote276">276</a></sup> Most were hostile to the UIL.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref277" href="#footnote277">277</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By the time the response to the consultation was announced, the number had grown still</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">further.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-41"><a href="#para5-41" name="para5-41">5.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whilst the consultation was taking place, Mr Hunt and his officials were thinking ahead and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in particular, considering how best to meet key opponents of the bid. The internal e-mail of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an official on 14 March 2011 recorded his thinking:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref278" href="#footnote278">278</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Many thanks for briefing SoS this morning on the Newscorp/BSkyB merger.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">On the consultation and the process of analysing the responses, SoS was clear that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we should take the necessary time to examine the substantive points raised about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the UIL. His priority was to ensure that the final UIL are robust and viable in the long</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">term. We must take care to avoid possible loop holes.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and opponents of the merger. To that end SoS agreed he would consider requests for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">meetings once written evidence had been submitted. In particular, SoS wanted the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">alliance of bodies working through Slaughter and May to be aware of this position</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and his willingness to meet, given the representations they have made throughout</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">this process.&#8221;</span>





 <p id="para-id-5-42"><a href="#para5-42" name="para5-42">5.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt continued to make maximum use of the assistance available to him from Ofcom and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the OFT writing to both on 18 March 2011, before the consultation had closed. He sought their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advice on those responses which were material to the practical and financial viability of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposed UIL, enclosing some at that juncture. The remaining material representations and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a summary of all consultation responses were to follow. Mr Hunt also sought the regulators&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advice in relation to the detailed provisions on carriage, brand licensing and certain operation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">agreements set out in the proposed UIL which were later provided by News Corp.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref279" href="#footnote279">279</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">an in-house lawyer and a member of the DCMS Media Team. Ofcom and the OFT were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">represented, at the suggestion of the Alliance. For the Alliance there were representatives</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from Trinity Mirror, Guardian Media Group, Telegraph Media Group, Associated News and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Media, and Slaughter and May. The Alliance explained the basis of its opposition to the UIL</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and support for a referral to the Competition Commission which the Secretary of State then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discussed with them.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref280" href="#footnote280">280</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-44"><a href="#para5-44" name="para5-44">5.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCMS had asked the Alliance&#8217;s public affairs advisers, Weber Shandwick, not to attend.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Internal DCMS emails evidencing the debate which led to this decision reveal that there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were differences of opinion. It is striking that amongst those arguing against their attendance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was Adam Smith who wrote: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> No</span><span style="font-style:italic"> public</span><span style="font-style:italic"> affairs</span><span style="font-style:italic"> advisors</span><span style="font-style:italic"> from</span><span style="font-style:italic"> News</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Corp</span><span style="font-style:italic"> were</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> any</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> our</span></span>

<p id="para-id-5-45"><a href="#para5-45" name="para5-45">5.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There followed a period during which three Labour politicians, Ivan Lewis MP (Shadow</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport), Lord Prescott and Mr Watson all pursued</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">correspondence with Mr Hunt about the bid. Mr Lewis wrote on 30 March 2011 raising a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of questions about the bid and asking whether the Government would, in the light</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the experience, remove politicians from such decisions in the future: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> In</span><span style="font-style:italic"> light</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> very</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">role of politicians in media plurality and cross media ownership decisions is an important</span>

 <p id="para-id-5-46"><a href="#para5-46" name="para5-46">5.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 11 April 2011, Lord Prescott followed up the letter which he had written on 15 March</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2011 during the consultation period with a second letter.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref286" href="#footnote286">286</a></sup> He developed and updated the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">point which he had made earlier about the unfolding story of phone hacking at the News of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the World. During the intervening period, on 8 April 2011, News International had admitted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that its previous investigations had not been thorough enough and indicated that it would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be settling some civil cases. In particular, Lord Prescott asked the Secretary of State to delay</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his decision whilst the Metropolitan Police investigated and warned against approving the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bid. Mr Hunt replied the next day. His stance, at that stage, on phone hacking was that: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> The</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">phone-hacking allegations are of course very serious, but they are matters for the criminal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">courts. They have no bearing on the separate matter of media plurality, and my decision</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the merger could be challenged if I allowed these allegations to colour my view.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref287" href="#footnote287">287</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> He</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also referred to s67(5) of the Enterprise Act 2002 which he considered prevented him from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">widening the scope of the intervention.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-47"><a href="#para5-47" name="para5-47">5.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both of the points which Mr Hunt raised in response to Lord Prescott were the subject of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further thinking and advice at DCMS. So far as the phone hacking allegations were concerned,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on 18 April 2011, an official advised Mr Hunt that they might have some relevance to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision on UIL, if the wrongdoing was known about and endorsed or ordered at a senior</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">level within News Corp. The advice was put in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref288" href="#footnote288">288</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The phone-hacking issues as currently admitted by News Corp cannot properly be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">considered by you when making your decision on the matters of plurality which were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">thesubjectofthepublicinterestintervention. However,itis thenatureofundertakings</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that they depend to a certain extent on trust. Our advice is therefore that those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">activities may be relevant to your decision, but only to the extent that they suggested</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that you could not reasonably expect News Corp to abide by their undertakings, for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">example if the wrong-doing was known-of and endorsed or ordered at a senior level</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">within News Corp. This might also be relevant to the level of risk you want to assume</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in relation to the operational agreements (see above).&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-5-48"><a href="#para5-48" name="para5-48">5.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At that stage, Mr Hunt did not believe that the evidence went so far as to give rise to a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question of trust within News Corp, as opposed to NI:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref289" href="#footnote289">289</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;But the advice we got on 18 April did say that the one way that phone hacking</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could impinge was if they thought there was an issue of trust, so that accepting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">undertakings basically meant that you had to be confident that you could trust the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people that you were doing a deal with over those undertakings.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So at that stage it was a matter about News International. It wasn&#8217;t a matter that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there was any evidence at all that it affected News Corporation executives that we</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were dealing with. We thought they had a problem with a company that was part of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">News Corporation group, but there was no evidence, and we didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any legally robust basis to suggest at that stage there was an issue of trust.&#8221;</span>




 <p id="para-id-5-49"><a href="#para5-49" name="para5-49">5.49</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On or about 18 April 2011, the scope of the intervention was raised by the Secretary of State</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within his Department. Insofar as is material, an email of that date from Paul Oldfield, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State&#8217;s Principal Private Secretary, read:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref290" href="#footnote290">290</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">SoS asked whether we could/should look to invoke the PI test re &#8220;fit and proper</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">A related email between Jon eff and Rita Patel, referring to that quoted above, put it this</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref291" href="#footnote291">291</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;See below, SoS raised two points</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">B) wants to make sure we&#8217;ve thoroughly kicked the tires on scope for invoking the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">standards limb of the pi test.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Someone has suggested to him that we could instigate a new reference because</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information has come to light (on phone hacking) which wasn&#8217;t available to vince c</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">when he took the original decision. I was doubtful but agreed to check.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-50"><a href="#para5-50" name="para5-50">5.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the result Mr Hunt did not seek to widen the scope of the intervention. Whether he had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the power to do so would have been an interesting legal question.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref292" href="#footnote292">292</a></sup> He stuck to the line</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which he had adopted in correspondence, namely that s67(5) prevented him from doing so.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of course, whether or not he had the power to amend or replace the original EIN, Ofcom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at all times had the power to remove BSkyB&#8217;s broadcasting licence if it believed that that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">company was not a fit and proper person to hold it. In September 2012, that was a question</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which Ofcom did ultimately address concluding, after James Murdoch had stepped down as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chairman, that it was a fit and proper person. Of significance to the Inquiry&#8217;s consideration of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the bid is the fact that, by asking the questions and raising the issues recorded in the internal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">emails quoted above, Mr Hunt demonstrates an open mind and a desire to act properly.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-51"><a href="#para5-51" name="para5-51">5.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was a further exchange of letters when, on 24 May 2011, Lord Prescott copied an article</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the Guardian reporting criticism of News Corp by former US Vice President Al Gore.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref293" href="#footnote293">293</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt replied on 27 June 2011 pointing out the limited remit of his decision, and assuring</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Prescott that he would only accept UIL which were legally robust and enforceable and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which addressed the media plurality concerns.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref294" href="#footnote294">294</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-52"><a href="#para5-52" name="para5-52">5.52</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Meanwhile, on 19 April 2011, Mr Watson also wrote to Mr Hunt, following up a letter which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he had sent on 24 January 2011, before the consultation. His first letter had raised phone</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking at the NoTW (to the extent then known) and urged Mr Hunt to widen the scope</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of his intervention to include News Corp&#8217;s commitment to broadcasting standards. He had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concluded:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref295" href="#footnote295">295</a></sup></span>






 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;So egregious are these breaches that I am surprised that you have not already</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">commissioned Ofcom to test News Corp&#8217;s commitments to broadcasting standards. I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">request that you do so now as a matter of urgency.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-53"><a href="#para5-53" name="para5-53">5.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt had replied to the earlier letter on 8 February 2011 pointing out (as he later did to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Prescott) that s67(5) of the Enterprise Act 2002 prevented him from making a further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intervention in the case.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref296" href="#footnote296">296</a></sup> Mr Watson&#8217;s second letter updated his first because News Group</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News Ltd had, in the meantime, admitted liability in some of the civil claims arising from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail hacking. He repeated his call for a widening of the scope of the intervention,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggesting an amendment to the original EIN and argued that any UIL given by News Corp</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be unreliable:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref297" href="#footnote297">297</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Clearly News&#8217;s [sic] illegal activities render them unsuitable to own Sky and I believe</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you ought to specify this as a public interest consideration. If it is the position under</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the enterprise Act that there may be only one intervention notice given to the OFT</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">then the notice should be amended to add reference to the broadcasting standards</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">commitments mentioned above particularly in the context of News&#8217;s [sic] admission</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of guilt; and the matter should be referred once more to Ofcom to carry out further</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigations in this regard. You should dismiss the UIL being offered by News</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">since they patently cannot be relied upon and the matter should be referred to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Competition Commission for a detailed investigation.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-54"><a href="#para5-54" name="para5-54">5.54</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Watson wrote again on 10 May 2011 to communicate the fact that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> other</span><span style="font-style:italic"> criminal</span><span style="font-style:italic"> trials</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have been launched that strengthen my original concerns&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> chase</span><span style="font-style:normal"> for</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span><span style="font-style:normal"> response.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref298" href="#footnote298">298</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt responded on 17 May 2011 explaining that an EIN, once issued could not be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">amended, but that Ofcom has the power at any time to remove a broadcasting licence from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a broadcaster it does not believe to be a fit and proper person. He only had power to refer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the case to the Competition Commission on plurality grounds but assured Mr Watson that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he would only accept UIL if they were legally robust and enforceable.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref299" href="#footnote299">299</a></sup> The internal emails</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">referred to above corroborate that this was indeed Mr Hunt&#8217;s intention.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-55"><a href="#para5-55" name="para5-55">5.55</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Watson sought to continue the correspondence with a further letter on 21 June 2011</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seeking a full list of News Corp shareholders but events soon overtook this request.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref300" href="#footnote300">300</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-56"><a href="#para5-56" name="para5-56">5.56</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The fact that the regulators were making &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> good</span><span style="font-style:italic"> progress</span> &#8221; in their dealings with News Corp,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> now</span><span style="font-style:italic"> responded</span><span style="font-style:italic"> positively</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> virtually</span><span style="font-style:italic"> all</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> key</span><span style="font-style:italic"> issues</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> (eventually)</span><span style="font-style:italic"> provided</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom and the OFT had been joined in their scrutiny of the commercial agreements which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would give effect to the proposed UIL by solicitors Pinsent Masons, instructed by the Secretary</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of State to scrutinise them from the commercial perspective of Newco. Their work added an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">additional dimension to the checking process.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref302" href="#footnote302">302</a></sup></span>







 <p id="para-id-5-57"><a href="#para5-57" name="para5-57">5.57</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It took until 22 June 2011 for the OFT and Ofcom to complete and deliver their advice. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">OFT had not been moved fundamentally by the responses to the consultation but it had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acted on a number of suggestions for the improvement to the UIL which News Corp had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">eventually adopted. The OFT put it this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref303" href="#footnote303">303</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Reviewed Responses do not, individually to collectively, provide reasons for the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">OFT to change the fundamental tenor of its March Advice.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">However, the Reviewed Responses do provide suggestions as to how the 1 March</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">UIL could be improved so as to improve the practical and financial viability of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proposed UIL. The OFT has discussed these improvements with News, and News has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been willing &#8211; ultimately &#8211; to accept all of the amendments which the OFT regards as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">material and desirable...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-58"><a href="#para5-58" name="para5-58">5.58</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The resulting amendments to the UIL were listed in an Annex to the advice.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref304" href="#footnote304">304</a></sup> Where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggestions or comments had not been taken forward, the OFT explained why. The advice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made clear that none of the amendments could address the essential structural limitation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identified in its December 2010 report which meant that, in its opinion, the UIL were unlikely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be practically and financially viable over the long term.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref305" href="#footnote305">305</a></sup> As for the carriage and brand</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">licensing agreements, they had been discussed and amended in places with the result that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the OFT was satisfied, stating that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref306" href="#footnote306">306</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In light of the changes made, the OFT advises that the Revised Carriage Agreement</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and Revised Brand Licensing Agreement are consistent with the Revised UIL and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">OFT&#8217;s previous advice with regard to their practical and financial viability&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-59"><a href="#para5-59" name="para5-59">5.59</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom similarly reported the strengthening of the UIL in response to issues identified in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responses to the consultation exercise. As to the long term viability of the UIL, it stood by its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">previous position that ten years in the media industry was long term. It pointed out that if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News Corp sought to reacquire Sky News at the end of the period then the public interest test</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under the Enterprise Act 2002 might be triggered if the threshold criteria were met. Ofcom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">put it thus:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref307" href="#footnote307">307</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;As we have previously advised, we agree that the proposed UIL are not a permanent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">solution and that their effectiveness may start to diminish in the run up to the end of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the 10 year period. We consider that a carriage agreement of a 10-year term in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">context of industry dynamics in this sector is long term. This is because we consider</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there is likely to be significant evolution of the market and consumers&#8217; use of news</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and current affairs over the next decade. As a result, the situation with regard to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">plurality may be significantly different in 10 years time.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">As set out above, at the end of the 10 year period, the prohibition on acquisition and</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the carriage agreement come to an end. If News Corporation wished to acquire the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">remainder of the shares in Newco after the end of the 10 year period, a media public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interest test may be triggered if the threshold criteria in the Enterprise Act 2002 are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">met.</span>





 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">In order for the Secretary of State to have sufficient flexibility for dealing with plurality</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">issues we would, however, refer to our previous advice that the Government should</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consider undertaking a wider review of the statutory framework to ensure plurality in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the public interest in the longer term. We believe that the current system is deficient</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in failing to provide for intervention to be considered where plurality concerns arise</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the absence of a relevant corporate transaction involving media enterprises, for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">example as a result of organic growth.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-60"><a href="#para5-60" name="para5-60">5.60</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As had the OFT, Ofcom raised those responses to the consultation which it had not acted upon</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and explained why it had not done so. On the question of the carriage and brand licensing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">agreements, Ofcom was satisfied with revised versions of the agreements dated 15 and 16</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">June 2011 respectively. Overall, Ofcom was satisfied, concluding that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref308" href="#footnote308">308</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;For all the reasons set out above and in our previous letters of advice, we consider</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the revised proposed undertakings offered by News Corporation would address</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the plurality concerns identified in our report of 31 December 2010.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-61"><a href="#para5-61" name="para5-61">5.61</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Secretary of State accepted the advice of the regulators and prepared to make a further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">written ministerial statement. Before doing so he took advice from his officials on what could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and could not be published. It is clear from internal DCMS emails that Mr Hunt wanted to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publish as much as he could, although in the result it was not practicable to publish the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">carriage and brand licence agreements for reasons of commercial confidence. Mr Hunt&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Principal Private Secretary recorded in an email dated 27 June 2011 that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref309" href="#footnote309">309</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;SoS said he would like to press ahead with statement on BskyB on Thursday. SoS said</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he would like to publish all docs (inc brand licensing and carriage agreements &#8211; even</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">if redacted) and would like to press News Corp for those docs this week. We discussed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">having a quick handling meeting this afternoon to discuss draft statement etc...&#8221;</span>

<h3>Provisional acceptance of the amended draft UIL and further consultation</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-62"><a href="#para5-62" name="para5-62">5.62</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Written Ministerial Statement was made on 30 June 2011. It communicated Mr Hunt&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision which was that he was minded to accept the revised UIL, and he was satisfied with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the carriage and brand licensing agreements as amended. He announced a further and rapid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consultation, allowing seven days for further views on the revised UIL.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref310" href="#footnote310">310</a></sup> The statement was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very carefully crafted to emphasise not only that he had engaged both Ofcom and the OFT to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a greater extent than he was obliged to, but also to make clear that he could have accepted</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the original UIL and was exercising his discretion to require more of News Corp. It began:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref311" href="#footnote311">311</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I am today publishing the results of the consultation on the undertakings in lieu I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">launched on 3 March alongside the subsequent advice I have received from Ofcom</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the OFT. The consultation did not produce any information which has caused</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Ofcom and the OFT to change their earlier advice to me. I could have decided to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">accept the original undertakings. However a number of constructive changes have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been suggested, and as a result, I am today publishing a revised, more robust set of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">undertakings and will be consulting on them until midday Friday 8 July.</span>




 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">As previously, I was not required to involve independent regulators in assessing the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">revised undertakings. However I have again done so, and sought their independent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">advice. I am today also publishing that advice, which after careful consideration I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have decided to accept.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-63"><a href="#para5-63" name="para5-63">5.63</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition to the advice, Mr Hunt published the proposed Articles of Association for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Newco&#8221;, the revised UIL and a summary of the responses to the consultation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref312" href="#footnote312">312</a></sup> The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ministerial Statement explained the process and the developments which had taken place</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in consequence of the consultation responses, including all of the changes which he was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">now minded to accept. It then went on to deal with a number of issues which had often</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been raised in the responses to the first consultation including the emerging phone hacking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allegations against the News of the World. At this stage, Mr Hunt unequivocally adopted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the stance that the allegations were immaterial. There was no mention of their potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevance to the reliability of the undertakings. The material part of the statement explained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">why Mr Hunt was then of the view that the allegations should not influence his decision:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref313" href="#footnote313">313</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Some respondents also argued that News Corp could not be relied upon to abide</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by the requirements set out in the undertakings, citing previous guarantees and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">assurances given by News in the past, and the current hacking allegations against</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the News of the World.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I have taken the view that News have offered serious undertakings and discussed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">them in good faith. In all the circumstances and given that the implementation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of those undertakings will be overseen by the Monitoring Trustee and thereafter</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">monitored and if necessary enforced by the OFT, I believe that there are sufficient</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">safeguards to ensure compliance with the undertakings. Furthermore, the various</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">agreements entered into pursuant to the undertakings will each be enforceable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contracts. Therefore whilst the phone hacking allegations are very serious they were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not material to my consideration.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-64"><a href="#para5-64" name="para5-64">5.64</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt regarded the substantive protections afforded by the revised UIL to be very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considerable, describing them in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref314" href="#footnote314">314</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;SoitwasafurtherstrengtheningoftheseUILsinawaythatmadeSkyNewsmassively</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more independent of James Murdoch than it was then or indeed is now.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-65"><a href="#para5-65" name="para5-65">5.65</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The statement concluded, as it had started, in terms designed to engender trust and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">confidence in the process:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref315" href="#footnote315">315</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I am committed to maintaining the free and independent press for which this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">country is famous. I have sought and published independent advice throughout this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">process. I have listened carefully to points made in the consultation and amended the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">undertakings where appropriate. I have also gone for maximum transparency whilst</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">taking reasonable account of commercial confidentiality considerations. I continue</span>




 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to believe that, if I allow this deal to proceed, Sky News will be able to continue its</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">high-quality output and in fact will have greater protections for its operational and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">editorial independence than those that exist today.&#8221;</span>

<h3>The phone hacking scandal and the withdrawal of the bid</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-66"><a href="#para5-66" name="para5-66">5.66</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By this stage, it looked as if the deal was close to being approved. That state of affairs was to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">change very rapidly. The consultation, which lasted until midday on Friday 8 July 2011, took</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">place during a tumultuous week for News International. The phone hacking scandal came to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a head and, on Thursday 7 July 2011, James Murdoch announced that the NoTW was to close.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was, once more, an enormous response to the consultation, as Mr Hunt confirmed in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his evidence:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref316" href="#footnote316">316</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. And you received in that short period of time 156,000 responses. Virtually all</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were, again, anti, weren&#8217;t they?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A. Yes.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-67"><a href="#para5-67" name="para5-67">5.67</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the day that the consultation closed, a post on the DCMS website made clear that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State would now also be considering the impact of the closure of the NoTW on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media plurality. On this point it read:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref317" href="#footnote317">317</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Secretary of State will consider carefully all the responses submitted and take</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">advice from Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading before reaching his decision. Given</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the volume of responses, we anticipate that this will take some time. He will consider</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">all relevant factors including whether the announcement regarding the News of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">World&#8217;s closure has any impact on the question of media plurality. &#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-5-68"><a href="#para5-68" name="para5-68">5.68</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the following Monday, Mr Hunt sought the advice of both Ofcom and the OFT on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">developments. He asked the OFT whether any of the past week&#8217;s revelations caused it to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reconsider any of its previous advice:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref318" href="#footnote318">318</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;However, given the well-publicised matters involving the News of the World in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">past week, and which have led to the closure of the paper, I should be grateful if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you could let me know whether you consider those revelations and allegations cause</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you to reconsider any part of your previous advice to me, or otherwise gives rise</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to concerns, on the credibility, sustainability and practicalities of the undertakings</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">offered by News Corporation.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-69"><a href="#para5-69" name="para5-69">5.69</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In particular, Ofcom was asked whether the events that followed its letter of 22 June 2011</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">changed in any way the advice it had offered as regards three areas:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref319" href="#footnote319">319</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The closure of the News of the World in the last week is a significant change to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">media landscape. I would be grateful if you could indicate whether this development</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(and/or the events surrounding it) gives you any additional concerns in respect of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">plurality over and above those raised in your initial report to me on this matter</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">received on 31 December 2010.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">progress. In particular I would be grateful if you could clarify whether in your view,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">your current consideration or any potential future decision in relation to the fit and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proper persons test might have an impact on the merger and my decision on media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">plurality or on the proposed undertakings in lieu.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Given the well-publicised matters involving the News of the World in the past week</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that led to its closure, I would be grateful if you could let me know whether you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consider that any new information that has come to light causes you to reconsider</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any part of your previous advice to me including your confidence in the credibility,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sustainability or practicalities of the undertakings offered by News Corporation.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-70"><a href="#para5-70" name="para5-70">5.70</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt impressed upon the Inquiry the gravity of the watershed moment which had led him</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to write to Ofcom and OFT, describing it in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref320" href="#footnote320">320</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Then wehad the horrific Milly Dowler revelations on 4 July, which I don&#8217;t think anyone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could not have been touched by, and then a couple of days later News Corporation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">announced that they were closing the News of the World.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">That, for me, was a very, very significant moment because then I began to wonder</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whether there could be a management issue that spread beyond News International</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to News Corp, and even if it wasn&#8217;t an issue of trust, even if I accepted that the people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that we were negotiating the UILs with, &#8230; were doing so in good faith, I asked myself,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">if they found it necessary to close down a whole newspaper &#8211; this is a big, big deal for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a company like News Corporation &#8211; is there a corporate governance issue here? Is this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a company that actually doesn&#8217;t have control of what&#8217;s going on in its own company,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">even if the management don&#8217;t know about what&#8217;s happening?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So it was really that and, of course, the fact that there was a plurality issue with a big</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspaper being closed down and the fact that Ofcom had been asked to investigate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whether BSkyB was a fit and proper licence holder for a broadcasting licence, those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">came together. So a week after the Milly Dowler revelations I wrote to both Ofcom</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the OFT to ask them whether they still stood by the advice they&#8217;d given me at the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">end of June that plurality considerations had been addressed by the UILs as they did</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">then.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-71"><a href="#para5-71" name="para5-71">5.71</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Faced with a crisis, James Murdoch decided to withdraw the UIL with the inevitable result</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that Mr Hunt decided to refer the proposed transaction to the Competition Commission. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch explained his decision in a letter to Mr Hunt later on 11 July 2011:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref321" href="#footnote321">321</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...we have listened and considered public sensitivity, political concern and the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">requests for an independent Competition Commission review. In these circumstances</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I have taken a decision to withdraw the undertakings. This will allow the matter to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">considered by the Competition Commission on an objective and fair basis taking into</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">account factors and evidence which are relevant to the only applicable legal test of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sufficiency of media plurality.</span>


 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">News Corporation continues to believe that properly taking into account those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">factors its proposed acquisition will not lead to there being insufficient plurality in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">news provision in the UK.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-72"><a href="#para5-72" name="para5-72">5.72</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt announced his decision to refer the proposed merger to the Competition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commission in Parliament on the afternoon of 11 July 2011. The terms in which he expressed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">himself reflected the dramatic change in atmosphere which the previous week&#8217;s events had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wrought:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref322" href="#footnote322">322</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...As a result of News Corporation&#8217;s announcement this afternoon I am going to refer</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this to the Competition Commission with immediate effect and will be writing to them</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this afternoon.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Today&#8217;s announcement will be an outcome that I am sure the whole house will</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">welcome.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It will mean that the Competition Commission will be able to give further full and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">exhaustive consideration of this merger taking into account all relevant recent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">developments.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mr Speaker, protecting our tradition of a strong, free and independent media is the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">most sacred responsibility I have as Culture Secretary. Irresponsible, illegal and callous</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">behaviour damages that freedom by weakening public support for the self-regulation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">upon which it has thrived. By dealing decisively with the abuses of power we have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">seen, hopefully on a cross-party basis, this government intends to strengthen and not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">diminish press freedom, making this country once again proud and not ashamed of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the journalism that so shapes our democracy.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-73"><a href="#para5-73" name="para5-73">5.73</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Avaaz sought to seize the moment to press the case for the Secretary of State to issue a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">new EIN widened in scope to include not only plurality but also commitment to broadcasting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards. The group did so on 12 July 2011 by sending DCMS a Note, produced by counsel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expert in merger and competition law, which challenged the view that s67(5) of the Enterprise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Act 2002 prevented the Secretary of State from widening the scope of the intervention.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Counsel concluded:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref323" href="#footnote323">323</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Although I cannot claim that the position is certain, I can say that in my view, given</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the factual context set out above, any attempt by News Corporation to challenge a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decision by the Secretary of State to issue a further Notice allowing him and the CC to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consider fitness would be more likely than not to fail, notwithstanding section 67(5)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the EA02.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">...</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I should make it clear that I am not saying that the Secretary of State is bound now</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to issue a replacement Notice allowing fitness to be examined as a public interest</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consideration. His discretion is a wide one. However, in the present circumstances,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the view that he definitely cannot lawfully do so seems to me to be far too cautious.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-74"><a href="#para5-74" name="para5-74">5.74</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Intheresult,thatlegalargumentdidnotneedtoberesolvedbecausealthoughthetransaction</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was formally referred to the Competition Commission on 13 July, News Corp subsequently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">withdrew its bid and, on 25 July 2011, the reference was cancelled by the Competition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commission.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref324" href="#footnote324">324</a></sup></span>



 <p id="para-id-5-75"><a href="#para5-75" name="para5-75">5.75</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The speed at which a proposed transaction such as News Corp&#8217;s bid for BSkyB is considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may itself be commercially sensitive (in this case there can be no doubt that, for News Corp,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was the sooner the better). From the point of view of the public interest there will also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generally be a need to deal with this sort of decision promptly because it would not be in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest for regulatory delay to thwart a deal deserving of approval. However, that need</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for promptness in the public interest will always be qualified by the public interest in ensuring</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the proposed transaction is considered sufficiently to ensure that the right decision is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made. In this case the speed at which the bid was actually considered was consistent with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest. Mr Hunt described himself as wanting to do things &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> briskly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> but</span><span style="font-style:italic"> properly&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref325" href="#footnote325">325</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He certainly sought to avoid unnecessary delay but when time was needed fully to consider,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">take advice about, and to consult upon the UIL, it was afforded.</span>

<h3>Lobbying behind the scenes</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-76"><a href="#para5-76" name="para5-76">5.76</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition to the considerable volume of responses which were the product of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State&#8217;s specific invitations to interested parties to make submissions, there was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a remarkable amount of additional unsolicited communication. Some of this came from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Alliance, whose solicitors and public relations advisers actively sought to influence the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State through correspondence. These contacts though paled in comparison to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the voluminous behind the scenes contact between Mr Michel and people at the DCMS.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In particular, Mr Michel had a great deal of email, text and telephone contact with Adam</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Smith. It is now well known that the publication of Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s exhibit KRM18, which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidenced some of this contact, led very quickly to Mr Smith&#8217;s resignation. It is therefore now</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary to consider the nature and extent of unsolicited and behind the scenes lobbying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whilst the bid was Mr Hunt&#8217;s responsibility.</span>
<h4>The Alliance</h4>

<p id="para-id-5-77"><a href="#para5-77" name="para5-77">5.77</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Like News Corp, the Alliance had begun to lobby DCMS before the transfer of the bid. Emails</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the period 8 to 10 December 2010 show that there was a meal attended by representatives</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of DCMS and Weber Shandwick, after which the latter offered and the former accepted a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">briefing on &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> plurality</span><span style="font-style:italic"> issue&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref326" href="#footnote326">326</a></sup> The DCMS official made clear (as was the case at that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stage) that DCMS had no formal role but Weber Shandwick was still keen to get its client&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">message across: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> ...I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> know</span><span style="font-style:italic"> you</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> no</span><span style="font-style:italic"> formal</span><span style="font-style:italic"> role</span><span style="font-style:italic"> but</span><span style="font-style:italic"> good</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span><span style="font-style:italic"> you</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hear</span><span style="font-style:italic"> our</span><span style="font-style:italic"> case</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> why</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we think there is a change&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref327" href="#footnote327">327</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-78"><a href="#para5-78" name="para5-78">5.78</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 26 December 2010, the bid then having been transferred to Mr Hunt, Weber Shandwick</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">copied Slaughter and May&#8217;s submission to Ofcom to DCMS.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref328" href="#footnote328">328</a></sup> The next day the firm sent the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">results of a poll conducted by the Alliance to a DCMS official.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref329" href="#footnote329">329</a></sup> DCMS wisely cancelled the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">planned briefing but Weber Shandwick thereafter remained in email contact with DCMS.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of the briefing an in-house legal adviser wrote: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> ...I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> don&#8217;t</span><span style="font-style:italic"> think</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> presentation</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> any</span></span>





 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">event, to Jeremy, but given recent events, I think that we ought to distance from any remote</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">suggestion of influence by any interested party&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref330" href="#footnote330">330</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-79"><a href="#para5-79" name="para5-79">5.79</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When reports emerged that News Corp was discussing remedies with the Secretary of State,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Weber Shandwick was quick to ask for a meeting which was declined.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref331" href="#footnote331">331</a></sup> The firm also sought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">early sight of Ofcom&#8217;s report which it was not granted on the ground that the Secretary of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">State would publish the report, in redacted form, in due course.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref332" href="#footnote332">332</a></sup> Weber Shandwick later</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">forwarded copies of letters from Slaughter and May dated 12 and 20 January 2011 (discussed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further below) but did not add substantively to them.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref333" href="#footnote333">333</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-80"><a href="#para5-80" name="para5-80">5.80</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Slaughter and May also wrote directly to the Secretary of State on a number of occasions,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">typically following reports in the media about the progress of the bid. On 12 January 2011,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the firm wrote after reports in the (FT) that discussions about UIL had commenced. UIL had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in fact only been mentioned at the meeting between Mr Hunt and James Murdoch on 6</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">January 2011 as something which News Corp wanted to discuss if their primary submission</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that Mr Hunt should not refer the bid failed. The first draft UIL had not yet been submitted to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Secretary of State. Slaughter and May pointed to the low threshold for a reference to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Competition Commission, arguing that remedies should not be considered before a referral,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and seeking further information. TSol replied on behalf of the Secretary of State with a letter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which, amongst other things, gently made clear that, if and when the time came for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Alliance to make submissions, then they would be sought.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref334" href="#footnote334">334</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-81"><a href="#para5-81" name="para5-81">5.81</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At that stage, Mr Hunt was, in any event, minded to refer the bid and had not yet formed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">even a provisional view about the UIL. He was not then obliged to hear submissions from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Alliance. Indeed, on the question of referral they would have been otiose and on UIL</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">premature. When later, after taking advice from Ofcom and the OFT, the Secretary of State</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">became minded instead to accept the UIL, he launched a consultation (to which the Alliance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was able to and did respond).</span>

<p id="para-id-5-82"><a href="#para5-82" name="para5-82">5.82</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Slaughter and May was not content to wait. On 20 January 2011 the firm made further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unsolicited submissions, this time following publication by the (FT) of news that News Corp</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had offered to divest Sky News. It argued that it would be difficult to achieve an effective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remedy without wholesale divestment of BSkyB and pressed again for a reference to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Competition Commission.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref335" href="#footnote335">335</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-83"><a href="#para5-83" name="para5-83">5.83</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When the Secretary of State announced that he was asking the OFT and Ofcom to advise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">him on News Corp&#8217;s proposed UIL, and would go out to public consultation if he provisionally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decided to accept the same, Slaughter and May wrote to him seeking to be involved at an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">earlier stage. On 27 January 2011 they wrote, inter alia:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref336" href="#footnote336">336</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Youonlyproposetogoouttopublicconsultationhowever,afteryouhaveprovisionally</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decided (in the light of the advice from OFT and Ofcom) to accept such undertakings.</span>







 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">In order to ensure that the overall process is both fair and thorough, it will therefore</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be critical for Ofcom / OFT and the Secretary of State to consult with key industry</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">players (including the Concerned Parties) ahead of the provisional decision.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-84"><a href="#para5-84" name="para5-84">5.84</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Alliance did not get the early involvement that it was seeking and so Slaughter and May</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wrote again, on 9 February 2011, making a veiled threat to judicially review the Secretary of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">State. It persisted with the argument for early involvement:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref337" href="#footnote337">337</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We understand that the process you envisage would require Ofcom (working with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">OFT) to assess undertakings in lieu of reference to the Competition Commission</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(&#8220;the CC&#8221;) without the involvement of interested third parties. Third parties would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">instead only be consulted after Ofcom / OFT have reported to you and after you have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">concluded that you are minded to accept such undertakings.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It is our view that this process would be unfair and would fail to meet the normal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">procedural standards of merger control and public law more generally.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">If your decision is to meet public law requirements of fairness, it is essential that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interested third parties are properly consulted before Ofcom / OFT report to you and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">before you propose to accept undertakings.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">In the absence of the above safeguards, the review will be procedurally unsound.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-85"><a href="#para5-85" name="para5-85">5.85</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">TSol replied on behalf of the Secretary of State on 11 February 2011 refuting the allegations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of unfairness and repeating the point, more bluntly this time, that the Alliance would have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an opportunity to make submissions at an appropriate time if the need arose. The letter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concluded:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref338" href="#footnote338">338</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Proper and, as you put it, meaningful consultation does not require multiple</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">iterations of comment throughout a decision making process such as this one. The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">important point is that you and your clients are given an opportunity properly to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">comment on any proposal to accept undertakings in lieu of a reference. You will have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that opportunity.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Finally, I cannot but emphasise that if, and I stress if, the Secretary of State does reach</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a view that he proposes to accept undertakings in lieu of a reference, he will carefully</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consider any observations you and your clients may have about those proposed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">undertakings.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-86"><a href="#para5-86" name="para5-86">5.86</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Slaughter and May nevertheless continued with its effort to get the Alliance more deeply</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">involved at an earlier stage, writing again on 1 March 2011, this time following another article</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the (FT) which had been published on 24 February 2011 on the subject of the proposed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">UIL. It sought an outline of the key features of any remedy proposals made by News Corp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the opportunity for the Alliance to discuss the proposals with OFT and Ofcom prior to them</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advising the Secretary of State; and the opportunity to discuss the remedy proposals with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Secretary of State prior to any provisional decision or substantive announcement which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he may make on the issue.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref339" href="#footnote339">339</a></sup> The firm&#8217;s repeated representations about process were then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">overtaken by events when the Secretary of State reached the provisional view that he was</span>



 <span style="font-size: 15px;">minded to accept UIL from News Corp and consequently initiated a statutory consultation.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As has already been recited above, Slaughter and May submitted lengthy and detailed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">submissions as part of that process and subsequently attended the Secretary of State&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meeting with Alliance members on 24 March 2011.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-87"><a href="#para5-87" name="para5-87">5.87</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In March 2011 Weber Shandwick was involved in arrangements for the Secretary of State&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meeting with the Alliance.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref340" href="#footnote340">340</a></sup> The firm itself was at the last minute asked not to attend that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meeting with the result that News Corp had an internal public affairs officer in attendance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when James Murdoch met the Secretary of State, but the Alliance was prevented from having</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an equivalent, albeit external, adviser present.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-88"><a href="#para5-88" name="para5-88">5.88</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, there was a brief email exchange between Weber Shandwick and DCMS in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the former sought information and asked whether their further input was needed. The firm</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">received a brief and entirely proper response.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref341" href="#footnote341">341</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-89"><a href="#para5-89" name="para5-89">5.89</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of observations flow from a consideration of the Alliance&#8217;s unsolicited</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">communications. First, there was a qualitative difference between its lobbying efforts and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those of News Corp in that it was, essentially, conducted through emails to officials and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">formal correspondence. The approach to lobbying by News Corp extended well beyond that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, at least in part, took the form of Mr Michel&#8217;s indefatigable use of text messaging, email</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the telephone.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-90"><a href="#para5-90" name="para5-90">5.90</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, the financial stakes associated with the proposed transaction, and the passions which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it aroused, caused the Alliance, through its solicitors, to push as hard as it could to be heard</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">throughout the process. It is almost inevitable that exactly the same will happen when the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">next major qualifying media transaction falls to be considered under the Enterprise Act 2002.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-91"><a href="#para5-91" name="para5-91">5.91</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Third, the veiled threat of judicial review from the Alliance, when combined with the equally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">threatening correspondence from News Corp&#8217;s lawyers, amply demonstrates the need for a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">process which is both robustly and manifestly fair to all parties if it is neither to be impugned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in court nor impossibly slow.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-92"><a href="#para5-92" name="para5-92">5.92</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These three observations all point to the desirability of detailed procedural guidance being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">available for a Secretary of State responsible for administering quasi-judicial decisions under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Enterprise Act 2002 and for a fair yet workable procedure to be established and followed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">throughout. That need is made all the more clear after a consideration of the lobbying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undertaken by Mr Michel.</span>
<h4>Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Michel&#8217;s contact with Jeremy Hunt</h4>

<p id="para-id-5-93"><a href="#para5-93" name="para5-93">5.93</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On Christmas Eve, some three days after responsibility for the bid had been transferred to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt, Mr Michel sought to lay the ground to make use of the channel of communication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which he had previously established with the Secretary of State. With characteristically</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">friendly (even intimate) and informal tone, he texted:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref342" href="#footnote342">342</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Hi. James has asked me to be the point of contact with you and Adam throughout</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the process on his behalf. Glad Jon eff is in charge of dossier. Have a great Christmas</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with baby! Speak soon. Fred&#8221;</span>



 <p id="para-id-5-94"><a href="#para5-94" name="para5-94">5.94</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt immediately appreciated that, as the decision maker, he was now in a very different</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">position and properly informed Mr Michel that all contact from then onwards needed to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">through official channels until the decision had been made:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref343" href="#footnote343">343</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Thanks Fred. All contact with me now needs to be through official channels until</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decision made. Hope Daddy has a lovely Xmas. Jeremy&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-95"><a href="#para5-95" name="para5-95">5.95</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel held back, but only for a short while. He cautiously resumed communication by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">text on 20 January 2011 following the second of the two formal meetings about the bid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to which he had accompanied James Murdoch. He was careful not to mention the bid, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">sent:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref344" href="#footnote344">344</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Great to see you today. We should get [names redacted] together in the future to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">socialise! Nearly born the same place! Warm regards. Fred&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-96"><a href="#para5-96" name="para5-96">5.96</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt&#8217;s brief reply implicitly made clear that any socialising with Mr Michel would have to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">await resolution of the bid but in terms which made slight reference to the bid:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref345" href="#footnote345">345</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Good to see u too. Hope u understand why we have to have the long process. Let&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">meet up when things are resolved J&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-97"><a href="#para5-97" name="para5-97">5.97</a></p>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">very impressive yesterday. And yes let&#8217;s meet up when it&#8217;s all done. Warmest regards</span>

<p id="para-id-5-98"><a href="#para5-98" name="para5-98">5.98</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel did not text Mr Hunt again until 3 March 2011, the day on which Mr Hunt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">announced to Parliament that he was minded to accept News Corp&#8217;s UIL, when he again</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resorted to flattery:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref347" href="#footnote347">347</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;You were great at the Commons today. Hope all well. Warm regards, Fred&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-99"><a href="#para5-99" name="para5-99">5.99</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That text led to two more within a few minutes of the first. Mr Hunt replied briefly: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Merci</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">large drink tonight!&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Michel</span><span style="font-style:normal"> concluded</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> exchange</span><span style="font-style:normal"> on</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span><span style="font-style:normal"> similarly</span><span style="font-style:normal"> friendly</span><span style="font-style:normal"> note:</span><span style="font-style:normal"> &#8220;</span> Me too!</span>

<p id="para-id-5-100"><a href="#para5-100" name="para5-100">5.100</a></p>
 There were two more exchanges during the currency of the bid.</span> First, on<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 13</span> March<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011, Mr
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Michel praised Mr Hunt&#8217;s performance in an interview: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> good</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Marr.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> As</span><span style="font-style:italic"> always!</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Fred&#8221;</span> .</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt&#8217;s reply amounted to a polite reminder of the bid and consequent need for some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">distance: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Merci</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hopefully</span><span style="font-style:italic"> when</span><span style="font-style:italic"> consultation</span><span style="font-style:italic"> over</span><span style="font-style:italic"> we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> can</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> coffee</span><span style="font-style:italic"> like</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> old</span><span style="font-style:italic"> days!&#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref349" href="#footnote349">349</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-101"><a href="#para5-101" name="para5-101">5.101</a></p>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">was in progress: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Agree</span><span style="font-style:italic"> he</span><span style="font-style:italic"> MUST</span><span style="font-style:italic"> win!</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Let&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> do</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> when</span><span style="font-style:italic"> all</span><span style="font-style:italic"> over</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref350" href="#footnote350">350</a></sup> During his oral evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt candidly reflected on Mr Michel&#8217;s 3 July 2011 text, stating:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref351" href="#footnote351">351</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s incredible ingenuity. I mean he was just looking for any opportunity he</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could try and establish contact of some sort or another. You know, it was pushy . You</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know, I responded briefly, courteously, and in a friendly way as well.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">What I didn&#8217;t deduce from this, and I think you alluded to in earlier comments, was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the effect of this kind of contact multiplied many, many times over to Adam Smith.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">And that was the crucial thing right at the beginning of the process that we didn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">foresee, the fact that there was going to be such a volume of correspondence, ...&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(emphasis added)</span>

<p id="para-id-5-102"><a href="#para5-102" name="para5-102">5.102</a></p>
 It is conspicuous that all of the exchanges during this period were initiated by Mr Michel. All
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were brief. The bid was barely touched upon and there was no substantive communication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">either about the substance of the bid or the process. It was all about making the connection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the personal level. Mr Hunt was careful to put off any social arrangements until after the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bid. His responses were consistent with the general approach which he took to those in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media industry with whom he came into contact during the bid. In evidence, he explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref352" href="#footnote352">352</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...what I&#8217;m really saying in paragraph 37 is that because of my other duties as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State, I was going to be bumping into people who had views on the bid.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think during that period I spoke at the Oxford Media Convention where the whole</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">media world would be gathered and I gave a speech and answered questions and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there would have been coffee afterwards, and so there would have been &#8211; but they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were brief interactions, and I interpreted that to mean there might be a casual</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">comment about the bid, but they weren&#8217;t part of my consultation process.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and later he said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref353" href="#footnote353">353</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;All the interactions which related to the decision that I was going to take would be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">through official channels, but as I explained there, if I bumped into someone in a lift</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or gave a courteous reply to a text message, I didn&#8217;t think that was off limits.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-103"><a href="#para5-103" name="para5-103">5.103</a></p>
 It would have been prudent for Mr Hunt politely to have insisted that Mr Michel should not
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seek to communicate (whether by text or otherwise) until after the bid had been resolved,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thus enforcing the wish which he expressed at the outset on 24 December 2010. Doing so</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would have prevented any suggestion of the appearance of bias arising from the contact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which in fact occurred. The direct contact between Mr Hunt and Mr Michel which did occur</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not entirely satisfactory but, having said that, I should make it clear that I do not consider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, on its own, it would have been sufficient to impugn the process had it been the subject</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of judicial review.</span>




 <h4>James Murdoch and Jeremy Hunt</h4>

<p id="para-id-5-104"><a href="#para5-104" name="para5-104">5.104</a></p>
 Mr Hunt also exchanged text messages with James Murdoch during the period in which he
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was responsible for the plurality decision. On the evening of 3 March 2011, the day on which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt announced that he was minded to accept the UIL and launched the first statutory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consultation about them, James Murdoch sent a text in appreciation: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Big</span><span style="font-style:italic"> few</span><span style="font-style:italic"> days.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Well</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">played. JRM&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Hunt</span><span style="font-style:normal"> replied:</span> &#8220;Thanks think we got right solution!&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> He</span><span style="font-style:normal"> followed</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">next day with a text which had nothing to do with the bid but was connected to the sporting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">element of his portfolio: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Just</span><span style="font-style:italic"> been</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Team</span><span style="font-style:italic"> GB</span><span style="font-style:italic"> cycling</span><span style="font-style:italic"> team</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Manchester</span><span style="font-style:italic"> who</span><span style="font-style:italic"> are</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">most impressed with the personal interest you show in their performance!&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref354" href="#footnote354">354</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-105"><a href="#para5-105" name="para5-105">5.105</a></p>
 There was then an exchange of messages on 31</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> March, initiated by Mr Hunt who wished
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to congratulate Mr Murdoch upon his promotion. The Secretary of State&#8217;s message joked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about Mr Murdoch&#8217;s relationship with Ofcom: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Many</span><span style="font-style:italic"> congratulations</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> promotion</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">although I am sure u will really miss Ofcom in NY! Jeremy<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span><span style="font-style:normal"> The</span><span style="font-style:normal"> reply</span><span style="font-style:normal"> recognised</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> there</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were constraints on contact whilst the fate of the bid remained unresolved: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Thanks</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Jeremy</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; sadly I fear they won&#8217;t see the back of me that easily! Hopefully we can move our other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">business forward soon so we can catch up properly. Best<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref355" href="#footnote355">355</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-106"><a href="#para5-106" name="para5-106">5.106</a></p>
 Mr Hunt was clear that his reference to Ofcom was tongue in cheek and that it had no impact
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the process. However, if faced with the same situation again, he said that he would just</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">avoid all text messages:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref356" href="#footnote356">356</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Were you at all uncomfortable communicating with Mr James Murdoch in this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">way?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Well, I think, you know, as we look at the whole way quasi-judicial processes are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">run and as we look at the lessons that we learned from what happened between</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Adam Smith and Mr Michel, I think there are probably things we would learn, and my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interpretation of my quasi-judicial role was that a courteous reply to a text message</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was fine. I think probably now I wouldn&#8217;t take the same view, and I would just avoid</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">all text messages, but that was my assessment, that it had absolutely no impact</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the process . It was not material to the decision I took, and it was just me being</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">courteous.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>
<h4>Jeremy Hunt and Andy Coulson</h4>

<p id="para-id-5-107"><a href="#para5-107" name="para5-107">5.107</a></p>
 On the advice of Sue Beeby,</span> his SpAd who dealt predominantly with media<span style="font-weight:normal;"> relations, Mr
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Hunt drew the line at meeting Andy Coulson whilst a decision about the bid was pending.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He had been intending to have a drink with Mr Coulson and Ms Beeby advised by email.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Referring to News Corp, she wrote: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> He&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> so</span><span style="font-style:italic"> closely</span><span style="font-style:italic"> linked</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> them</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> if</span><span style="font-style:italic"> you</span><span style="font-style:italic"> were</span><span style="font-style:italic"> seen</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wouldn&#8217;t look great.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Hunt</span><span style="font-style:normal"> thought</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> advice</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> &#8220;</span> absolutely right&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> it</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> wiser</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> wait</span> &#8221;<span style="font-style:italic"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref357" href="#footnote357">357</a></sup> This approach was in keeping with his decisions not to meet Mr Michel or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Murdoch socially whilst he was responsible for the decision about the bid.</span>




 <h4>Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Michel and Adam Smith</h4>

<p id="para-id-5-108"><a href="#para5-108" name="para5-108">5.108</a></p>
 In his dealings with Adam Smith, Mr Michel founda more communicative target for his
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lobbying endeavours. The type and volume of their communications during the currency</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the bid is, of itself, striking and well illustrates just how deftly Mr Michel managed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inveigle his way to a source so close to the Secretary of State. There were numerous emails,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">many telephone calls and, most of all, a prolific number of text messages. No fewer than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">690 text messages passing between Mr Michel and Mr Smith were found on the image of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel&#8217;s iPhone covering the period 27 August 2010 to 11 July 2011, the majority sent by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref358" href="#footnote358">358</a></sup> All but three of these messages post dated the transfer of the bid to Mr Hunt,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the manifestation of a step change in the attention which Mr Michel paid to Mr Smith once</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation of the bid rested in Mr Hunt&#8217;s hands.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref359" href="#footnote359">359</a></sup> The evidence from Mr Michel&#8217;s iPhone was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but one piece in the jigsaw of evidence which, when put together and analysed led to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">following overall statistics being put to Mr Michel in evidence and with which he did not take</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">issue:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref360" href="#footnote360">360</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Can I move on now to your communications with Mr Adam Smith. Would you agree</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that there was a pattern of very frequent text messages, telephone calls and emails</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with Mr Smith, which certainly increased from December 2010?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A. Yes.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Overall, over the period June 2010 to July 2011, we have counted the following:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">191 telephone calls, 158 emails, 799 texts, of which over 90 per cent were exchanged</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with Mr Smith. Does that feel about right?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I didn&#8217;t know the quantum, but I trust your counting.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Over the period 28 November 2010 to 11 July 2011, we have counted 257 text</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">messages sent by Mr Smith to you, and given that you were more prolific in your texts</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to him than he was to you, there would be more than that which you sent. Would you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">agree?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I would.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-109"><a href="#para5-109" name="para5-109">5.109</a></p>
 The content of these communications was further evidenced by Mr Michel&#8217;s numerous
<span style="font-size: 15px;">emails to his colleagues within News Corp, often including James Murdoch, reporting on his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">activities and exhibited by Rupert Murdoch as KRM18. Publication by the Inquiry of KRM18</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">began to bring the full extent of the contact between Mr Michel and Mr Smith into the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">domain. On the basis of that evidence, Mr Hunt&#8217;s Permanent Secretary, Jonathan Stephens,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described how he quickly assessed the communications to have been unacceptable:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref361" href="#footnote361">361</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...The first suggestion that the contacts went beyond what was proper was 24<span style="font-size: 9px;"> th</span> April</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2012 with the release of emails from Frederic Michel (and this was the first occasion I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recall mention of Michel by name). The following morning I told the Secretary of State</span>




 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I thought the number, extent, depth and tone of contacts suggested by those e-mails</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">went beyond what was acceptable&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-110"><a href="#para5-110" name="para5-110">5.110</a></p>
 After time for reflection and after both Mr Michel and Mr Smith had given their oral evidence
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Inquiry, Mr Stephens remained of the same view, saying:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref362" href="#footnote362">362</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The first thing I thing I would say is that I have to be clear that I think, as I&#8217;ve said,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the extent, the number, the nature of these contacts was, in my judgment, clearly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">inappropriate and not just in one or two disputed cases. I think that&#8217;s a judgment I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">just have to place on record.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-111"><a href="#para5-111" name="para5-111">5.111</a></p>
I agree with that assessment. In doing soI have taken into account that there wasa oftena
<span style="font-size: 15px;">degree of hyperbole and inaccuracy in Mr Michel&#8217;s email reports of his exchanges with Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Smith with which Mr Smith rightly and unsurprisingly took issue. I recognise that the majority</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the contact was initiated by Mr Michel, not Mr Smith, and that some of the individual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">communications were innocuous, concerning either anodyne matters of process or being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mere repetition of what News Corp had already been told formally. I also recognise that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Smith had held himself out as being a point of contact for News Corp. But none of that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">escapes the fact that Mr Michel and Mr Smith engaged in a very considerable volume of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private communication about the bid, much of which was clearly inappropriate for reasons</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which are examined further below.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-112"><a href="#para5-112" name="para5-112">5.112</a></p>
 Before turning to the detail of the exchanges in the period after the bid was transferred to
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt, it is instructive first to examine the status of SpAds, the rules which applied to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Smith, his working relationship with Mr Hunt, and how he was managed, supervised,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">instructed and guided.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-113"><a href="#para5-113" name="para5-113">5.113</a></p>
 SpAds are temporary civil servants appointed under Article 3 of the Civil Service Order in
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council 1995. They are unique amongst civil servants because they are exempt from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">general requirement that civil servants should be appointed on merit and behave with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impartiality and objectivity so that may retain the confidence of future Governments of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different political complexion. Indeed, they are political appointees, appointed by Ministers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the approval of the Prime Minister. The amalgamation of civil servant and political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">partisan into the same post makes for a hybrid position.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref363" href="#footnote363">363</a></sup> A SpAd&#8217;s appointment ends at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the end of the administration which appointed him (or her) or when the appointing Minister</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">leaves the Government or moves to another appointment.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref364" href="#footnote364">364</a></sup> The Code of Conduct for Special</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Advisers (&#8220;the Code&#8221;) explains the nature of the role of a Special Adviser, in the following</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref365" href="#footnote365">365</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Special advisers are employed to help Ministers on matters where the work of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Government and the work of the Government Party overlap and where it would</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be inappropriate for the permanent civil servants to become involved. They are an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">additional resource for the Minister providing assistance from a standpoint that is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more politically committed and politically aware than would be available to a Minister</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from the permanent Civil Service.&#8221;</span>




 <p id="para-id-5-114"><a href="#para5-114" name="para5-114">5.114</a></p>
 Paragraph 3 of the Code lists and describes types of work whicha Special Adviser can be
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expected to undertake. There is no mention of assisting a Minister acting in a quasi judicial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">capacity.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref366" href="#footnote366">366</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-115"><a href="#para5-115" name="para5-115">5.115</a></p>
 The Code makes clear that management and conduct of SpAds,</span> including<span style="font-weight:normal;"> discipline, rests with
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the appointing Minister, subject to the overriding power of the Prime Minister to terminate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the employment of a SpAd by withdrawing his consent to their appointment. The material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">part of paragraph 4 of the Code reads:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref367" href="#footnote367">367</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...The responsibility for the management and conduct of special advisers, including</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">discipline, rests with the Minister who made the appointment. It is, of course, also</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">open to the Prime Minister to terminate employment by withdrawing his consent to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an individual appointment&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-116"><a href="#para5-116" name="para5-116">5.116</a></p>
 The appointing Minister&#8217;s responsibility for the management and conduct ofa SpAd is
<span style="font-size: 15px;">repeated at paragraph 3.3 of the Ministerial Code which also describes the accountability of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ministers for their actions and decisions in respect of their SpAds:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref368" href="#footnote368">368</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The responsibility for the management and conduct of special advisers, including</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">discipline, rests with the Minister who made the appointment. Individual Ministers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">will be accountable to the Prime Minister, Parliament and the public for their actions</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and decisions in respect of their special advisers&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-117"><a href="#para5-117" name="para5-117">5.117</a></p>
 The Code imposesa duty of confidence upon SpAds in these terms:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref369" href="#footnote369">369</a></sup>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...Special advisers should not, without authority, disclose official information which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">has been communicated in confidence in Government or received in confidence from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">others...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-118"><a href="#para5-118" name="para5-118">5.118</a></p>
 Mr Stephens had,</span> amongst his many duties, an advisory role<span style="font-weight:normal;"> as:</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> &#8220;...the</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> principal</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> adviser</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> to

<span style="font-size: 15px;">respect, overall responsibility for the handling of the bid and he oversaw the process. His</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advisory role to his Minister in relation to all decisions and questions of conduct was wide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enough in principle to encompass advice to Mr Hunt as to the use to which Mr Smith was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">put in relation to the bid and how he discharged that role. It was advisory only, of course; the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decisions about the deployment and management of the SpAd were for Mr Hunt.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-119"><a href="#para5-119" name="para5-119">5.119</a></p>
 Pursuant to his advisory role, it had been Mr Stephens who drew to the attention of Mr Hunt
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Mr Smith not only the Code of Conduct for Special Advisers but also the Ministerial Code</span>







 <span style="font-size: 15px;">andtheCivilServiceCodewhenMrHunttookofficeandMrSmithwasappointed.Mr Stephens</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">saw it as his role to provide advice in relation to these codes in case of uncertainty, stating:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref373" href="#footnote373">373</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;These Codes are drawn to the attention of Ministers on appointment by the Cabinet</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Secretary. I write to Special Advisers on their appointment to draw their attention to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Code of Conduct of Special Advisers &#8211; I wrote to Adam Smith on 14 May 2010 (this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">letter is attached). I also brief both Ministers and Special Advisers on the importance</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of abiding by these Codes and my availability to provide advice in any uncertainty. It</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is also my practice to explain to Special Advisers that, in all external dealings, they will</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be seen as representing their Department and Minister.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-120"><a href="#para5-120" name="para5-120">5.120</a></p>
 Mr Smith was one of two SpAds who worked for Mr Hunt. He concentrated on policy
<span style="font-size: 15px;">development whilst the other SpAd, Sue Beeby (after October 2011, Lisa Hunter) dealt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">primarily with media relations.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref374" href="#footnote374">374</a></sup> Mr Smith knew Mr Hunt very well and vice versa. He had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">worked for him since 2006 as his Parliamentary Researcher and then Chief of Staff, before</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">becoming a SpAd when Mr Hunt was appointed as Secretary of State after the May 2010</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">General Election. In Mr Smith&#8217;s words:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref375" href="#footnote375">375</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...we developed a very close working relationship. He came to know my approach</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to matters and my style, which is generally relaxed, courteous and seemingly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">accommodating&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-121"><a href="#para5-121" name="para5-121">5.121</a></p>
 Mr Hunt&#8217;s</span> evidence was unequivocally to the same<span style="font-weight:normal;"> effect. He was sure that Mr Smith would
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have known what he thought on different issues:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref376" href="#footnote376">376</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...I doubt there&#8217;s a minister who worked more closely with a special adviser than I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">worked with Adam Smith, I really did work very closely with him for best part of six</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">years, I think it was a given that he would know what I thought on different issues. I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s quite the same as speaking for me, which is a different thing, but I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think people would have expected him to know my views&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-122"><a href="#para5-122" name="para5-122">5.122</a></p>
 Geographically,</span> at DCMS, the<span style="font-weight:normal;"> SpAds&#8217;</span> office was on the same floor as the Ministers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref377" href="#footnote377">377</a></sup> Mr
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Smith described a high level of professional contact with Mr Hunt but a lesser degree of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contact with him about News Corp&#8217;s bid for the remaining shares in BSkyB:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref378" href="#footnote378">378</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Mr Hunt and I saw each other almost every working day and we spoke frequently</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the telephone. Over the years, I considered that I developed a close professional</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relationship with Mr Hunt. He was familiar with my approach and style. The regular</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">meetings, to which I refer above, and our more informal, regular, contact provided</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">him with opportunities to obtain updates from me in relation to the projects with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which he had asked me to become involved and I would provide updates, as I mention</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">above, either at our meetings, by telephone or more informally at the office. We did</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not socialise together that often &#8211; we only went for drinks on a handful of occasions,</span>






 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the time that we worked together, although I did attend his wedding along with a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">couple of other staff at the time&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and in relation specifically to the bid:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref379" href="#footnote379">379</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Not as frequent as it &#8211; as you might have thought, I suppose. I mean there was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">[sic] the meetings which I&#8217;ve listed there, but I would &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t go and speak to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">him about it on anything like a sort of daily basis or even &#8211; it would only be if he was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">preparing for a major statement or if there were the odd occasions where an issue</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that I judged to be of significant interest to him, that I would go and speak to him</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about it, but he &#8211; the whole point of having the department, the officials and myself,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I suppose, was so that we could kind of carry on which the work and not need to go</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">running to him every day.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-123"><a href="#para5-123" name="para5-123">5.123</a></p>
 Mr Smith understood his role in practice to require three things of him:</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> ...to</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> be</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> [Mr</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> Hunt&#8217;s]
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;eyes and ears&#8221; inside and outside of the Department; to act as an early warning system on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">issues of importance; and to be a &#8220;buffer&#8221; between him, other Ministers, officials and outside</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">organisations so that he could focus on his work<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref380" href="#footnote380">380</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> The</span><span style="font-style:normal"> third</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> these</span><span style="font-style:normal"> capacities</span><span style="font-style:normal"> is</span><span style="font-style:normal"> important</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in understanding the role which Mr Smith believed himself to be playing in his interactions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Mr Michel. In relation to the bid he described his role as:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;To</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> one</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> points</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contact for News Corporation. To act as a buffer and as a channel of communications.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref381" href="#footnote381">381</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-124"><a href="#para5-124" name="para5-124">5.124</a></p>
 Although undoubtedly answerable to Mr Hunt, Mr Smith did not havea line manager of the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">type in place for ordinary civil servants. He explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref382" href="#footnote382">382</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t really have a line manager, if you like, I reported in to Mr Hunt and would sort</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of meet with and talk with the senior officials, including the Permanent Secretary, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there was no sort of manager in that sort of strictest sense of the word, no.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-125"><a href="#para5-125" name="para5-125">5.125</a></p>
 Mr Smith&#8217;s performance was required to be the subject of formal appraisal on an annual
<span style="font-size: 15px;">basis by a number of individuals, one of whom had to be his Secretary of State, Mr Hunt, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">another, the Permanent Secretary, Mr Stephens. Both would have required some familiarity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Mr Smith&#8217;s job description, objectives and day to day performance in order to discharge</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that responsibility.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-126"><a href="#para5-126" name="para5-126">5.126</a></p>
 Mr Smith&#8217;s</span> most recent appraisal, in December<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011, vividly corroborates the very positive
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence which both Mr Hunt and Mr Stephens gave orally about his general performance.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He was extremely highly regarded. Mr Hunt wrote:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref383" href="#footnote383">383</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Adam is an effective operator; bright, articulate, insightful, extremely well briefed</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and an effective communicator. He sees his main task as &#8220;getting things done&#8221;. To</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">date he has been very effective at achieving it.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He is able to me my eyes and ears at meetings I cannot attend and knows exactly what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I would want to happen. He is brilliant at handling difficult situations in a civilised way</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">without compromising on core objectives.</span>





 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">An ideal bridge between the department and Ministers, consistently adds value, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">has been particularly adept at handling issues between Ministers.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-127"><a href="#para5-127" name="para5-127">5.127</a></p>
 Although,</span> as the above appraisal makes perfectly<span style="font-weight:normal;"> clear, Mr Smith wasa talented and able
<span style="font-size: 15px;">SpAd, he had had no previous experience of quasi-judicial decision making prior to his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involvement in the bid. Moreover, he had been a SpAd for only a matter of months and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consequently had limited experience of working in Government as opposed to working in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politics more generally. In those circumstances, it was particularly important that his role in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the handling of the bid should be clearly defined and that he had clear, appropriate guidance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and instruction.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-128"><a href="#para5-128" name="para5-128">5.128</a></p>
 There was,</span> at that<span style="font-weight:normal;"> time, no specific written guidance either for SpAds or more generally for
<span style="font-size: 15px;">departments relating specifically to quasi-judicial decisions and none was specifically issued</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to News Corp&#8217;s bid to acquire BSkyB. On 25 April 2012, the day after publication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of KRM18, the Cabinet Office produced and provided to departments new guidance on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">handling of quasi-judicial process:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Principles</span><span style="font-style:italic"> governing</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> handling</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> quasi-judicial</span><span style="font-style:italic"> decision</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by Ministers.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref384" href="#footnote384">384</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> It</span><span style="font-style:normal"> is</span><span style="font-style:normal"> intended</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> complement</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> range</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> good</span><span style="font-style:normal"> practice</span><span style="font-style:normal"> guidance</span><span style="font-style:normal"> already</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">available to departments on the Cabinet Office website.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref385" href="#footnote385">385</a></sup> Specifically in relation to SpAds,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the new guidance states:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref386" href="#footnote386">386</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Special advisers . Decisions of this sort should not be made by reference to political</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or presentational considerations. This applies regardless of the source of the advice,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and that of special advisers is treated in the same way as advice from an official</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">giving internal advice to Ministers. If a special adviser is approached by an interested</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">party, he/she should refer the matter to the appropriate official . A special adviser</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">so approached must not give the impression that any particular advice will be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">determinative when decisions are taken.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Departments should bear in mind that details of any potentially relevant contacts</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are liable to be disclosed in the event of a challenge to the decision. All Departments</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should have formal written guidance for those involved in decision-making processes.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Such guidance may be of general application. But departments should also consider</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">issuing specific guidance for certain individual decisions, particularly where</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">such decisions arise infrequently, raise issues of unusual sensitivity or are of such</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">complexity or novelty that general guidance is likely to be insufficient to assist in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proper discharge of the decision-making function in accordance with these general</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">principles. All such guidance should be agreed by the relevant Permanent Secretary</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and Legal Adviser.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-5-129"><a href="#para5-129" name="para5-129">5.129</a></p>
 It is commendable that guidance has now been produced and that it was done so quickly
<span style="font-size: 15px;">after the problems identified by the Inquiry&#8217;s examination of the bid exposed a gap in existing</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">guidance. However, it is regrettable that no written guidance was available when DCMS had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to deal with News Corp&#8217;s 2010 bid for BSkyB.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-130"><a href="#para5-130" name="para5-130">5.130</a></p>
 Mr Smith does not appear to have been given any express individual instructions as to how
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he should, or should not, conduct himself with interested parties on matters relating to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">quasi-judicial decision. On this point, Mr Hunt, who was himself new to quasi-judicial process,</span>



 <span style="font-size: 15px;">said that they both relied on meetings with lawyers and officials for an understanding of what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was required of them and that he did not give Mr Smith any express instructions:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref387" href="#footnote387">387</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Any communication between Mr Michel and Mr Smith would be no different,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would it, to communication between Mr Michel and you, because Mr Smith was your</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">agent. Do you agree with that?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Not in this process. I think sometimes special advisers have a role which is about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">speaking for their boss, but in this situation Mr Smith&#8217;s role was a different one. He</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was a point of contact in a very complex process, and there to advise News Corp</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about the questions they had about the process and I think also to reassure them that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the process was fair.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. What express instructions, if any, was Mr Smith given as to what his special role</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">was?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Well, he was present at all the meetings where we had advice from lawyers and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">officials in the department, so he heard that advice, and it was understood that he</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would be a point of contact for News Corp in the process.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. But what express instructions was he given as to the role he would undertake?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I don&#8217;t think he was given any express instructions other than how I&#8217;ve described</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">it.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. So in terms of the discharge of the function which had been allocated to him, your</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">evidence is he would work that out from what he heard at meetings; is that correct?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A. Yes.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Did you give him any instructions as to what not to do?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. No. As I say, he heard in the way that I heard all the things that we needed to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">careful about.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-131"><a href="#para5-131" name="para5-131">5.131</a></p>
 Mr Stephens (who knew that Mr Smith was in contact with News Corp but did not know of
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the volume or detail of that contact) accepted with the benefit of hindsight that Mr Smith</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should have been warned about the risks arising from dealing with a professional lobbyist:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref388" href="#footnote388">388</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. The third point out of my four: the power of advocacy and sophistication of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">lobbyist. Although you didn&#8217;t know [Frederic Michel] personally, or know his exact</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">title, you knew the sort of role he was occupying and that it was his job, really, to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">push as hard as he can to extract as much as he possibly could. Nothing necessarily</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">inappropriate in that, but there was a particular risk, therefore, that the special</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">adviser needed to be alive to and perhaps warned about. Do you accept that issue?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Certainly with the benefit of hindsight I wish we had warned him, and indeed I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think one would necessarily want to warn anyone in contact with him.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-132"><a href="#para5-132" name="para5-132">5.132</a></p>
 It is certainly unfortunate that neither Mr Stephens nor Mr Hunt specifically addressed with
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Smith the risk that if he was to be a point of contact for News Corp, he could well come</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under pressure (at least similar to that of which Mr Hunt had had some experience) which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could be difficult to deal with and so required particular attention. Such attention could not</span>


 <span style="font-size: 15px;">only have covered providing a greater awareness of the consequences of going beyond those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">limits, but also a degree of managerial and pastoral support to ensure that he could deal with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the issues likely to arise. Both have said, in effect, that they simply trusted him to get on with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it by himself.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-133"><a href="#para5-133" name="para5-133">5.133</a></p>
 Both Mr Hunt and Mr Smith did have the benefit of the departmental advice given in
<span style="font-size: 15px;">November 2010 when Mr Hunt had been advised not to contact Dr Cable about the bid.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That advice, which contained the specific phrase &#8220;quasi-judicial&#8221; should have been enough</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to signal that this was not a normal policy or political decision, but it was not detailed advice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about how the Secretary of State and those acting in his name should conduct themselves</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">once responsibility for the bid had transferred to Mr Hunt. The note which both the Secretary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of State and Mr Smith were sent explained that the decision was quasi-judicial and that such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decisions might be judicially reviewed. In particular it warned: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> ...such</span><span style="font-style:italic"> decisions</span><span style="font-style:italic"> are</span><span style="font-style:italic"> case</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">specific and must be taken on the individual merits of the case. They are not decisions about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">broader matters of Government policy as might be decided by Cabinet collectively and must</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be taken by the BIS Secretary of State acting alone.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref389" href="#footnote389">389</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> The</span><span style="font-style:normal"> November</span><span style="font-style:normal"> advice</span><span style="font-style:normal"> did</span><span style="font-style:normal"> not</span><span style="font-style:normal"> address</span></span>

<p id="para-id-5-134"><a href="#para5-134" name="para5-134">5.134</a></p>
 Specific advice about the process was given after the transfer. The first such advice was
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given at the handover meeting on 22 December 2010 at which both the Secretary of State</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Mr Smith were present. There is a documentary record of the meeting in the form of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an internal email but it captures little about what was said generally about quasi-judicial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision making. It records that: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> BIS</span><span style="font-style:italic"> officials</span><span style="font-style:italic"> outlined</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> SoS&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> role</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> process</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span></span>

<p id="para-id-5-135"><a href="#para5-135" name="para5-135">5.135</a></p>
 Both men were also present at an internal meeting on 5</span> January<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011, which was preceded
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by written advice from DCMS officials. The advice is addressed to Mr Hunt but Mr Smith is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not included in the copy addressees. In any event, it deals with next steps rather than the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requirements of a fair quasi-judicial procedure more generally.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref391" href="#footnote391">391</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-136"><a href="#para5-136" name="para5-136">5.136</a></p>
 Mr Stephens in his evidence was confident that the requirements ofa fair process had been
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clearly communicated. He stated:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref392" href="#footnote392">392</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Taken together, the written advice offered on 12 November and on 4 January 2011,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">andtheoraladviceofferedinthemeetingson22Decemberand5January,includingby</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">legal advisers, established in my view clear requirements for how the process needed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to be conducted, namely that this was a quasi-judicial process, in which decisions</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were now for the Secretary of State alone to take, on the basis of objective assessment</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the evidence available to him, taking account of all the relevant considerations and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ignoring any which were irrelevant. He needed to take an even-handed approach,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">giving all sides an appropriate opportunity to make representations, ensuring that</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the process was without bias or the appearance of bias.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-137"><a href="#para5-137" name="para5-137">5.137</a></p>
 When asked about what had been said at the 22</span> December<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2010 meeting he thought avoiding
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bias and the appearance of bias had been specifically mentioned:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref393" href="#footnote393">393</a></sup></span>





 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. BIS officials outlined the Secretary of State role in the process and the various</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">legal considerations. Do you think that the term quasi-judicial was mentioned on that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">occasion, Mr Stephens?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I think it&#8217;s very, very likely.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Was that concept explained?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes. As I recall it, in this meeting and the subsequent meeting, officials took the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State and others quite carefully through the statutory functions, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">stage that had been reached, the next steps, and in particular, rehearsed the need to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">approach the decision with an open mind on a basis that took account of the relevant</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">considerations, ignored the irrelevant, that it was even-handed and avoided bias or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the appearance of bias.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. It&#8217;s the avoidance of bias or the appearance thereof which you feel was mentioned</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on that occasion, do you?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A. Yes.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-138"><a href="#para5-138" name="para5-138">5.138</a></p>
 In some contrast to Mr Stephens&#8217;</span> recollection, Mr<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Smith&#8217;s recollection of what had been
<span style="font-size: 15px;">covered in these meetings was much less definite and, in particular, his understanding of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what a quasi-judicial process required of him was conspicuously vague. As to what had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said at the meeting on 22 December 2010, Mr Smith stated: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> They</span><span style="font-style:italic"> [that&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> BIS</span><span style="font-style:italic"> officials]</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">may also have mentioned that Mr Hunt was to act in a quasi-judicial capacity.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">added)<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref394" href="#footnote394">394</a></sup> Once he had refreshed his memory from the documents he clarified:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref395" href="#footnote395">395</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think my paragraph 44, the minutes that I&#8217;ve seen, it says the process and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">various legal considerations were discussed. So that sort of jogged my memory to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">suggest that quasi official may well have been discussed. I can&#8217;t remember whether</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it definitively was, but we certainly did discuss quasi-judicial on other occasions if not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that one.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-139"><a href="#para5-139" name="para5-139">5.139</a></p>
 Mr Smith was questioned closely on his understanding of quasi-judicial.</span> The<span style="font-weight:normal;"> exchange,
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although lengthy, bears quoting in full because it suggested that Mr Smith did not in fact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fully and truly understand the procedural requirements of a quasi judicial process, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(consistently with Mr Hunt&#8217;s evidence) had not received specific instructions as to what he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could and could not do, not least with reference to avoiding an appearance of bias. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref396" href="#footnote396">396</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. My understanding was that it meant that the decision had to be made only after</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consideringcertainissues,inthiscasenamelymediaplurality;thesortofwiderpolitical</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or other policy issues couldn&#8217;t be taken into account. And then sort of uniquely within</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">government that this was a personal decision for whoever the Secretary of State was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rather than a collective government decision. So a normal policy decision, if you like,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">even though it may well have been Mr Hunt making it. Collective government would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have meant that they were all essentially making that same decision.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. What about any process requirements built into the concept? Were you aware of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">those?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Of the quasi-judicial concepts?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">Q. Yes.</span>



 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Not &#8211; well, the process that we were following was in the Enterprise Act, but I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">didn&#8217;t necessarily link quasi-judicial to &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Let&#8217;s just think about the word judicial a bit, because there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are lots of things I don&#8217;t know much about but I know a bit about that. I&#8217;m sure you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would agree with me that if a judge is trying a case, then he can&#8217;t speak to the parties</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">outside the case and go and chat to them in the evening as the case is going on,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">one side as opposed to the other. You don&#8217;t have to be a lawyer to appreciate that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wouldn&#8217;t be right. I mean, would you agree with that?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I would. I think in this particular instance the quasi-judicial process and the fact</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that you&#8217;re dealing with two interested parties, you obviously do need to discuss lots</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of different things with those interested parties. In fact, you need to, to get certain</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">things to happen.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: But in a way that&#8217;s open and transparent to everybody.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Don&#8217;t you think? Or not?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A. Um ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: It might be that I shouldn&#8217;t be questioning you about what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you viscerally understand about the phrase, but what you were told about the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">phrase. What you were told it meant you could do or what you were told it meant</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">you couldn&#8217;t do.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">A. I wasn&#8217;t told I couldn&#8217;t do anything in particular. It was more about &#8211; because it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">was Mr Hunt&#8217;s decision, the discussion was mainly about what he could or couldn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">do. I don&#8217;t remember being told about myself.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-140"><a href="#para5-140" name="para5-140">5.140</a></p>
 It became clear that Mr Smith had approached the bid procedurally as he would have donea
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision in any other policy area:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref397" href="#footnote397">397</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. So whatever quasi-judicial might have meant in practice, it didn&#8217;t really &#8211; maybe</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I&#8217;m putting it slightly too high, but it didn&#8217;t really bear on what you did or didn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">do because you just proceeded as you would ordinarily have proceeded in any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">straightforward policy area, is that fair?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes, because, as I explained, my understanding of quasi-judicial was that Mr Hunt</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had to decide on media plurality issues and that Mr Hunt himself had to decide on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the bid. Beyond that, there was no difference to the way I approached it. &#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">added)</span>

<p id="para-id-5-141"><a href="#para5-141" name="para5-141">5.141</a></p>
 In the absence of specific instructions,</span> he assumed the role of<span style="font-weight:normal;"> &#8220;point</span> of<span style="font-weight:normal;"> contact&#8221;,</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> &#8220;buffer&#8221;
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and &#8220;channel of communications&#8221; because he had behaved in a like capacity previously:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref398" href="#footnote398">398</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, I had previously carried out that role for other work that the department had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">done and, as we sort of discussed earlier, for Mr Hunt in opposition. It was never, to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my memory, sort of directly said to me, but it was just sort of inferred by me and I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think as we go through, we&#8217;ll see the department sort of assumed that that would be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the case. But there was no sort of direct instruction, if you like, no.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-142"><a href="#para5-142" name="para5-142">5.142</a></p>
 Mr Hunt agreed that Mr Smith&#8217;s</span> role was to bea point of contact.<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Indeed, in the light of the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bid&#8217;s very unhappy procedural history up to that point he positively wanted Mr Smith to be</span>


 <span style="font-size: 15px;">a helpful point of contact for News Corp. But he had not, he said, seen Mr Smith&#8217;s role to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a channel of communication through which to exchange his thoughts with those of News</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Corp:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref399" href="#footnote399">399</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, I think it&#8217;s important to be clear about what we mean by &#8220;channel&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">see Mr Smith in this process as being someone who would be telling me what News</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Corp thought or telling News Corp what I thought. I saw him as a point of contact, an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">official point contact in the process, so that News Corp had someone that they could</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">call if they had concerns about the process, and someone who was there to &#8211; you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know, I mean the situation in which we inherited responsibility for a bid was one in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which News Corp felt they had not been fairly treated, and so I wanted to make sure</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that there was someone there who could answer questions about how the process</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was going in a helpful way.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-5-143"><a href="#para5-143" name="para5-143">5.143</a></p>
 Mr Hunt plainly understood that the decision was for him alone and had to be taken on the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">basis only of relevant considerations, excluding the irrelevant. He no doubt also understood</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he must not act in a biased fashion. But it is not clear that he fully understood just how</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scrupulous he needed to be to avoid the appearance of bias. It was his first quasi-judicial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision and he very fairly accepted that he had learned lessons from the experience:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref400" href="#footnote400">400</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;No, I think what I interpreted &#8211; my interpretation of quasi-judicial, I think, you know,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">obviously having completed this process, one learns lessons, and I&#8217;m not saying I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would necessarily make exactly the same interpretation now, but my interpretation at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the time was that what was important was that the decision was impartial, unbiased,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and that I decided it on the basis of the evidence in front of me, and so that was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">where the transparency was important, but if there was something that was, you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know, a trivial &#8211; not trivial, that&#8217;s the wrong word, but it wouldn&#8217;t necessarily apply</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to every single matter of process.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-144"><a href="#para5-144" name="para5-144">5.144</a></p>
 TheunderstandingdescribedabovefitswithMrHunt&#8217;sactions.Hewasatpainstodemonstrate
<span style="font-size: 15px;">how he went about making his decision, taking advice at every step and publishing relevant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material as far as commercial confidences would permit. But when it came to contact with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel, although he was careful, he did not shut it down altogether. He was also content</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for his SpAd to act as a point of contact for one party to the bid, quietly helping it at least as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">far as matters of process were concerned.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-145"><a href="#para5-145" name="para5-145">5.145</a></p>
 Neither Mr Stephens,</span> nor Mr<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Hunt, had any reservations at the time about Mr Smith being
<span style="font-size: 15px;">used as a point of contact for News Corp. Mr Stephens accepted that it was not necessary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to use a SpAd but his view, based on his experience, was that he expected it to be useful:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref401" href="#footnote401">401</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;My experience in these roles is that often there is a mix between roles and that it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">can often be sometimes useful for similar messages to be passed on both channels.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Certainly in this case, most of the contact was through legal advisers, as I would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expect. There were some exchanges with policy officials and I thought there were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">some exchanges of the equivalent nature with Adam Smith.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">My experience in a number of government departments is that there is not a rigid</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">distinction between special advisers and officials, necessarily.&#8221;</span>



 <p id="para-id-5-146"><a href="#para5-146" name="para5-146">5.146</a></p>
 When asked why he had involveda SpAd at all in the quasi-judicial</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> process, Mr Hunt explained
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he saw a very positive role for Mr Smith in what was an important issue because he was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so close to him:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref402" href="#footnote402">402</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, he was an absolutely key and trusted aide. He is highly intelligent, highly able,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and I believed that he would have a very positive role to contribute in terms of making</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sure that the process was run robustly and in the right way generally. He&#8217;s a very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">talented person and he&#8217;s amongst the officials who are closest to me, so it would have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been quite a natural thing; indeed, I think as Mr Stephens said, entirely proper and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">appropriate for special advisers to be involved in decisions that their ministers &#8211; or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">issues that are very important to their ministers.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-147"><a href="#para5-147" name="para5-147">5.147</a></p>
 There is nothing inherently wrong or inappropriate in the involvement ofa SpAd ina quasi-
<span style="font-size: 15px;">judicial process and no harm necessarily results. It does, however, carry clear risks which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can be avoided by using officials for this role, especially if they have experience in this type</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of decision making. SpAds usually work in the sphere of the political and the presentational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both of which must be put aside for the purposes of making a quasi-judicial decision. Without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specific instruction and adequate supervision there is a risk that they will act as they do,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">entirely legitimately, when dealing with ordinary policy decisions but in a way which is not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commensurate with fair process or compliant with the requirements of public law. The risk is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compounded if, as may well be the case, they are working with parties with whom they have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had contact in contexts not connected with a quasi-judicial decision. For this reason the new</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cabinet Office guidance to SpAds, discussed above, which advises SpAds to refer approaches</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from interested parties to an appropriate official is helpful and prudent.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref403" href="#footnote403">403</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-148"><a href="#para5-148" name="para5-148">5.148</a></p>
 When Mr Michel sought,</span> after<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 21</span> December<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2010, to pursue and exploit the previous contact
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and rapport which he had had with Mr Smith, he was dealing with a SpAd who had not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fully appreciated the sensitivities of such contact in a quasi-judicial context, but who had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understood that his principal wanted him to be helpful to a company which had legitimate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">groundsforcomplaintaboutthebid&#8217;shandlingbyDrCable.Thiswasadangerouscombination.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-149"><a href="#para5-149" name="para5-149">5.149</a></p>
 For his part,</span> Mr Michel wasa professional lobbyist who, whilst charming and<span style="font-weight:normal;"> experienced,
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said that he himself was unaware of the dangers to the process of the contact which he was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">actively encouraging Mr Smith to engage in. It was the first time that Mr Michel had dealt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with such a transaction and the concept of a quasi-judicial decision was not explained to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">him by a lawyer at any stage.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref404" href="#footnote404">404</a></sup> He understood something of the position of the Secretary of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">State recognising that any direct discussions should be formal and minuted but he did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appreciate the need for distance and transparency when dealing with Mr Hunt&#8217;s officials and</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">SpAds:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref405" href="#footnote405">405</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Yes. I think we had discussions on the fact that it was very important that the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decision rested with the Secretary of State, that it was not appropriate to have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">direct discussions with the Secretary of State unless they were formal and minuted,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but beyond that we were in unchartered territory in terms of &#8211; and I&#8217;m speaking in</span>




 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hindsight as well &#8211; in terms of the level of representations that could be made below</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Secretary of State.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">and:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref406" href="#footnote406">406</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;No. I was never of the view that it was inappropriate to at least try to put the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">arguments or make representations to these officers [civil servants and special</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">advisers].&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-150"><a href="#para5-150" name="para5-150">5.150</a></p>
 In the result Mr Michel interacted with Mr Smith without modifying his ordinary approach to
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lobbying so as to reflect the rather special circumstances of this quasi-judicial process.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-151"><a href="#para5-151" name="para5-151">5.151</a></p>
 James Murdoch did not regard the channel of communication between Mr Michel and Mr
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Smith as a secret means of informal indirect communication with Mr Hunt. He did accept</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the obvious point that the propriety of their communications was dependant upon what the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contact was about:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref407" href="#footnote407">407</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Mr Hunt must have taken the view on advice that formal meetings &#8211; and we&#8217;ve</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">seen the minutes of those meetings, 6 January and 20 January 2011 &#8211; were okay,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would not impugn the fairness of the process, but if there is informal contact of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the sort we&#8217;re seeing here, that would be inappropriate and the way to avoid the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">appearance of that is let the informal contact take place secretly between Mr Michel</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the special adviser. Do you see that point?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Mr Jay, respectfully, I disagree with that point. I think he was saying that informal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contact between me and Mr Hunt or others would raise eyebrows, because they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would say, &#8220;What was discussed?&#8221;, et cetera, but general contact at the political</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">level, if you will, at the staff level, around process, around document submissions,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">around &#8211; just to give colour around these things from us, that that was something</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that was acceptable and that was part of the process he was setting up.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. It may depend on what the contact is about. Would you agree?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I suppose so, and I assume we&#8217;re going to keep going through this.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-152"><a href="#para5-152" name="para5-152">5.152</a></p>
 Itis regrettablethatMrMurdoch,towhommanyofMrMichel&#8217;semailreportswereaddressed,
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not at any stage call a halt to, limit or in any sense express concern about the risks that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might be run as a consequence of the nature and extent of the communications between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel and Mr Smith or the fact that they went beyond what was appropriate in a quasi-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">judicial environment.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref408" href="#footnote408">408</a></sup> Mr Murdoch need only have asked himself what the Alliance would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have made of sight of the texts and emails which were passing.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-153"><a href="#para5-153" name="para5-153">5.153</a></p>
 Turning now to the actual substance of the contact between Mr Michel and Mr Smith, it not
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary to rehearse in full the course of their communications. From a consideration of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the relevant evidence as a whole one can discern its defining characteristics. It is conducted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very much on a personal and informal basis. Mr Michel almost invariably adopts a friendly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach, preferring a confrontational stance only very rarely and on key issues. He frequently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">flatters both Mr Smith and his principal, Mr Hunt. There is striking use of the language of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">common cause to communicate a sense of shared purpose. Allied to this is a tone which is</span>



 <span style="font-size: 15px;">occasionally conspiratorial and surreptitious. Mr Michel uses comments unfavourable of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Conservatives&#8217; political opponents presumably designed to communicate that News Corp</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was politically &#8220;on side&#8221;. The majority of the communication is initiated by Mr Michel who is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by far the more pro-active party. The volume of his contact is high, amounting to a &#8216;barrage&#8217; at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">times, as Mr Smith rightly described it.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref409" href="#footnote409">409</a></sup> There was pressure and encouragement to change</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the course of the process as Mr Michel advocated the steps which would have favoured News</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Corp&#8217;s interests.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-154"><a href="#para5-154" name="para5-154">5.154</a></p>
 For his part,</span> Mr Smith was usually brief in his replies, invariably<span style="font-weight:normal;"> courteous, and generally
<span style="font-size: 15px;">friendly. He was very often communicating mundane information about the process or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">repeating matters which Mr Hunt or DCMS officials had already stated in more formal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstances. He stood his ground when pushed in a direction other than that which Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Hunt intended to take. He very often did not pass on the fact, still less the content, of his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">communications with Mr Michel, thereby fulfilling the role of buffer. On occasions, where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he judged it necessary, he did pass on information to Mr Hunt, acting as a conduit.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref410" href="#footnote410">410</a></sup> He was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aware at the time that Mr Michel was trying to extract information from him: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> I&#8217;m</span><span style="font-style:italic"> sure</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that&#8217;s</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what he was trying to do, yes&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref411" href="#footnote411">411</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-155"><a href="#para5-155" name="para5-155">5.155</a></p>
 But there were times when Mr Smith succumbed to Mr Michel&#8217;s tactics and appeared
<span style="font-size: 15px;">momentarily at least to have been drawn in by the narrative of common cause. On one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occasion he found himself joking with Mr Michel about an opponent of the bid. On another,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he joined in criticism of Ofcom. He passed on information about the progress of the bid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that would have been more properly communicated in a much more formal manner. He did</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not make formal notes of the communications. There is an issue (analysed below) about Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Michel&#8217;s source of confidential information about the Government&#8217;s thinking as to the form</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which inquiries arising out of the phone hacking scandal would take: whatever the truth of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the matter, Mr Smith should never have been running any risk of being the source of any but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the most inconsequential information.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-156"><a href="#para5-156" name="para5-156">5.156</a></p>
 The above impressions can be illustrated by reference toa few salient examples.</span> On<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 10
<span style="font-size: 15px;">January 2011, the telephone records showed three calls between Mr Michel and Mr Smith</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">totalling 27 minutes, 55 seconds.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref412" href="#footnote412">412</a></sup> There is also an email from Mr Michel to James Murdoch</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and others. It is clear from the email that Mr Smith had told Mr Michel about the reaction of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ed Richards (of Ofcom) to the points on which Mr Hunt had sought clarification from him.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref413" href="#footnote413">413</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ultimately, Mr Smith did not dispute that he had done so and correctly pointed out that it had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">always been Mr Hunt&#8217;s intention that News Corp should be informed of the clarifications that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Richards had provided. This is, however, an example of substantive information about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the bid being communicated by Mr Smith in a very informal manner and without keeping a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">formal record. The e mail recorded in material part that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref414" href="#footnote414">414</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;[Jeremy Hunt/Adam Smith] saw Ed Richards today:</span>







 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he challenged Ed on the &#8220;may be&#8221; rationale. Ed was adamant that the threshold was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">very low and referral was the only option</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">-he also challenged him on &#8220;sufficiency of plurality</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">-ed repeated the same concerns which are in the report</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">-he didn&#8217;t raise remedies with Ed.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">and Mr Smith&#8217;s evidence about this was:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref415" href="#footnote415">415</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. That may be right, but at least you&#8217;re providing confirmation of what Mr Hunt</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">told Mr Richards, and you&#8217;re also providing fresh information as to what Mr Richards&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">position was because you see the sentence:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Ed was adamant that the threshold was very low ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">That, in fact, is correct, as a matter of law.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">... and referral was the only option.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">That would be a matter of opinion. But unless you told Mr Michel that, he wouldn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know that, would he?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Well, I would have been confirming what Mr Hunt had said, but in the meeting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that Mr Hunt had with Ofcom, the minutes of that meeting show that he wanted to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">share Mr Richards&#8217; answers to those questions with News Corporation.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">Q. Mm.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. So, in this sense, that&#8217;s what I was doing.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-157"><a href="#para5-157" name="para5-157">5.157</a></p>
 The same email containsa typical example of the sort of report which Mr Smith frequently
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disputed. Mr Michel had gone on to write &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> He</span><span style="font-style:italic"> made</span><span style="font-style:italic"> again</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> plea</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> try</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> find</span><span style="font-style:italic"> as</span><span style="font-style:italic"> many</span><span style="font-style:italic"> legal</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">is not necessary to resolve these disputes on a case by case basis, although I am satisfied that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel did on many occasions use hyperbole when reporting his conversations with Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Smith and was prone, on occasion to inaccuracy.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-158"><a href="#para5-158" name="para5-158">5.158</a></p>
 Mr Michel&#8217;s</span> email report ofa telephone conversation with Mr Smith on<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 23</span> January<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contains numerous examples of Mr Michel&#8217;s use of the language of common cause and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conspiracy, albeit in this case Mr Smith did not believe that he said what Mr Michel attributes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to him. Whatever Mr Smith actually said, the terms in which it was reported demonstrate Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Michel&#8217;s propensity to record matters in these terms. The report concerned the UIL and News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Corp&#8217;s concerns about publication of Ofcom&#8217;s report. It contains the phrases:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref416" href="#footnote416">416</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;His view is that once he announces publicly he has a strong UIL, it&#8217;s almost game</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">over for the opposition .</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He understands fully our concerns/fears regarding the publication of the report and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the consultation of Ofcom in the process; but he wants us to take the heat, with him,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the next 2 weeks.</span>


 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He very specifically said that he was keen to get to the same outcome and wanted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">JRM to understand he needs to build some political cover on the process. &#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span></span>

 The startling opening to Mr Michel&#8217;s email report ofa conversation with Mr Smith to James

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Hunt announced that he was minded to refer the bid but was going to take advice on News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Corp&#8217;s UIL. In fact communicating this information was not, in itself, illegal but the report</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does, put at its lowest, convey a sense that information was surreptitiously being provided.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">shortly after Mr Hunt&#8217;s press statement about the bid had been released. He complained,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">its face it is conspiratorial and appears to betray Mr Hunt&#8217;s thinking as being that the UIL were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very strong but he did not want to be seen to be saying as much. That is an interpretation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which would be consistent with the terms of Mr Michel&#8217;s email of 23 January 2011, discussed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">above. Mr Smith gave a different explanation for his use of this language, claiming that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was being disingenuous to mollify Mr Michel:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref420" href="#footnote420">420</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think by this stage, Mr Michel had got quite cross that Mr Hunt&#8217;s statement didn&#8217;t,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as he had been asking for and pushing for previously &#8211; you will call the UILs strong</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or brilliant or, you know, some sort of description like that, and the first part of my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">text was a bit of a &#8211; the potential to mitigate problems bit was paraphrasing what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mr Hunt&#8217;s statement had said that had gone out slightly earlier that morning, was an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">attempt by me to say there is support for the UIL. I mean, if you read what Mr Hunt</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">said, I mean it didn&#8217;t support the UIL, so my attempt there was quite sort of shaky</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ground, if you like.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Then, the other part was too flippant and jokey, I admit that.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. The position is that Ofcom was recommending a referral to the CC. The UILs had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been published or &#8211; at least published internally on 20 January and this was the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">remedy which would prevent the referral to the CC if they were strong enough, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the departmental view, apparently, was that the UILs were solid, were good &#8211; indeed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it was your term, &#8220;brilliant&#8221;, but you couldn&#8217;t say they were brilliant, otherwise that</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would undermine the process and, what&#8217;s more, as you rightly pointed out, people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would ask for them to be published. Don&#8217;t you accept that that&#8217;s the only reasonable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interpretation?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. That was an attempt by me to pacify and mollify by being slightly disingenuous. If</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you read what Mr Hunt had said, he didn&#8217;t say they were brilliant.&#8221;</span>




 <p id="para-id-5-161"><a href="#para5-161" name="para5-161">5.161</a></p>
 Mr Smith&#8217;s</span> explanation shows some vulnerability to Mr<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Michel&#8217;s</span> modus<span style="font-weight:normal;"> operandi, preferring
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to enter into the conspiratorial dialogue rather than provide an alternative and more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate reply. Mr Michel&#8217;s response was to keep pushing. After the Parliamentary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statement at 09:30hrs that morning he texted: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Still.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> All</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> language</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> statutory.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> understand</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the constraints but there is nothing in the statement which gives us comfort or send [sic]</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">signals that remedy is strong one.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref421" href="#footnote421">421</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Smith</span><span style="font-style:normal"> replied:</span><span style="font-style:normal"> &#8220;</span> Other than what Jeremy and I have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">told you! We have no legal wriggle room in a statement to parliament.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref422" href="#footnote422">422</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> That</span><span style="font-style:normal"> reply</span><span style="font-style:normal"> prompts</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the question: what had the Secretary of State and Mr Smith told Mr Michel? Mr Smith said</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he was referring only to what Mr Hunt had told them on 20 January and what he had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reiterated of that.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref423" href="#footnote423">423</a></sup> He described his text as another example of him trying to get Mr Michel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">off his back.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-162"><a href="#para5-162" name="para5-162">5.162</a></p>
 By this stage Mr Smith was already far too close to Mr Michel and their communications
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were unacceptable in the context of his principal making a quasi-judicial decision. Despite his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evident discomfort, Mr Smith explained why he did not call a halt to the exchanges. He felt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it was his job to remain as the point of contact:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref424" href="#footnote424">424</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. One strategy you might have used by this point is simply to turn off your mobile</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">phone, frankly. Weren&#8217;t you reaching the point that this was getting much too close</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">now, to this man?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I don&#8217;t think that I would have been doing the job that I had assumed in terms</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of being a point of contact with News Corporation if I&#8217;d stopped being the point of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contact with them. I mean, in hindsight I would have maybe liked to have at some</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">stages to have had a break from it, yes.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-163"><a href="#para5-163" name="para5-163">5.163</a></p>
 It is regrettable that Mr Smith did not take what should have appeared as an obvious step,
<span style="font-size: 15px;">namely to seek the advice of the Permanent Secretary or Mr Hunt either at this stage or,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indeed, at any stage of the process about Mr Michel&#8217;s communications and how he should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deal with them. In not doing so, he made an error of judgment. Even allowing for his lack of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">experience, the lack of specific instruction, and the perceived need to provide procedural</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reassurance to News Corp, he ought still to have realised that the volume, tone and content</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Mr Michel&#8217;s emails was an issue to be raised with others. Continuing the dialogue and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seeking to appease Mr Michel was a mistake.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-164"><a href="#para5-164" name="para5-164">5.164</a></p>
 There were further text exchanges on 25</span> January<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011</span> culminating, at<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 22:26hrs in an example
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Mr Michel&#8217;s use of the language of common cause: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> think</span><span style="font-style:italic"> we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> re</span><span style="font-style:italic"> [sic]</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> good</span><span style="font-style:italic"> place</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">morning though!&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref426" href="#footnote426">426</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-165"><a href="#para5-165" name="para5-165">5.165</a></p>
 On 4</span> February<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011,</span> Mr Smith senta text message which he admitted looked<span style="font-weight:normal;"> surreptitious.
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel had asked for sight of the documents submitted by Enders and by Slaughter &</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">May. Mr Smith replied:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> haven&#8217;t</span><span style="font-style:italic"> actually</span><span style="font-style:italic"> got</span><span style="font-style:italic"> them</span><span style="font-style:italic"> at</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> moment.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Officials</span><span style="font-style:italic"> just</span><span style="font-style:italic"> told</span><span style="font-style:italic"> me</span></span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">questioned about his choice of words, he accepted that it looked surreptitious, whilst denying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that anything surreptitious actually happened:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref427" href="#footnote427">427</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. One possible inference is that you were going to do something a little bit</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">surreptitious. Would you accept that?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I do accept that it looks like that way, yes, but I don&#8217;t believe anything like that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">happened.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-5-166"><a href="#para5-166" name="para5-166">5.166</a></p>
 Five days later,</span> on<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 9</span> February<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011,</span> Mr Smith joked with Mr Michel in partisan<span style="font-weight:normal;"> terms. Mr
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Michel informed Mr Smith that he was to see Lord Black, an opponent of the bid: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Am</span><span style="font-style:italic"> seeing</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Guy Black Monday evening. Interesting. James in London until Friday if needed. He is then off</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to New York next week. Fred<span style="font-style:normal"> .&#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref428" href="#footnote428">428</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Smith</span><span style="font-style:normal"> replied:</span><span style="font-style:normal"> &#8220;</span> Take your stab proof vest with you!

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Smith did not seek to defend the comment: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> ...I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> wouldn&#8217;t</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> used</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> language</span><span style="font-style:italic"> again,</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the course of communications as a whole, it also exemplifies the inherent dangers of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">using a medium of communication as informal as text messaging in the course of the formal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">process of which, although not the decision maker, he was a part.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-167"><a href="#para5-167" name="para5-167">5.167</a></p>
 Relevant to the question of the appearance of bias, Mr Smith accepted that the accumulation
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of text messages gave rise at least to the perception that he was on side with Mr Michel. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was put this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref431" href="#footnote431">431</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. It&#8217;s just the accumulation of text messages, which arguably give rise to am</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">impression. One can&#8217;t identify one particular message and say, &#8220;Aha, this means X</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rather than Y&#8221;, it&#8217;s just the series of them. Do you accept that they are giving rise at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">least to the perception that you were on side with Mr Michel?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I can see how that perception would be created, yes &#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-168"><a href="#para5-168" name="para5-168">5.168</a></p>
 Despite the cumulative effect of very many emails which prompted Mr Smith&#8217;s realistic
<span style="font-size: 15px;">admission, the course of the dialogue was by no means one way. In particular, there are a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of issues on which Mr Michel pushed really quite hard for an outcome which he did</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not get. For example, these included efforts to persuade Mr Smith to persuade Mr Hunt to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dismiss Ofcom&#8217;s views. On 9 February 2011, Mr Michel related a conversation with Mr Smith</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref432" href="#footnote432">432</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I told him he had to stand for something ultimately and this was his chance to dismiss</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Ofcom&#8217;s views and show he had some backbone, he said he couldn&#8217;t ignore Ofcom,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he had brought them into this OFT process to get some cover and in public debate, he</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would get absolutely killed if he did such a thing.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-169"><a href="#para5-169" name="para5-169">5.169</a></p>
 Mr Smith said of this:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref433" href="#footnote433">433</a></sup>







 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t actually remember him saying those sorts of specific words, but I do</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know that they were constantly pushing for the Department to essentially ignore</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">Ofcom.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-170"><a href="#para5-170" name="para5-170">5.170</a></p>
 News Corp&#8217;s</span> constant pushing, through Mr Michel and through more formal<span style="font-weight:normal;"> channels, got it
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nowhere. Mr Hunt resolutely maintained his reliance upon the regulator&#8217;s advice. Similarly,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when News Corp described Ofcom&#8217;s advice that the hived off Sky News should have an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent chairman, Mr Michel told Mr Smith that it was a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> deal</span><span style="font-style:italic"> stopper</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref434" href="#footnote434">434</a></sup> That act of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">brinksmanship did not prevent Mr Hunt from writing to News Corp on 15 February 2011 and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">giving the company just 24 hours to agree in principle to that and other recommendations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that had been made by Ofcom.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref435" href="#footnote435">435</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-171"><a href="#para5-171" name="para5-171">5.171</a></p>
 It is worthy of mention that Mr Michel&#8217;s</span> exchanges with Mr Smith about<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Ofcom&#8217;s advice at
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this stage of the process involved premature disclosure by Mr Michel to Mr Smith of a letter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">written by Ofcom to News Corp, a fact that was reflected in typically conspiratorial terms by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel to James Murdoch:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref436" href="#footnote436">436</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8211;he can&#8217;t instruct his officials to get back to Ofcom as he is not supposed to be aware</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that we have received the letter and its content ...so we have to be very careful on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">this.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-172"><a href="#para5-172" name="para5-172">5.172</a></p>
 On 11</span> February<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011,</span> Mr Michel, who was waiting for<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Ofcom&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> report, senta text to Mr Smith
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at 21:26hrs. It was one of a number that day. He wrote: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Thanks</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Adam.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Hope</span><span style="font-style:italic"> you</span><span style="font-style:italic"> get</span><span style="font-style:italic"> home</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">language that might equally have come from News Corp. The exchange went as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref438" href="#footnote438">438</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. The point of the email below is that there were &#8211; I think it was on the radio,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wasn&#8217;t it? Yes. An individual from Enders&#8217; analysis had been saying that there were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">possible remedies that could deal with the Ofcom concerns and, of course, by this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">point News Corporation had written to Mr Hunt to concede on the points that Ofcom</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the OFT had asked to be in the UILs, so the point there was that, if people that had</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">previously been opposed to the undertakings in lieu were now saying that there may</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be undertakings in lieu, that could work and that News Corporation had conceded on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the issues that Ofcom and the OFT had wanted in there, then there was every reason</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for the department and Mr Hunt to be confident about those undertakings in lieu.</span>





 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. You&#8217;re almost communicating there a public relations message, and coming close</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to putting yourself in the same boat as News Corp by using the pronoun &#8220;we&#8221;. Do you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">accept that?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. &#8220;We&#8221; would have been &#8220;we&#8221; the collective department I wouldn&#8217;t have put &#8220;I&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">because I obviously wouldn&#8217;t have been saying anything publicly.&#8221;</span>

 Comparison of Mr Smith&#8217;s</span> text messages to Mr Michel on<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 24</span> February<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011</span> with Mr<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Michel&#8217;s

 At 10:50hrs, Mr Michel emailed James Murdoch in terms which communicated what Mr
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Smith had texted but then added a further sentence:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref442" href="#footnote442">442</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;JH just texted that he can&#8217;t interfere with the process but can give us more time to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sort things out. He can&#8217;t engage substance whilst Ofcom is working with us. He can</span>

 Typical of Mr Michel&#8217;s</span> familiarity and use of flattery wasa text exchange on<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 3</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> March, at
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the culmination of an intense period of activity leading up to the Secretary of State&#8217;s oral</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statement to Parliament announcing the first public consultation about which Mr Michel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">texted: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Jeremy</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> superb&#8221;</span> .

 The flattery was later augmented by an offer to socialise.</span> On<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 5</span> April<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011,</span> Mr Michel<span style="font-weight:normal;"> texted:
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Would</span><span style="font-style:italic"> you</span><span style="font-style:italic"> both</span><span style="font-style:italic"> like</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> join</span><span style="font-style:italic"> me</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> [my</span><span style="font-style:italic"> wife]</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Take</span><span style="font-style:italic"> That</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> 4</span><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 9px;"> th</span><span style="font-style:italic"> July</span><span style="font-style:italic"> at</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Wembley?</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Fred</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref444" href="#footnote444">444</a></sup></span>

 The text which Mr Smith most regretted sending was dated 2</span> June<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011. On its face it
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appears to show that he and Mr Michel had become so close that they were almost working</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">together. Mr Smith said that in fact it was another attempt to mollify Mr Michel and was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantively true. The text read:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref445" href="#footnote445">445</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Over the last few days I have been causing a lot of chaos and moaning from people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">here on your behalf. I should have an update later today&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>








 <p id="para-id-5-180"><a href="#para5-180" name="para5-180">5.180</a></p>
 Mr Smith&#8217;s</span> explanation was in these<span style="font-weight:normal;"> terms:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref446" href="#footnote446">446</a></sup>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. This is the one that I do regret the most. By this stage I was probably coming</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">toward the end of my tether, as it were, and I sent him a text to get him off my back,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but I certainly don&#8217;t think anybody in the department would have said that that&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what I&#8217;d been doing, and I certainly wasn&#8217;t doing anything on their behalf, but in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hindsight I shouldn&#8217;t have sent it, but it was an attempt to mollify him.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Either to mollify or to indicate assent to the proposition, I suppose, there&#8217;s a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">degree of collusion here between you, that you&#8217;ve become so close that you were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">almost working together. Do you feel that that&#8217;s a reasonable inference or not?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I can see how people would think that, but I sent it to mollify him and get him off</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my back, not to do as you&#8217;ve just suggested.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-181"><a href="#para5-181" name="para5-181">5.181</a></p>
 On 27</span> June<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011,</span> Mr Michel sent Mrs Brooks an email purporting to communicate Mr<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Hunt&#8217;s
<span style="font-size: 15px;">views about how the Government should respond to the unfolding phone hacking issue. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">read:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref447" href="#footnote447">447</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Hunt will be making references to phone-hacking in his statement on Rubicon this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">week.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He will be repeating the same narrative as the one he gave in Parliament few weeks</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ago [sic].</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">This is based on his belief that the police is pursuing things thoroughly and phone-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hacking has nothing to do with the media plurality issue.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">[It&#8217;s] extremely helpful.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">On the issue of the Privacy Committee, he supports a widening of its remit to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">future of the press and evidence from all newspaper groups on the regulatory regime.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He wants to prevent a public enquiry [sic]. For this, the Committee will need to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">come up with a strong report in the Autumn and put enough pressure on the PCC to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">strengthen itself and take recommendations forward.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">JH is now starting to look into phone-hacking / practices more thoroughly and has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">asked me to advise him privately in the coming weeks and guide his and [No10&#8217;s]</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">positioning...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-182"><a href="#para5-182" name="para5-182">5.182</a></p>
 When asked about this email Mr Smith accepted that he might have asked Mr Michel to be
<span style="font-size: 15px;">kept informed about News Corp&#8217;s reaction to the phone hacking scandal but denied that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">asked to be guided. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref448" href="#footnote448">448</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. Yes, certainly. If this was a conversation with me, it&#8217;s quite possible that I asked</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">him to let me know what steps News International was taking in response to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">phone hacking situation, mainly because the department is obviously responsible for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the media sector, so that would be interesting, but I would never have asked to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">guided, and I think this use of the word &#8220;privately&#8221; again is one that I don&#8217;t really sort</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of recognise because if I&#8217;d asked him to send me statements they were making about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">phone hacking, then he would have sent them to me. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s privately.&#8221;</span>



 <p id="para-id-5-183"><a href="#para5-183" name="para5-183">5.183</a></p>
 For her part,</span> Mrs<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Brooks&#8217; reaction was simply to ask for confirmation as to when Mr Hunt
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be making his statement.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref449" href="#footnote449">449</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-184"><a href="#para5-184" name="para5-184">5.184</a></p>
 On 30</span> June<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011, the day on which Mr Hunt announced that he was minded to accept
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the revised UIL, subject to a second short consultation, Mr Michel combined flattery, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the narrative of common cause in little more than a line. His text read: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Just</span><span style="font-style:italic"> showed</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Rupert. Great statement by the way. We need to knock Avaaz down. They are all about US</span>

<p id="para-id-5-185"><a href="#para5-185" name="para5-185">5.185</a></p>
 By 7</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011,</span> publicity about the phone hacking scandal was reachinga<span style="font-weight:normal;"> crescendo. Mr Smith
<span style="font-size: 15px;">called Mr Michel at 17:35hrs and had a conversation lasting 11 minutes and 8 seconds.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref451" href="#footnote451">451</a></sup> At</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">18:01hrs, Mr Michel emailed James Murdoch and others at News Corp with a report relating</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the bid.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref452" href="#footnote452">452</a></sup> The subject line read: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> JH</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8211;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> CONFIDENTIAL</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8211;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> please</span><span style="font-style:italic"> read</span> &#8221;. The first bullet point</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contains information about the Government&#8217;s then current thinking about inquiries into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">phone hacking. This was material that was not in the public domain. Under the subheading</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Latest on Rubicon&#8221; (News Corp&#8217;s code name for the bid) it read:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref453" href="#footnote453">453</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;-Was not discussed at the No10 meeting that Hunt had with the PM &#8211; was discussing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the two enquiries [&#8220;police&#8221; one led by a judge; and &#8220;media practices&#8221; one not with a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">judge and led by DCMS]&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-186"><a href="#para5-186" name="para5-186">5.186</a></p>
 Mr Smith accepted that it was possible that he was the source of this information but did not
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accept that it was probable that he did so. The exchange with Counsel to the Inquiry on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">point was as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref454" href="#footnote454">454</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. There is reference to two possible public inquiries, which, at that stage, we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">believe does represent government thinking on 7 July. The suggestion is that the only</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">source for this information could have been you, and it ties in with what we know to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be a fact, namely the telephone call half an hour earlier. Would you agree that or not?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I&#8217;m not sure that I would necessarily be the only source of that information. I can&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">remember, at that stage, whether I knew that that was the case. I may well have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">done.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. You may well have done?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes, I may well have done but I can&#8217;t remember whether I did, but I think most of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the discussions were &#8211; most of those conversations were being dealt with by Number</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">10 but I don&#8217;t know &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. This wasn&#8217;t in the public domain as yet, Mr Smith. I think the simple point I&#8217;m</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">making, and it may be more a matter for inference, if you knew the facts set out in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the first bullet point, if you accept that there was a conversation within half an hour</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of this email, one possible inference, it may be a reasonable inference, is that you&#8217;re</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the source of the information we see in the email. Would you agree with that?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I would agree that that is a possible inference, yes.</span>






 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Probable inference?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Possible.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Unless there was someone else providing this information ahead of the game,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you&#8217;re the only person we can possibly look at for these purposes, I think. Would you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">accept that?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I don&#8217;t know who else &#8211; I mean lots of other people would presumably have known</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">only far more than I would have done by this stage because &#8211; but I don&#8217;t know who &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Pretty confidential, I would have thought at this point, what government thinking</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was. It would have been known about, obviously within Number 10, the Cabinet</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Office, people high up in DCMS and something that you knew about because Mr Hunt</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">might have shared it with you. Is that fair?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I don&#8217;t know that I did know about it, but he may well have shared it, yes, but I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">don&#8217;t remember at this stage.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Had he shared this information with you, do you accept that it&#8217;s information</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which, I&#8217;m not saying that you did impart it to Mr Michel, but you shouldn&#8217;t have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">imparted it to Mr Michel?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes, I would say so, yes.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Which may explain why you&#8217;re hesitant to agree with me that you did impart it to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A. Well &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. &#8211; that would be natural, wouldn&#8217;t it?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. &#8211; I don&#8217;t remember imparting it, mainly because I don&#8217;t quite know that I knew it,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which would make it quite strange for me to be able to impart it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-187"><a href="#para5-187" name="para5-187">5.187</a></p>
 The very close temporal link between the telephone conversation and Mr Michel&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> email, the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fact that Mr Michel was obviously reporting in his email about the telephone conversation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Mr Smith, the reference to Mr Hunt and the complete absence of evidence that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Michel was communicating with anyone else about these matters, all lead me to infer that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is not merely possible but probable that it was Mr Smith who had provided confidential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information about Government thinking as to the appropriate form of inquiries arising from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the phone hacking scandal. The rapid leak of confidential Government thinking to the parent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">company of the entity at the heart of the scandal is undeniably a matter of concern.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-188"><a href="#para5-188" name="para5-188">5.188</a></p>
 Both Mr Hunt and Mr Stephens knew that Mr Smith was in contact with News Corp. Mr

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Stephens was aware that Mr Smith was attending formal meetings and<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> occasion</span><span style="font-style:italic"> following</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">name or job title but he did assume that Mr Smith was in contact with someone with access</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to News Corp&#8217;s Chief Executive. He thought that the purpose of Mr Smith&#8217;s contact was:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref456" href="#footnote456">456</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;To follow up on matters of process and procedure, to reinforce, on occasions,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">messages that the Secretary of State had delivered personally or in correspondence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to News Corporation.&#8221;</span>


 <p id="para-id-5-189"><a href="#para5-189" name="para5-189">5.189</a></p>
 Mr Stephens did not become aware of the full nature or extent of the contact,</span> or,<span style="font-weight:normal;"> indeed, that
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it had in any way been inappropriate until 24 April 2012.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref457" href="#footnote457">457</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-190"><a href="#para5-190" name="para5-190">5.190</a></p>
 Mr Hunt described Mr Smith&#8217;s</span> role<span style="font-weight:normal;"> as:</span><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 9px;"> 458
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;a point of contact, an official point of contact in the process, so that News Corp has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">someone that they could call if they had concerns about the process, and someone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who was there to &#8211; you know, I mean the situation in which we inherited responsibility</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for a bid was one in which News Corp felt they had not been fairly treated, and so</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I wanted to make sure that there was someone there who could answer questions</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about how the process was going in a helpful way&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-191"><a href="#para5-191" name="para5-191">5.191</a></p>
 As well as being aware of Mr Smith&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> role, there were occasions during the process on which
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Smith reported back to Mr Hunt about particular aspects of the contact which thought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were worthy of his attention. When asked whether he had specifically used Mr Michel&#8217;s name</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in discussions with Mr Hunt, Mr Smith said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref459" href="#footnote459">459</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I can&#8217;t remember whether I specifically did but I would have thought, on the odd</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">occasion that I did mention to Mr Hunt, on one of the issues that I thought was worthy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of his attention, I would, I think, almost certainly have said, &#8220;Fred&#8217;s told me X,Y or Z.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-192"><a href="#para5-192" name="para5-192">5.192</a></p>
 Nevertheless, Mr Hunt expressed his shock at discovering the true extent of the contact in
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his evidence:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref460" href="#footnote460">460</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. I suppose it might be said that the greater the volume of contact, arguably the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more extraordinary the contact, the more likely it is that he&#8217;d communicated the fact</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that there had been such an amount of contact with you. Are you sure that he didn&#8217;t,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">Mr Hunt?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. He didn&#8217;t, and I was totally shocked when I discovered the level of that contact. I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think it does explain why sometimes he slipped into inappropriate language.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-193"><a href="#para5-193" name="para5-193">5.193</a></p>
I must admit to finding it surprising that Mr Smith, who had worked for Mr Hunt so closely
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and for so long should have kept him unsighted on the way in which he was performing what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he saw to be his duty; that, as I understood it, was the role of a SpAd &#8211; to be the &#8216;eyes and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ears&#8217; of his principal. Both men, however, make it clear that Mr Hunt was unaware of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nature, and extent of his contact with Mr Michel. Mr Smith explains the position on the basis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that his role as a buffer was specifically to protect his principal from the barrage to which he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been subjected. In the circumstances, I accept what I have been told.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-194"><a href="#para5-194" name="para5-194">5.194</a></p>
 There were officials and lawyers within DCMS who knew that Mr Smith was in contact with
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel. The evidence about that contact did not suggest that they were aware of the full</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">nature and extent of the contact that was actually taking place. However, it did confirm that</span>




 <span style="font-size: 15px;">no one suggested to Mr Smith that he ought not to be communicating with Mr Michel. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Smith said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref461" href="#footnote461">461</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I suppose what I would say is that they generally knew I was in touch. On some</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">certain issues they certainly knew, but I don&#8217;t think they knew the volume or extent.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">and:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref462" href="#footnote462">462</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...I think as the process went on with discussions I had with members of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">department or emails I sent them, they would have very clearly been aware and knew</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that I was having those discussions with Mr Michel, and nobody ever said, you know,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">where did you hear this or you shouldn&#8217;t be doing that or &#8211; it was &#8211; I assumed that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was the role I was going to be taking, and then as it developed, I don&#8217;t think anybody</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was surprised that that was the role.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-195"><a href="#para5-195" name="para5-195">5.195</a></p>
 There were naturallya number of lawyers and officials who were in communication with News
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Corp about the bid. Jon eff, who was the lead official for the DCMS on the bid, exchanged text</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">messages with Mr Michel. This text contact is deserving of mention because of the contrast</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between it and that which passed between Mr Michel and Mr Smith. There were far fewer in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number, only 23 in the period 20 January 2011 to 13 July 2011. They are typically very short,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the point, and limited to matters concerning the actual execution of the process.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref463" href="#footnote463">463</a></sup></span>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-196"><a href="#para5-196" name="para5-196">5.196</a></p>
 In some respects,</span> there was much to commend in Mr<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Hunt&#8217;s</span> handling of the<span style="font-weight:normal;"> bid. It is
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undeniable that he had views about News Corp and its place in UK media operations: these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were views that he was entitled to hold given his portfolio responsibilities. He appreciated,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">however, the need to restore confidence after Dr Cable&#8217;s damaging utterances and showed a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">determination to put aside these views and to follow a fair and rigorous procedural route to a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">final decision. At the formal level there was a high level of transparency. Mr Hunt&#8217;s extensive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reliance on external advice, above and beyond the minimum required, was a very wise and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effective means of helping him to keep to the statutory test and to engender the confidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of those opposed to the transaction that an objective decision would be taken. There is a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">danger if the decision maker accepts and follows advice too slavishly. If that is done then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discretion is fettered. Mr Hunt avoided that risk, as was evidenced by the way in which he</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">probed Ofcom&#8217;s advice.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-197"><a href="#para5-197" name="para5-197">5.197</a></p>
 All the effort and good work which was done on the bid was put in jeopardy bya serious
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hidden problem. Had Mr Hunt accepted News Corp&#8217;s UIL, and had there been a challenge to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">that decision by way of an application for judicial review, seeking to impugn the procedural</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fairness of the decision (a course which had in fact been the subject of thinly veiled threat</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by Slaughter and May at an early stage) then there would have been an obligation on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State to disclose all relevant documents evidencing contact between News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Corp and him and his officials, including that of his SpAds, relating to the bid. The effect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of those documents, particularly the communications between Mr Michel and Mr Smith,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would undoubtedly have been to give rise to a powerful argument that there was at least</span>



 <span style="font-size: 15px;">the appearance of bias in the process and therefore the risk of a successful claim for judicial</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">review.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-198"><a href="#para5-198" name="para5-198">5.198</a></p>
 In reaching this view,</span>I should make clear thatI am doing so on the merits of the<span style="font-weight:normal;"> matter.I fully
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognise that the practical risk of a judicial review in relation to this &#8216;serious hidden problem&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was, almost by definition, low. Those who might have brought such a challenge would have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been unaware of the basis they had for doing so. Even had the risk eventuated the chance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a punctilious search within the Department for all potentially relevant material yielding these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular documents were not high either. The majority of the relevant material disclosed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry was provided from the records of News Corp. But none of this is to the point; the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantive legal and ethical issues remain, the hidden problem was there, and it might not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have remained for ever concealed. The disclosure of these documents as KRM18 during the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry process shows that events can take an unpredictable course.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-199"><a href="#para5-199" name="para5-199">5.199</a></p>
 There is one further observationI make about this. To the extent that the practical risk of
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an application for judicial review might have been assessed as low precisely because the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appearance of bias would not have been apparent in departmental records, there are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">additional reasons to express concern about the hidden problem of voluminous &#8216;private&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(unrecorded) communications by text and email. In quasi-judicial procedures, there is no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">place for any argument that relevant conduct, as all of these communications certainly were,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is somehow rendered any less relevant because it is informal, unrecorded, and contains some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mixture of the personal, the political or the presentational.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-200"><a href="#para5-200" name="para5-200">5.200</a></p>
I well understand the distinctions that have to be made from the point of view of Government
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accountabilities between the conduct of SpAds (and, indeed, Ministers) on Government</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">business and on party-political or personal business. But these are distinctions which have to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">correspond to the substance of a communication or other course of conduct, not its manner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and form. Government business does not cease to have that character simply because it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transacted out of hours on a personal phone and includes private pleasantries. And where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">quasi-judicial decision making is concerned, all relevant actions and communications by a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision maker or those acting with his or her actual or apparent authority are, in reality,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government business.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-201"><a href="#para5-201" name="para5-201">5.201</a></p>
 Among all the excesses of Mr Michel&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> correspondence, perhaps the message with some
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the most concerning wider implications was his advice to his principal not to meet with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the decision maker on the grounds of counter-productivity, but advising in terms that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> could</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> chat</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span><span style="font-style:italic"> him</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> his</span><span style="font-style:italic"> mobile</span><span style="font-style:italic"> which</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> completely</span><span style="font-style:italic"> fine</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> will</span><span style="font-style:italic"> liaise</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span><span style="font-style:italic"> his</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">record&#8217; and &#8216;personal&#8217; is seen as an obvious and effective means of conducting lobbying on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matters of media policy is symptomatic of a problem evidenced more widely to the Inquiry;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the fact that such practices have a side-effect (I say no more than that) of placing the conduct</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of public policy issues outside the mechanisms of transparency, accountability and public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">record cannot but give rise to perceptions and questions which are corrosive to public trust</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and confidence. I underline this point because it is in this respect that I consider the conduct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the BSkyB bid to have important characteristics, as part of a much wider issue about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship between the politicians and the press, which I consider in some detail in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusions I draw at the end of this Part of the Report.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-202"><a href="#para5-202" name="para5-202">5.202</a></p>
 It is right to recognise that the bid came to Mr Hunt and DCMS ina crisis not of their making.
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That it did so made Mr Hunt&#8217;s task all the more difficult. Even so, examination of the course</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">of the bid shows that the seeds of the problem which was to emerge were sown at an early</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stage. The process that was put into place did not prove to be robust enough. Best practice of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the kind subsequently encapsulated in the Cabinet Office guidance was not followed. There</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was no written guidance for Mr Smith and others as to the conduct expected of them in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">quasi-judicial environment. Mr Stephens, no doubt, genuinely believed that the requirements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the principle had been made crystal clear in the various meetings that he described, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to him as a very experienced and senior civil servant, they may indeed have been.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-203"><a href="#para5-203" name="para5-203">5.203</a></p>
 Evidently,</span> however, at the level of practical<span style="font-weight:normal;"> detail, these requirements and the underlying
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasons for them were not made clear enough for Mr Smith, or even, albeit to a much lesser</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extent, for Mr Hunt. For reasons already discussed above, the use of a SpAd as a point of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contact for News Corp gave rise to risks which could easily have been avoided by entrusting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the task to an official: the decision to allocate the role to a SpAd was, in my judgment, unwise.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That is not because of any question about his integrity or calibre, but because he had a pre-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">existing and amicable relationship with Mr Michel, which Mr Michel was able to exploit to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">engineer contact that was inappropriate in volume and in some cases in tone. Mr Michel was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also able to trade on the fact that Mr Smith would want that relationship to continue after</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the bid was concluded. When faced with the intimacy, charm, volume and persistence of Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Michel&#8217;s approaches, Mr Smith was put in an extremely difficult position.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-204"><a href="#para5-204" name="para5-204">5.204</a></p>
 That wasa risk which was,</span> or should have been, obvious from the<span style="font-weight:normal;"> outset. The consequential
<span style="font-size: 15px;">risks were then compounded by the cumulative effects of the lack of explicit clarity in Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Smith&#8217;s role, the lack of sufficient express instruction that it was clear he fully understood, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a lack of supervision. They are all matters for which Mr Hunt was responsible, although they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might have been prevented had Mr Hunt fully appreciated the extent to which meticulous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attention had to be paid to every aspect of the conduct of quasi-judicial procedure. Given that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this was the problem that had faced Dr Cable, Mr Hunt was very aware of his own position.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-205"><a href="#para5-205" name="para5-205">5.205</a></p>
 IrrespectiveoftheextenttowhichNewsCorpmighthavebeenentitledtofeelaggrievedbythe
<span style="font-size: 15px;">comments of Dr Cable, the bid was now in different hands and its consideration started afresh.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both from the perspectives of Mr Hunt as decision-taker and Mr Stephens&#8217; responsibilities</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for advising him and for the overall conduct of the bid process, it was essential that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">precise limits of what was acceptable (and, just as important, what was not acceptable)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were fully understood by all who might have contact with News Corp or its executives: that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">most certainly included anyone in the position of Mr Michel. Unfortunately, both Mr Hunt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Mr Stephens appear to have overestimated Mr Smith&#8217;s detailed comprehension of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requirements and limits of his role, and his capacity to put them into practice unsupported;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their overconfidence in him appears, ironically, to have its roots in the excellence which Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Smith had demonstrated in his more usual duties. For Mr Hunt, this was an issue of the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">tasking and management of his SpAd; for Mr Stephens, it was an issue that could create risks</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for conduct of the bid.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-206"><a href="#para5-206" name="para5-206">5.206</a></p>
 There is much to say by way of mitigation for Mr Smith.</span> He was<span style="font-weight:normal;"> inexperienced, had been
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involved in Government for a matter of months and had never before been involved in (even</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if he had ever heard about) a quasi-judicial process. He did not receive what was to be, for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">him, sufficiently clear or detailed guidance because, although he heard what Mr Hunt and Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Stephens heard and, I have no doubt, wanted to further the proper discharge of his principal&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">duties, he did not appreciate the limitations; neither was he appropriately supervised. On the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one hand, he behaved as if his role was to act as &#8216;eyes and ears&#8217; which meant keeping Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Hunt informed of what was happening; on the other hand, he was a &#8216;buffer&#8217;, there to provide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a measure of protection. Trying to reconcile these roles, he effectively behaved as he would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on any other matter while operating in the political environment with which he was familiar.</span>
 <p id="para-id-5-207"><a href="#para5-207" name="para5-207">5.207</a></p>
 Mr Smith was diligent,</span> literally toa fault on this<span style="font-weight:normal;"> occasion, and undoubtedly had discharged his
<span style="font-size: 15px;">duties in an exemplary manner before having to deal with the bid. Despite all that can be said</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on his behalf, he ought nevertheless to have realised that Mr Michel was pushing his way too</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">far into the process, by over-familiar means, and that action was required to address that. It is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regrettable that he did not seek advice from either Mr Hunt or Mr Stephens, or alternatively</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">take action himself to put the communications onto a proper footing. Instead, he succumbed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Mr Michel&#8217;s intimate, surreptitious and conspiratorial language and got &#8216;way too close&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to him, ultimately, as I have concluded, probably passing on confidential information about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government thinking which should never have been imparted to News Corp.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-208"><a href="#para5-208" name="para5-208">5.208</a></p>
 The perception of bias emerges from the exchanges between Mr Smith and Mr Michel. What
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not evident from the close consideration of events which the Inquiry undertook was any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">credible evidence of actual bias on the part of Mr Hunt. Whatever he had said, both publicly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and in private, about News Corp or the Murdochs, as soon as he was given the responsibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for dealing with the bid the evidence demonstrates a real desire on his part to get it right. His</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">actions as a decision maker were frequently adverse to News Corp&#8217;s interests. He showed a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">willingness to follow Ofcom&#8217;s advice and to take action, to the extent recommended by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulators, in response to the consultation. Even had the deal been approved, it is abundantly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear, that it would only have been permitted to proceed subject to very significant and closely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scrutinised UIL.</span>

<h2>6. News Corp and the Rt Hon Alex Salmond MSP</h2>

<p id="para-id-6-1"><a href="#para6-1" name="para6-1">6.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The lobbying of Adam Smith was not the only way in which Mr Michel hoped to influence Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Hunt. One of the conduits which Mr Michel sought to exploit calls for examination. Its roots</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lay in the period before Mr Hunt took over responsibility for the bid.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-2"><a href="#para6-2" name="para6-2">6.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">During the autumn of 2010, Mr Michel had been in touch with the First Minister for Scotland,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Rt Hon Alex Salmond MSP. By this stage, Mr Salmond was forging a close relationship with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rupert Murdoch and News Corp which is discussed more fully elsewhere in this Report.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref465" href="#footnote465">465</a></sup> In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular, he was hoping to secure the support of The Scottish Sun in the then forthcoming</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2011 Scottish Parliament election. Mr Salmond saw advantage for Scotland in the bid&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">success because News Corp is a big employer in Scotland. He was more than ready to try and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">encourage a successful outcome for the bid. An email from Mr Michel to James Murdoch</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dated 1 November 2010 records Mr Salmond&#8217;s position and that of another unnamed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politician<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref466" href="#footnote466">466</a></sup> with a political interest in the bid&#8217;s success:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref467" href="#footnote467">467</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Mission accomplished.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and around, will contact Vince Cable to ask him to bear in mind the economic /</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investment point of view rather than getting influenced by political games, especially</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in times of austerity and very difficult economic environment for those areas. He</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">will also emphasise the opportunity for Cable to show the maturity of the Libdems</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as coalition partners, working for the long-term, and will draw from the Coalition</span>



 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">government experience lib-dems have had in Scotland. He agrees with the need for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this to be looked at by Brussels rather than scrutinised again on plurality ground in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the UK [sic]</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211;Alex Salmond is very keen to also put these issues across to Cable and have a call</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with you tomorrow or Wednesday. His team will also brief the Scottish press on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">economic importance of News Corp for Scotland.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-6-3"><a href="#para6-3" name="para6-3">6.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Salmond did not quarrel with the thrust of that email and confirmed that he had not only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">spoken to James Murdoch about the bid but also gone on to meet him in London in January</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2011 to discuss the bid and other matters. Mr Salmond explained the importance of the bid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Scotland in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref468" href="#footnote468">468</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It should be understood, I mean, BSkyB is a huge employer in Scotland. We&#8217;re talking</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about more than 6,000 full-time jobs in addition to the 2,000 outsourcing jobs and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">temporary jobs. It&#8217;s vital in Dumfirmline, Livingston, Uddingston. Some 36 per cent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of BSkyB&#8217;s total global employment is in Scotland. They are in the top 10 of Scottish</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">private sector employers. So it&#8217;s a matter of great importance and the argument</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">being forward by Mr Murdoch was that an expansion of the digital platform on a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">European-wide basis would result in additional investment and that Scotland would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be well placed in that context to benefit, given the strength of the Scottish offer in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">terms of competitiveness, to benefit from that additional investment.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-4"><a href="#para6-4" name="para6-4">6.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Salmond confirmed that when he had spoken to James Murdoch by telephone the bid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been mentioned and that he wanted to discuss the bid with Mr Murdoch when he met</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">him:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref469" href="#footnote469">469</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. You refer, though, to the impact of consolidation of BSkyB ownership, so plainly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you had in contemplation at that stage the BSkyB bid; is that right?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. That&#8217;s correct. Prior to this, it had been indicated I think in a phone call &#8211; I&#8217;m sure</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in a phone call, actually, because I wanted to meet Mr Murdoch to discuss this in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">particular. This was one of the key things I wanted to discuss, to understand better the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">argument that the consolidation of ownership would result in additional investment</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and that Scotland was well placed . To be fair &#8211; well, I&#8217;m going to be more than fair,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they can speak with a great deal of authority, if a company has 36 per cent of its global</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">workforce in Scotland, then they speak from a position of some credibility.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">added)</span>

<p id="para-id-6-5"><a href="#para6-5" name="para6-5">6.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He regarded it as his duty to pursue jobs and investment for Scotland and denied any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibility for plurality in the press. He had been prepared to put forward those arguments</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the relevant Secretary of State but, as things turned out, the opportunity to do so never</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">arose:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref470" href="#footnote470">470</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. I think it&#8217;s fairly clear from what you&#8217;ve just said, Mr Salmond, that certainly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from the date of this meeting with Mr James Murdoch you were in favour of the bid.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Is that right?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes. I was in favour of what benefited the Scottish economy. Remember, I have no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">responsibility for broadcasting policy, I have no responsibility for plurality in the press,</span>



 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but I do have a responsibility for jobs and investment in Scotland. That is my statutory</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">responsibility.Indeed,it&#8217;sreflectednotjustinthefactit&#8217;smyresponsibility,it&#8217;sactually</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reflected in our Ministerial Code in Scotland that it is one of the responsibilities that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you must pursue. So I would tend to put an emphasis on the jobs and investment</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">aspects of this. It was for others to consider other matters. And specifically what I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was prepared to do and said I was prepared to do would have been to speak to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relevant Secretary of State to say jobs and investment are going to be a consideration</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">along with other things that they had to consider when these matters were brought</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to decision at the appropriate time .</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">As circumstances turned out, that appropriate time never arose, but I was certainly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">prepared to argue for that and I would certainly say that&#8217;s entirely a legitimate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">preoccupation and argument that the First Minister of Scotland or any Scottish</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">minister should put forward.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-6-6"><a href="#para6-6" name="para6-6">6.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He said that a purpose of his meeting with James Murdoch in January 2011 had been better</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to understand the potential consequences of James Murdoch&#8217;s plans for a European digital</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">platform for Scotland:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref471" href="#footnote471">471</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;MR JAY: Mr Salmond, before January 2011, were you a supporter of the BSkyB bid</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">or not?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. What I&#8217;d said was that I&#8217;d be prepared to argue to the Secretary of State, initially</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Vince Cable, or advance to the Secretary of State the argument that jobs and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investment should be taken into account along with other factors, which were their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">responsibility. I never got the opportunity with Mr Cable, because he disappeared</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from the scene for reasons you know about, and as it happens, I didn&#8217;t get the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">opportunity with Mr Hunt either, but I was certainly of a mind that I wanted to put</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">forward the position that jobs and investment was an important criteria which should</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be taken into account, and the meeting with Mr Murdoch in January which followed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on a phone call in November, I don&#8217;t have a date for it, was because I wanted to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hear in more detail the connection between the European digital platform investment</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">argument and what the consequences might be for Scotland in that respect.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So I was prepared to make that argument and if the circumstances had arisen, then</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I would have made it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-7"><a href="#para6-7" name="para6-7">6.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">To return to the question of Mr Salmond&#8217;s understanding of his role and duty, he made clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he accepted that he knew that Dr Cable and then Mr Hunt were fulfilling a quasi-judicial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">role and had to make their decision insulated from the considerations which Mr Salmond had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intended to raise. Even this knowledge would not have stopped him from trying to advance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considerations which would have led the decision maker into error had they been heeded:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref472" href="#footnote472">472</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Were you advised that Dr Cable was occupying a quasi-judicial role and that he</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had to make the decision insulated from the sort of considerations you might have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wished to bend his ear about?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes. He was; I wasn&#8217;t. Interestingly, as I said earlier, I don&#8217;t have responsibility</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for competition, I don&#8217;t have responsibility for plurality in the media. I do have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">responsibility for jobs and investment in Scotland, and the ministerial code, which</span>


 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we may discuss later in terms of politicians and their inter reaction with businesses</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in Scotland.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">9.29 of the Ministerial Code of Scotland actually makes the point exactly:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">However, nothing in this code should be taken as preventing ministers from fulfilling</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">their proper function of encouraging investment and economic activity for the benefit</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and prosperity of the people of Scotland.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Because within the terms of our remit and responsibilities, what is my responsibility,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the government&#8217;s responsibility obviously takes pre-eminence. And across a whole</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">range of issues, whether it be banking reform or oil taxation would be another</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">issue where we don&#8217;t currently at least have competence, we nonetheless make an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">argument from the Scottish interest, and while Mr Cable or Mr Hunt, however they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">understood it, and I&#8217;m sure they did, were in a quasi-judicial capacity, I wasn&#8217;t . My</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">capacity was quite clear and my ability to represent was also quite clear.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. I hadn&#8217;t considered that provision in the Scottish Ministerial Code before but I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">question, Mr Salmond, whether a very general provision of that nature would entitle</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you, if I may say so, to interfere with a quasi-judicial function which fell to the duty of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Secretary of State in London to discharge.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Well, in that case, can I give you a different example entirely where &#8211; a very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">controversial well-known example, where my colleague Mr MacAskill, the Justice</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Secretary of Scotland, was taking a quasi-judicial decision on the compassionate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">release of Mr al-Megrahi, and indeed on the application for prisoner transfer, where</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">although he was in a quasi-judicial role he invited opinion and evidence, including</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">opinion and evidence from the United Kingdom government.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">Intheevent,theyfortheirownreasonsdecidednottosubmitit,butourunderstanding</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">certainly in Scotland, and I&#8217;m actually pretty certain it&#8217;s the same here, is that people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are able within their responsibilities to make representation. It is for the Secretary of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">State or the politician concerned who is operating in that capacity to make sure that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they stay within the bounds of their responsibilities .&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns the promotion of products and services by association and attempts to influence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public sector procurement and falls to be read in that context. It states:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref473" href="#footnote473">473</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Ministers should also avoid promoting an individual company&#8217;s products or services</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by association. They should also bear in mind public sector procurement procedures</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and resist any attempt to influence them in favour of particular products or services.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">If such attempts are experienced, Ministers should report these to the Director of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Procurement. However, nothing in this Code should be taken as preventing Ministers</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 11 February 2011 Mr Michel met with Mr Salmond&#8217;s adviser. The resulting report from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Michel to James Murdoch is consistent with Mr Salmond&#8217;s evidence that he was standing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ready to speak to Mr Hunt. It also indicates that newspaper coverage and the potential for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a televised First Ministerial debate were discussed on the same occasion. The email read:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref475" href="#footnote475">475</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I met with Alex Salmond&#8217;s adviser today</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He will call Hunt whenever we need him to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">1 &#8211; He noticed a major change in the Sun&#8217;s coverage recently. The Daily Record is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">running a very personal campaign against him</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2 &#8211; He believes the time has come to organise a First Ministerial debate between him</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and Ian Gray [Labour leader], who are the two only possible FM candidates.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He would be very keen for Sky News to organise it with Adam. There is a timing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">issue as it would have to be organised before dissolution on 22nd March.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">added)</span>

<p id="para-id-6-11"><a href="#para6-11" name="para6-11">6.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Asked about the reference to the Sun&#8217;s coverage in the above email, Mr Salmond pointed out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that The Sun did not commit to support the SNP until March 2011, although he seemed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accept that there had been something of a change in The Sun&#8217;s coverage. His evidence was:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref476" href="#footnote476">476</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Does that reflect an underlying reality that the Sun was more favourably disposed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to you and your party at about this time?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I don&#8217;t know. Certainly they weren&#8217;t &#8211; I think the new editor had probably come in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by this time. The Sun had not declared for the SNP at that time...&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">and:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. I think the gist of your evidence is you wouldn&#8217;t disassociate yourself from the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">perception at least Mr Aberdain [Mr Salmond&#8217;s adviser] had about the Sun&#8217;s coverage;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is that right?&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I think we did feel that the new editor was treating things a bit differently, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">certainly at that stage there was no commitment from the editor to support the SNP</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the election, because that I&#8217;m sure came later. In fact, it came in March.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-12"><a href="#para6-12" name="para6-12">6.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The third and final of three emails from Mr Michel to Mr Murdoch to refer to Mr Salmond</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the context of the bid is dated 2 March 2011, the day before Mr Hunt announced that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was minded to accept the UIL in their then form and consequently began the first statutory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consultation. It records Mr Salmond expressly seeking help to ensure that The Sun did</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">support the SNP at the then forthcoming election. It also confirms Mr Salmond&#8217;s continuing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">willingness to support the bid. Insofar as is relevant, it read:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref477" href="#footnote477">477</a></sup></span>



 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Alex Salmond called. He had a very good dinner with the Editor of the Sun in Scotland</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">yesterday.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Sun is now keen to back the SNP at the election. The Editor will make his pitch to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Editorial team tomorrow .</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Alex wanted to see whether we could help smooth the way for the process.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He also asked whether we could go for dinner at Bute House before the election</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">campaign kicks off on the 22<span style="font-size: 9px;"> nd</span> March.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">On the Sky bid, he will make himself available to support the debate if consultation is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">launched.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-6-13"><a href="#para6-13" name="para6-13">6.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Salmond confirmed that he had called Mr Michel. The meal to which he referred was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one of two meetings which he had had with the editor of The Sun. He had gone to see the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editor following his meeting with James Murdoch in January (at which he had met Mr Michel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the first time). When seeking support on that occasion he had been told to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> go</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> see</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the editor<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span><span style="font-style:normal"> He</span><span style="font-style:normal"> said</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> what</span><span style="font-style:normal"> is</span><span style="font-style:normal"> recorded</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> email</span><span style="font-style:normal"> as</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span><span style="font-style:normal"> request</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> smooth</span><span style="font-style:normal"> things</span><span style="font-style:normal"> over</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was in fact a plea to prevent London vetoing the Scottish editor&#8217;s wish to support the SNP:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;All I wanted was a lack of influence. I wanted &#8211; the editorial team were well up for the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cup&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><span style="font-style:normal"> He</span><span style="font-style:normal"> denied</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> discussion</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> both</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> bid</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> political</span><span style="font-style:normal"> support</span><span style="font-style:normal"> for</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> SNP</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> same</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conversation amounted to a subtle and reciprocal exchange of favours.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref478" href="#footnote478">478</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-14"><a href="#para6-14" name="para6-14">6.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The history of Mr Salmond&#8217;s readiness to intervene in the bid, on News Corp&#8217;s behalf, is of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">real interest. He stood ready to lobby first Dr Cable and later Mr Hunt, prepared to argue that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it would be good for Scotland and Scottish jobs. Had he done so he would have been seeking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to persuade a quasi-judicial decision maker to take into account a factor which was irrelevant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the statutory plurality test. Plurality was the only consideration which could legitimately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been taken into account by the Secretary of State. Acceding to Mr Salmond&#8217;s argument</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would have rendered the decision unlawful.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-15"><a href="#para6-15" name="para6-15">6.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Salmond adamantly believed that he was entitled to make his case and that responsibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for ensuring that the decision was properly taken rested entirely with the Secretary of State.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Salmond is right that legal responsibility for taking the decision lawfully rested with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State. But it does not follow that he was entirely at liberty to seek to persuade</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Secretary of State into error (particularly, if successful, it could potentially have had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the effect of giving rise to grounds for challenge). Neither do I understand how a section of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Scottish Ministerial Code dealing with public sector procurement assists. Mr Salmond&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">duty to promote the Scottish economy and Scottish jobs cannot sensibly be understood as</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">requiring irrelevant submissions to be made to a quasi-judicial decision maker.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-16"><a href="#para6-16" name="para6-16">6.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence does not go so far as to show either an express or an implied deal between Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Salmond and James Murdoch trading newspaper support for assistance with the bid. What</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it did reveal was the way in which Mr Salmond was expressly seeking the support of The Sun</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the same conversation as he was repeating an offer to assist with the bid. That occurred in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the context of a relationship between Mr Salmond and News Corp which had been warming</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">since 2007 and was continuing to do so. Mr Salmond&#8217;s readiness, when the subject was first</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">raised in November 2010 and thereafter, to stand ready to assist News Corp is striking.</span>

 <p id="para-id-6-17"><a href="#para6-17" name="para6-17">6.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have absolutely no doubt that Mr Salmond was motivated by an anxiety to help Scottish</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">employment and to benefit Scotland generally: that is entirely laudable and exactly what is the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expectation and proper function of the First Minister. How far that should be taken, however,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is another matter. He appreciated that employment whether in Scotland or elsewhere was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not a relevant consideration for the Minister and, in fact, he never contacted either Dr Cable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or Mr Hunt to argue the contrary. Judged by what he did, as opposed to what he said he was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prepared to do, therefore, he cannot be criticised.</span>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p id="para-id-6-18"><a href="#para6-18" name="para6-18">6.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The handling of News Corp&#8217;s 2010 bid for BSkyB proved to be an illuminating case study,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">highlighting the difficulties which politicians face when dealing with acutely sensitive media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues, in this instance a plurality decision. The picture which emerged, at a macro level, is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a swing from the clear perception of bias against News Corp on the part of Dr Cable in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">comments he made to his &#8216;constituents&#8217; to a highly unsatisfactory course of communications</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between Mr Michel and Mr Smith on Mr Hunt&#8217;s watch which itself risked a finding of apparent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bias in favour of News Corp. It involved political lobbying by News Corp, wholly without regard</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the restricted ambit of the plurality test, and at least one politician expressing himself</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be &#8216;standing ready&#8217; to lobby on grounds that he was aware were legally irrelevant but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">served his (entirely legitimate) political interests. Had the bid not failed for other reasons, Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Michel&#8217;s activities, of which James Murdoch was aware, would have put at risk a favourable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision, had one materialised. In that respect not only was their activity misguided, it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also ultimately contrary to the interests of News Corp.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-19"><a href="#para6-19" name="para6-19">6.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is also highly material to issues concerning the relationship between the development of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">policy (where we depend on the democratically elected politicians and Government) and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those who are in a position to use their powerful megaphones to advance causes which they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">support, namely the press (not, of course, constrained by the requirements of impartiality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">imposed on broadcasters). As I have made clear, dialogue between politicians and the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is greatly to the benefit of our democracy and entirely in the public interest. Where the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest and private media interests can collide, however, care must be taken to ensure that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the former prevails and the latter is recognised for what it is.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-20"><a href="#para6-20" name="para6-20">6.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The difficulties which the politicians concerned had with this bid gives pause for thought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as to whether and, if so, in what capacity politicians ought to be involved in media plurality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decisions. It is a question on which the Inquiry heard the views of both Dr Cable and Mr Hunt.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Cable thought it right that politicians ought to be involved.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref479" href="#footnote479">479</a></sup> Mr Hunt believed that it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">possible to set aside political and personal views but believed that, by taking and publishing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advice, he had applied a valuable lock to the process with which to help safeguard it. He could,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in practice, only depart from the advice if he could convincingly and publicly explain why.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref480" href="#footnote480">480</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-21"><a href="#para6-21" name="para6-21">6.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A detailed consideration of the issues relevant to plurality is described elsewhere in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Report<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref481" href="#footnote481">481</a></sup> and the issue is not, therefore, taken further in the concluding part of the analysis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the bid by News Corp for the remaining shares in BSkyB. What this analysis does reveal,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">however, is that a new approach is essential. Repetition of the problems which arose on this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bid is undeniably not in the public interest.</span>
