<h2>1. The 1992 general election</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Labour Party&#8217;s media strategy going into the 1992 election campaign did not aim to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">win over hostile sections of the media and was positively averse to engaging with News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">International (NI) in particular. It included some manifesto pledges on media policies to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which elements of the press were explicitly opposed, including on implementation of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations in the Calcutt Report and the establishment of an urgent inquiry by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Monopolies and Mergers Commissions into the concentration of media ownership.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was, in the event, significant negative coverage of both the Labour Party in general and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its Leader, now Lord Kinnock, in particular throughout the election campaign. Even the victor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of that election, Sir John Major, described it as both &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> pretty</span><span style="font-style:italic"> crude</span><span style="font-style:italic"> campaign&#8221;</span> against Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Kinnock and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> over</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> top&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> The Rt Hon Jack Straw MP, a Labour candidate at the election,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described the experience in his evidence in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Now, what the Sun was doing in the 1992 election was working over each senior</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">member of the Labour front bench and this had an effect, and if you were on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">receiving end of it, it felt like power. It had an effect in my constituency. I remember</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">doing an open-air meeting that Wednesday and you could feel support falling away,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and my majority scarcely moved, although it did not reflect the national swing&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At the climax of The Sun&#8217;s election coverage were two particularly negative and personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">headlines directed against Lord Kinnock. &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Nightmare</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Kinnock</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Street</span> &#8221; was followed, on</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">coverage in the years running up to election, and in particular The Sun&#8217;s coverage during the</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Kelvin MacKenzie, then the editor of The Sun, famously proclaimed through a headline after</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Conservative victory that: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> It&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Sun</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Wot</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Won</span><span style="font-style:italic"> It&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> Rupert Murdoch distanced himself</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from that; in his own words, he gave Mr MacKenzie &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hell</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> bollocking&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> Mr Murdoch</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that sort of power. I think if you &#8211; well, you can&#8217;t do it now, but if you go after an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">election and you see a newspaper that&#8217;s taken a very strong line, particularly the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Kinnock, in his resignation speech delivered on 13 April 1992, blamed his defeat on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the newspapers which had supported the Conservatives, quoting the former Conservative</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">None of the witnesses who gave evidence to the Inquiry suggested that The Sun&#8217;s support</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the Conservatives had in fact been decisive, although many, especially in other parties,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thought that it was very influential. Alastair Campbell put it this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I am not sure if it can be claimed, as the Sun did after the Tories won in 1992, that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;it was the Sun wot won it,&#8221; but there is no doubt in my mind that the systematic</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">undermining of Labour and its leader and policies through these papers, actively</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">encouraged and fed with lines of attack by Tory HQ, was a factor in Labour&#8217;s inability</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">properly to connect with the public, and ultimate defeat.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Rt Hon Harriet Harman MP&#8217;s analysis was similar: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> The</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Labour</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Party</span><span style="font-style:italic"> went</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> receive</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">extremely hostile coverage from newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch. We then lost the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any doubt that the Sun&#8217;s approach lost us seats. That was their purpose, and it is disingenuous</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for any now to deny this<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Even</span><span style="font-style:normal"> more</span><span style="font-style:normal"> succinctly:</span><span style="font-style:normal"> &#8220;</span> It did contribute to our defeat.

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir John Major, whilst critical of the treatment of Lord Kinnock, did not think that it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">actually so influential:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;How much did that affect the election? Labour Party mythology has it that it made a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">huge difference. I don&#8217;t actually think so. I think the news coverage in 1992 and 1997</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">accelerated a trend that existed. I do not think it changed the result of either of those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">General Elections. I think we would have won in 1992; we would have lost in 1997.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-10"><a href="#para1-10" name="para1-10">1.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whether or not press coverage affected the outcome of the election, it is clear that the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">experience had an impact on the perceptions of politicians as to the importance of political</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">strategies of political parties. The Rt Hon Tony Blair put it this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. I return to the issue of spin. I think we agreed that it was borne out of the unfair</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">treatment, in your eyes, of Mr Kinnock&#8217;s Labour Party, which required a disciplined</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and possibly a ruthless handling of the press. Is that right?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. Yeah, but you see I draw a very clear distinction between what I would say is a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">very tough professional media operation and ruthless handling of the press in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sense of &#8211; when I read this stuff about how people felt bullied and harassed and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">intimidated and so on ...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-11"><a href="#para1-11" name="para1-11">1.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Campbell recounted an active choice to change the Labour Party&#8217;s approach to what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he described as the Murdoch papers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup> He described Rupert Murdoch as the single most</span>

<p id="para-id-1-12"><a href="#para1-12" name="para1-12">1.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Straw said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...once Mr Blair had come into office in 1994, we all shared the same view, that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">if humanly possible, without completely compromising ourselves, we should do our</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">best to get the papers on side. It was better than the alternative. This was because I&#8217;d</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been through 18 years of opposition.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-13"><a href="#para1-13" name="para1-13">1.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Harman, questioned at the Inquiry, offered this perspective:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. May I sort of turn that around and say, well, those manifesto commitments</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which we saw in 1992 were singularly absent in 1997, and there was a reason for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">their being absent, which was not to estrange or inflame or otherwise discourage the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Murdoch press. Is there force in that observation?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. Well, I think it goes back to what Tony Blair said in what became known as his</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2007 &#8220;feral beast&#8221; speech, is that we, after all those years in opposition and believing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that we wanted to get into government to do things on the health service and on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">unemployment and on whole range of things, that it felt necessary to do more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">assuaging, neutralising, courting, that was the decision that was taken, and that did</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">feel like it was necessary.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-14"><a href="#para1-14" name="para1-14">1.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Blair put it slightly differently:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Between 1994-1997, we did change Labour&#8217;s policy on media ownership. However</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it should be remembered that this policy was itself partly a product of the terrible</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relations between the Labour Party and the Murdoch press and the unions and that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press. My view was and remains that there should be no presumption in favour of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any media organisation or against it; that foreign ownership should not be regarded</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with undue interference through size whether within one medium or across media, is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">through competition policy. So it would be fair to say that had we kept that policy, it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would have been a problem with the Murdoch press. But there were sound objective</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reasons for changing it. I can&#8217;t recall any conversations on it with anyone from the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">He made very clear that he had not wanted media policy to distract him from his agenda of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wider political reform:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...I mean, I&#8217;d taken the view I was not going to have the Labour Party coming back</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">into power after 18 years with a programme of change for the country and having the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">centrepiece of the programme being issues to do with media ownership. I thought</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that would have been a distraction and wrong&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-17"><a href="#para1-17" name="para1-17">1.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The scale of the distraction which Mr Blair believed would have resulted had he made media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reform a central plank of his agenda was forcefully put:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;My view, rightly or wrongly, was that if, in those circumstances, I had said, &#8220;Right,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I&#8217;ve decided what I&#8217;m going to do is take on the media and change the law in relation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the media&#8221;, my view is &#8211; and I think it&#8217;s still my view, actually &#8211; that you would have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had to clear the decks. This would have been an absolute confrontation. You would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have had virtually every part of the media against you in doing it, and I felt the price</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you would pay for that would actually push out a lot of the things I cared about, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">although, you know &#8211; I think I say towards the end of my statement: although I think</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this is an immensely important question , I mean, I don&#8217;t, in the end &#8211; not for me at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any rate, as the Prime Minister, was it more important than the health service or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">schools or law and order.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...If you take this on, do not think for a single moment you are not in a long, protracted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">battle that will shove everything else to one side whilst it&#8217;s going on&#8221;.</span>

<a name="page1137"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Labour party was haunted by the treatment Neil Kinnock received as Labour</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">leader and they were absolutely determined not to go through that again. They</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wanted a fair hearing. If they couldn&#8217;t get the endorsement they wanted a more level</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">playing field; as you know, in the end they got the endorsement&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-20"><a href="#para1-20" name="para1-20">1.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Adam Boulton noted not only the Labour Party&#8217;s close attention to the media after 1992 but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also that the Conservatives later adopted a similar closeness to the press. Asked whether he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">agreed with the words of Mr Blair:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;...We</span><span style="font-style:italic"> paid</span><span style="font-style:italic"> inordinate</span><span style="font-style:italic"> attention</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> early</span><span style="font-style:italic"> days</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> New</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Yes, I would. As I also say, there was a reason for it, as has been cited elsewhere in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry. The soreness which Labour felt about the 1992 treatment of Neil Kinnock</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the feeling that they needed to turn the media around if they were going to have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a chance of getting their message across in 1997, but it struck me reading that again</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">how remarkably close that is to some of the remarks that the current Prime Minister</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">made last summer&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-21"><a href="#para1-21" name="para1-21">1.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was open hostility between sections of the press and the Labour Party during the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1980s, most acutely in the Labour Party&#8217;s refusal to deal with NI as a result of the Wapping</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dispute. It was to a degree personal. Sections of the press used the power of personal attack</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and deployed both a sustained campaign of negative and aggressive personal coverage over</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a long period as well as a more concentrated burst during the 1992 General Election.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-22"><a href="#para1-22" name="para1-22">1.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Labour&#8217;s 1992 election manifesto contained policies which reflected (on Mr Blair&#8217;s own</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">analysis) the poor relationship between Labour and sections of the press, especially NI. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pledge to implement Sir David Calcutt&#8217;s proposals if self-regulation failed put the party at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">odds with much of the press, and the promise to call for an urgent inquiry by the MMC into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media ownership were, however principled, consciously oppositional.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-23"><a href="#para1-23" name="para1-23">1.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is worth repeating the real difficulty in determining precisely what impact the negative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">coverage of Labour politicians had on the outcome of the 1992 election. People do not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessarily agree with the opinions which they read in their newspapers, or they may already</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be of the same view and need no persuasion. However, it would be idle to suppose that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sustained negative coverage had no effect. It is reasonable to conclude that political coverage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can influence voting, although it is important not to overstate the degree to which it can or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does do so.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-24"><a href="#para1-24" name="para1-24">1.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Perhaps of even greater importance, and certainly easier to discern, is the impact of the 1992</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">election on perceptions about the power of the press to influence the fortunes of political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parties. A belief that improved relations with the press were vital to future election prospects</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">is agreed to have been a cornerstone of New Labour&#8217;s approach, a lesson learned from Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Kinnock&#8217;s treatment by sections of the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-25"><a href="#para1-25" name="para1-25">1.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The impact of personally hostile media coverage is not exclusively a Labour Party issue.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Conservative politicians also bear in mind the fate of Sir John Major&#8217;s Government which, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">time, came to attract coverage every bit as negative and personal as that which Lord Kinnock</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had endured.</span>

<h2>2. The 1997 general election</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 21 July 1994, Mr Blair was elected as Leader of the Labour Party, heralding a new era in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship between the Labour Party and the media.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup> Mr Blair himself told the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;... by the time I took over the leadership of the Labour Party, we&#8217;d lost four elections</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in a row, We&#8217;d actually never won two consecutive full elections in our history ... I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">went through that 1992 election. I remember it. It was etched on my memory and ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I was absolutely determined that we should not be subject to the same onslaught ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We paid inordinate attention in the early days of New Labour to courting, assuaging</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and persuading the media&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He described this new era as one of<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;courting,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> assuaging</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> persuading</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> media&#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup> Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Blair confirmed that he met Rupert Murdoch on at least one occasion before becoming leader;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this was on 15 September 1994 at a private dinner at a restaurant.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup> Although Mr Murdoch</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could not recall the dinner, he accepted in evidence that much of what was attributed to him</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by a number of sources sounded plausible.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup> From this it may be possible to infer that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Blair took the opportunity to explain that the Labour Party would not undertake an inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into cross-media ownership, and also the state of policy on the statutory recognition of Trade</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Unions.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The new strategy appears to have had almost immediate effect. Within just a few days of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his election as Labour Party Leader, it was being reported that Rupert Murdoch had stated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publicly that he &#8216;could imagine&#8217; backing Blair<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup> (Mr Murdoch&#8217;s evidence was that although he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not remember saying this, it was quite possible that he had).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 27 July 1994,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup> Mr Blair appointed Mr Campbell (then assistant editor at Today, a NI</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper)<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup> as part of his political and election strategy team. Mr Campbell played a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prominent role in repositioning the relationship of the Labour Party with the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup> He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">became in due course the Prime Minister&#8217;s Chief Press Secretary in May 1997 and on 15 July</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2000 was appointed Director of Communications and Strategy at No 10.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Campbell himself stated in evidence that, as soon as he was appointed in 1994, he set</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">himself the objective of ensuring that Mr Blair did not suffer the same fate as Lord Kinnock.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationships with the media.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup> He said this about it:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref38" href="#footnote38">38</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In addition to the historic bias against Labour, the Wapping dispute had given rise to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">real bitterness between parts of the media and the Labour Party, to the extent that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Party did not communicate with, for example, some of the Murdoch titles. Also</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other titles like the Mail and the Express were so supportive of the Tories, and hostile</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to Labour, that our people tended to avoid them. We changed that approach very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deliberately. Part of our message was that there was no part of public opinion we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were afraid of and where we would not take the basic arguments of Labour&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Blair appointed Lord Mandelson (then MP for Hartlepool) to manage the Labour Party&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">general election campaign. Lord Mandelson described his role as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref39" href="#footnote39">39</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Now, part of that was to reassure the media that we weren&#8217;t the same Labour Party,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and that, in a sense, trying to persuade them that we were no longer the toxic brand</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the 1980s you could describe as an attempt to sort of neutralise, to sort of take the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">roughest edges off their hostility to us&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 17 July 1995, Mr Blair accepted the invitation of Mr Murdoch and News Corp to attend</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their conference at Hayman Island and to deliver a speech. In evidence to the Inquiry, Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Blair said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;... I would strongly defend that decision. It is important to understand that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Murdoch press (a) represented a large part of the media with large numbers of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">readers i.e. voters and (b) had been viscerally hostile to the Labour Party. The fact is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I was changing the Labour Party to become New Labour ... The continued hostilities</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">between the Murdoch Group and Labour had no rationale to it given our changes and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the fact that the Conservative Government was running out of steam. Actually, my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">speech held closely to all the policies I believed in&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He added:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I had a minimum and maximum objective. The minimum objective was to stop them</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">tearing us to pieces and the maximum objective was, if possible, to open the way</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to support. Now, actually, the speech I gave &#8211; yes, of course you had to balance it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">very carefully. There&#8217;s no policy I changed, and actually in the speech I went out of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my way &#8211; and we were very careful about this &#8211; to make sure I emphasised support</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for minimum wage, union recognition, pro-European position, increases in public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investment, all of which may not have been what they wanted to hear. On the other</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hand, what I felt perfectly comfortable in doing was saying &#8211; and this I was perfectly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">comfortable with saying &#8211; &#8220;This Labour Party is going to be a party of aspiration, not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">merely redistribution. It&#8217;s going to be a party that&#8217;s going to appeal to the emerging</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">aspirant working class. It&#8217;s going to be a party that is essentially about creating a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">meritocratic society and expanding opportunity and it&#8217;s not going to go back to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">old ways&#8221;. But that was a message I was determined to give to the country.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">But what is important, I think, to emphasise ... I actually did have in all the things that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we were committed to they wouldn&#8217;t like. I was also &#8211; because I was having to watch</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my other audience as well&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Murdoch put it this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I distinctly recall Mr Blair&#8217;s address at our conference on Hayman Island. He spoke</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">convincinglyoftheabilityofanewLabourPartytoenergiseBritain.Idorecallbelieving</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that Mr Blair and the policies he advocated could help revitalise Britain, and sharing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that view with newspaper editors at the conference, who were also impressed by Mr</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">Blair&#8217;s speech&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He also confirmed that he may well have said the following when thanking Mr Blair for his</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">speech:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;If our flirtation is ever consummated, Tony, then I suspect we will end up making love</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">like porcupines, very, very carefully&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The different perceptions and perspectives on the dynamics of this interaction interested</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry. Mr Murdoch was keen to impress on the Inquiry a view that all the power and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">influence lay with politicians, but Mr Blair&#8217;s evidence and autobiography were very different.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He spoke of feeling &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic"> this</span><span style="font-style:italic"> pretty</span><span style="font-style:italic"> intense</span><span style="font-style:italic"> power</span> &#8217; in the relationship (although Mr Murdoch was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not mentioned by name in this context).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-12"><a href="#para2-12" name="para2-12">2.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This contrast was particularly striking. Mr Murdoch:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;As for the &#8216;value&#8217; to me of these meetings, my view is that if an editor or publisher</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is invited or otherwise has an opportunity to meet with a head of government or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">political leader, you go...&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Blair:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Again, now, it seems obvious: the country&#8217;s most powerful newspaper proprietor,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whose publications have hitherto been rancorous in their opposition to the Labour</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">Party, invites us into the lion&#8217;s den. You go, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-14"><a href="#para2-14" name="para2-14">2.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Shortly before the 1997 election, Mr Blair wrote two articles in The Sun about the Labour</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Party&#8217;s commitment to a referendum on the Euro:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;I&#8217;m</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> British</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Patriot&#8221;</span> on 17 March 1997</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;My</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Love</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Pound&#8221;</span> on 17 April 1997. Mr Campbell recalled that it had been made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear to him by the editor of The Sun that, if Mr Blair were to emphasise the point in these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">articles that there would be no entry into the Euro without a specific referendum on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue, and that he understood people&#8217;s fears about a so-called European super-state, this was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">likely to be the final piece of the jigsaw before Mr Murdoch agreed that the paper would back</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Labour Party at the election.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref49" href="#footnote49">49</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Campbell and Mr Blair both emphasised to the Inquiry that they did not tailor their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">policies to seek favour from the proprietor of The Sun. Instead, they sought to highlight those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parts of Labour Party policies which might appeal to Sun readers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup> Mr Campbell noted, as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an example, that holding a referendum on the Euro was already official policy long before</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Sun made the request it did.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">51</a></sup> In other words, there was alignment. There were also</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">&#8216;<span style="font-style:italic"> concessions</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> rhetoric&#8217;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref52" href="#footnote52">52</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-16"><a href="#para2-16" name="para2-16">2.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The landslide victory of New Labour in 1997, and the decisive defeat of Sir John Major, have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been widely analysed. Policies, personalities and the public mood on the one hand, and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press on the other, were all in the same place. The press no doubt both reflected and affected</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public opinion, in immeasurable proportions. Mr Murdoch generally backed the winning side</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(although he also stated that he sought to judge the candidates on the issues, not on whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they were likely to win).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup> Mr Campbell put it this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref54" href="#footnote54">54</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Again, I do not believe that the papers swung the result, though they may have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">helped increase the majority because of the sense of momentum we were able to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">gather. I believe the Sun backed us because they knew we were going to win: we did</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not win because they backed us. But it is certainly the case that we very deliberately</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">set out to get our voice and our arguments heard in papers normally hostile to us, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that this had the positive political impact we sought.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-17"><a href="#para2-17" name="para2-17">2.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Blair was asked to comment on a passage from Chris Mullin&#8217;s diaries dealing with the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I think it is. I mean, as I say, this is going back 18 years or 17&#189; years now, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">certainly that was my attitude. I think now, by the way, I would have a slightly different</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">view. In other words, I think &#8211; there was a view of Rupert Murdoch, which I think Paul</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Keating speaks to the same effect, which is that he just backs the winner. My view</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">now is it&#8217;s not as simple as that actually. There are very strong political views and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">those actually do come first, I think, or put it like this: they&#8217;re equal first, let&#8217;s say, with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whatever interests he feels in being on the winning side or the losing side, and &#8211; you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know, so I&#8217;m not &#8211; my view of this now is if he&#8217;d been persuaded &#8211; I mean, it looked</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as if we were going to win, so you didn&#8217;t have to be a genius to think we had a good</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">chance of winning, although when you&#8217;ve lost four a row, by the way, you never think</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it&#8217;s that clear. So I&#8217;m not sure I would have the same view now about that, but that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">may well have been what I said to Chris and to &#8211; and yes, look, if I&#8217;d ended up in a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">situation where they turned on me, I would have had to fight back. You know, there&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">no &#8211; that would have been the only recourse. And we weren&#8217;t &#8211; in 1992, we weren&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">really in a position where we were able to fight back, but this time we would have&#8221;.</span>

<h2>3. Prime Minister blair: 1997 &#8211; 2007</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Blair took an early step, by way of the Civil Service Amendment Order in Council 1997, to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appoint Mr Campbell to an unprecedented position, a political or Special Advisor role with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">power to instruct permanent civil servants.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref56" href="#footnote56">56</a></sup> An indication of the considerable importance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attached to news management strategies in the early years of the administration, it proved in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the end to have been a highly controversial step, which has not been subsequently repeated.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord O&#8217;Donnell viewed the matter in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref57" href="#footnote57">57</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;... [this amendment] blurred those lines between what a special adviser does and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what civil servants do, and I think, with the benefit of hindsight, it didn&#8217;t work as well</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as it should have done because it created the idea that the civil servants were obeying</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">some rules by someone who was politically appointed, which meant that they also</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would be politically biased, and so it ... I don&#8217;t think it was a good idea. I was very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pleased when it was abandoned, and I did advise that it should be abandoned, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that&#8217;s very good. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an experiment we will try again, I hope&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Blair himself observed with the benefit of hindsight: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> event,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> apparently,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> didn&#8217;t</span></span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Campbell told the Inquiry that many of the other changes relevant to relations between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government and the media made by Mr Blair during his time as Prime Minister were designed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to ensure that politics, and media coverage of it, was more &#8216;on the record&#8217;, in an effort to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">make politics more accessible to the public.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup> These included &#8216;lobby&#8217; briefings both being put</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the record and made available online, monthly Prime Ministerial press conferences, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the agreement that Mr Blair would attend select committees in addition to answering Prime</span>

<a name="page1143"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">Minister&#8217;s Questions. These changes addressed the more formal aspects of the relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between the press and politicians; not all of them were popular on the press side. Adam</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Boulton said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;After 2003 Tony Blair attempted to restore media relations by establishing regular</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">monthly news conferences. He honoured these punctually even when the chosen date</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">coincided with a &#8217;crisis&#8217;. However, they were never popular with the press who felt the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">electronic media benefitted disproportionately and neither Brown nor Cameron have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">continued with regular extended news conferences.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Blair articulated his overall strategy in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref61" href="#footnote61">61</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;My view was this: I, as say, took a strategic decision that this was not an issue that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I was going to take on ... when I came to office ... there was a whole set of things we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wanted to do. My view, rightly or wrongly, was that if in those circumstances, I had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">said &#8216;Right, I&#8217;ve decided what I&#8217;m going to do is take on the media and change the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">law in relation to the media&#8221;, my view is that &#8211; and I think it&#8217;s still my view actually</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; that you would have had to clear the decks. This would have been an absolutely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">major confrontation. You would have had virtually every part of the media against</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you doing it, and I felt that the price you would pay for that would actually push out</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a lot of the things I cared more about&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He added:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref62" href="#footnote62">62</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We&#8217;d ... been out of power for 18 years. We got into a rhythm which is very much the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rhythm of opposition. So we were still, as it were, campaigning, you know, in the first</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">few months, possibly the first year of government, but frankly after that time, you got</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">into a proper rhythm of government and we had a very strong media operation...&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Campbell said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref63" href="#footnote63">63</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t make any apology for the changes we made in opposition because they helped</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">us to win. I don&#8217;t make apologies for the changes we made in government because</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they helped us to communicate more effectively and I think that helped the Prime</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Minister to govern more effectively. What I do accept is that at times, we probably</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were too controlling, that at times we did hang on to some of the techniques of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">opposition when we should have dumped them at the door of Number 10, but I&#8217;d also</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ask you to bear in mind the sheer volume of issues we were expected to deal with, be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on top of. 24/7 media means just that. You are dealing with this 24 hours a day at a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">time when, in my case, also trying to be in charge of overall strategy as well&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>

<a name="page1144"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">distinctive and observable differences in the conduct of relations between politicians and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press. As Lord Mandelson put it:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref64" href="#footnote64">64</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Because of the particular and specific public duties of a minister, and the requirement</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for these to be carried out in a transparent and accountable manner, my strictures</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would apply more to government than opposition politicians, but not exclusively. And,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of course, the circumstances of a minister&#8217;s job are very different from opposition.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The intensely scrutinised fishbowl world of government places incredible demands</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the time, energy and focus of those who inhabit it. Ministers have less and less</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">time in the day for policy deliberation and formulation because of media (as well as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">parliamentary) demands. On the other hand, politicians &#8211; ministers in particular &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have greater opportunities than ever to communicate directly with electorates.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Blair&#8217;s Government enjoyed a &#8216;honeymoon period&#8217; with the press; Mr Campbell</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">summarised the trajectory in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref65" href="#footnote65">65</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Though the press largely turned against him at various stages of his premiership,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and some continue to campaign relentlessly against him even now, we did have a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fairly benign media environment for some years, and by the time they turned, most</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the public knew him well enough to have a fairly settled view&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">And, in Lord Mandelson&#8217;s view:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref66" href="#footnote66">66</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think Mr Blair ... rescued and made good Labour&#8217;s relations with the media. I think</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he was two or three years into government and they started taking a further dive,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and climaxed, in a way when they became their worst at the time of the Iraq War&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-10"><a href="#para3-10" name="para3-10">3.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The personal dimension of the relationship is, again, an interesting one. Mr Blair took the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view that, as time wore on, he, and more particularly his family, were often unfairly subjected</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to personal intrusion and attack. Although the Blairs were friendly with the Rothermeres, he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cited the Daily Mail as being, from his perspective, particularly personal in this respect. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref67" href="#footnote67">67</a></sup><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref68" href="#footnote68">68</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The fact is, if you fall out with the controlling element of the [newspaper] ... you are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">then going to be subject to a huge and sustained attack. The [newspaper] for me &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they&#8217;ve attacked me, my family, my children, those people associated with me, day</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in, day out, not merely when I was in office but subsequent to it as well. So that is &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and they do it very well, very effectively, and it&#8217;s very powerful ... With any of these</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">big media groups, you fall out with them and you watch out, because it is literally</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relentless and unremitting once that happens and my view is that what creates this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">situation in which these media people get a power in the system that is unhealthy and</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which I have felt, throughout my time, uncomfortable with&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-12"><a href="#para3-12" name="para3-12">3.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Mandelson&#8217;s evidence was along these lines:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref71" href="#footnote71">71</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;It is also arguably the case, however, that personal relationships between Mr Blair,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mr Brown and Rupert Murdoch became closer than was wise in view of the adverse</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">inference drawn from the number of meetings and contacts they had.&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-13"><a href="#para3-13" name="para3-13">3.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Blair did not accept that his relationship with Mr Murdoch was too close in that sense. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">spoke more generally of the danger of relationships which were &#8216;unhealthy&#8217;; he said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref72" href="#footnote72">72</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;...but the relationship is one in which you feel this &#8211; this pretty intense power and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">need to try to deal with that...&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that is to say by managing rather than confronting it,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref73" href="#footnote73">73</a></sup> by building a relationship with Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch and others within NI. This entailed meetings and contact in private as well as in an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">official context.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-14"><a href="#para3-14" name="para3-14">3.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Blair&#8217;s relationship with Rebekah Brooks may well have been warmer, when he was</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">characterisation of him being &#8216;a constant presence&#8217; in her life.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref75" href="#footnote75">75</a></sup> Mr Blair also accepted that,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">after his third election victory in 2005, both Mrs Brooks and Mr Murdoch were a sympathetic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pair of ears in an increasingly hostile media landscape.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref76" href="#footnote76">76</a></sup> As with Mr Murdoch, Mr Blair said</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his personal friendship with Mrs Brooks did not really develop until after he left office: as he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">put it, when free from the constraints of power.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref77" href="#footnote77">77</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both Mr Blair and Mr Campbell emphasised to the Inquiry that, viewed objectively, there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were many aspects of the Government&#8217;s media policies which ran contrary to the interests</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">of NI:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref78" href="#footnote78">78</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;I mean, if you just look at the big policy decisions we took, the biggest in the media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sphere is probably the rise of the BBC licence fee. They weren&#8217;t terribly happy about</span>

<a name="page1146"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that. Ofcom, I think Mr Murdoch said in his evidence, not terribly happy about that.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He tried to take over Manchester United and was blocked. The digital switch, there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were differences. ITV, Channel 5 &#8211; there were lots of areas where you&#8217;d be hard-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pressed to say that the Murdochs and the Murdoch businesses were getting a good</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deal out of the Labour government.&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-16"><a href="#para3-16" name="para3-16">3.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Again, although the party changed its policy in relation to the Euro notwithstanding Mr Blair&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sympathy in principle with the idea of entering the single currency, the fact that the eventual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government position aligned with Mr Murdoch&#8217;s is explicable by reference to very many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">objective factors.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-17"><a href="#para3-17" name="para3-17">3.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The perception of influence has, however, been a persistent point of debate. In March</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1998, Mr Murdoch confirmed to The Times that he had requested Mr Blair to ask the Italian</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prime Minister, Romano Prodi, whether the Italian Government would allow Mr Murdoch to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acquire Mediaset, Italy&#8217;s leading commercial television network. It should be noted that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch&#8217;s intention was not that Mr Blair seek to persuade his Italian counterpart to waive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the bid through, in obvious contravention of EU and domestic law, but rather that Mr Blair</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ascertain whether it was worth his making a formal bid, given that he was not an Italian or EU</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">national. The acquisition did not in the event proceed.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-18"><a href="#para3-18" name="para3-18">3.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Blair confirmed that he did speak to Mr Prodi about Mr Murdoch&#8217;s proposed acquisition of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mediaset, but that the call had come from Mr Prodi himself and had not been initiated by Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Blair. He said he had asked about the proposed acquisition, and Mr Prodi had communicated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to him that he wanted an Italian purchaser for Mediaset. Mr Blair explained that he would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have done the same for anyone with substantial British interests:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref79" href="#footnote79">79</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;... the call was initiated from Romani Prodi, and basically I ... raised the issue of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whether the idea of having someone from the outside come and own part of Mediaset</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would be resented or not. He gave me an answer and I can&#8217;t remember how it was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relayed back, but I&#8217;m sure it was. But my point is that I would have done that for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">anyone with substantial British interests. I would have done that if another media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">group had asked me to do it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-19"><a href="#para3-19" name="para3-19">3.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his evidence, Mr Campbell quoted a contemporaneous No 10 briefing he had given on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue, and added:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref80" href="#footnote80">80</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The call from Prodi was not about [the proposed acquisition] ... It was about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">something completely different, and Prodi had asked for us not to brief on it... Rupert</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Murdoch had mentioned this company to the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as I recall &#8211; we did have a discussion about whether there was anything wrong in him</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">raising it. In the end he didn&#8217;t raise it until this phone call came along on something</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">else and he mentioned it and Prodi said words to the effect that Murdoch&#8217;s wasting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">his time and I don&#8217;t think it went any further&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-20"><a href="#para3-20" name="para3-20">3.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whether Mr Blair would have telephoned Mr Prodi to intervene on Mr Murdoch&#8217;s behalf</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had the latter not telephoned him first on another matter is unclear. In any event, taking full</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">account of the fact that Mr Murdoch was seeking very limited benefit from the intervention,</span>

<a name="page1147"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">what may be more important is what can be inferred from the fact that Mr Murdoch was able</span>

<p id="para-id-3-21"><a href="#para3-21" name="para3-21">3.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The war in Iraq was a landmark event in Mr Blair&#8217;s political fortunes. Some commentators<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref82" href="#footnote82">82</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have argued that Mr Blair&#8217;s decision to go to war in Iraq was influenced by Mr Murdoch&#8217;s firm</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and enthusiastic views on the subject. Mr Blair rejected that suggestion:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref83" href="#footnote83">83</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I disagree completely with Paul Dacre&#8217;s assertion over Iraq. I had a view about this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">issue. I was prepared to lose a vote and resign over it. I had taken a position since</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">9/11 to stand with the US. I strongly believed it was right to remove Saddam Hussein.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It is correct I spoke to Rupert Murdoch in the days leading up to the vote. I can&#8217;t recall</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at whose instigation. I would have obviously wanted to explain what I was doing and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">why to the Head of Media Group that was most disposed to support the action; but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I had long since made up my mind on it and the notion that I required &#8220;lobbying&#8221; by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">him or anyone else is plain wrong. And I have no doubt that the Mail would have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">attacked me whichever course I took&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-22"><a href="#para3-22" name="para3-22">3.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Blair was asked by the Inquiry about three telephone calls made on 11, 13 and 19 March</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2003 in the run up to the Iraq War. He said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref84" href="#footnote84">84</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Look, this is a huge issue, obviously. I mean, my recollection is that I initiated one</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of those calls. I actually remember only two, but the records show there were three,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">although I think they were no more than 45 minutes in total for all three. But you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know, I would have been wanting to explain what we were doing, and I did this &#8211; I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think I had similar calls with the Observer and the Telegraph, and indeed I had a lunch</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">later with the Guardian. So you know, I think that&#8217;s &#8211; it&#8217;s not &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t say there&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">anything particularly unusual or odd about that when you&#8217;re facing such a huge issue.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Now none of these calls was particularly long, but they were important... I think with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">him, probably, I would also have been asking him what the situation was in the US, for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">example, in Australia, which were also major parts of the coalition. But no, it would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not have been about the tone of the coverage. I mean, look, they were supportive of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it and that was that&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-23"><a href="#para3-23" name="para3-23">3.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although Mr Blair did not have a clear recollection of the precise content of these calls (and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nor did Mr Murdoch when asked about them), it is interesting that he made time to discuss</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these issues with a newspaper proprietor speaking from the USA. It is also interesting that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch&#8217;s 173 newspapers worldwide all supported the war.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-24"><a href="#para3-24" name="para3-24">3.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Blair explained that although he had considered throughout</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">his period of office that, while he had views about press conduct and standards, addressing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them was not a priority, by the time he had come to the end of his term as Prime Minister he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had concluded that the issue had become far more pressing.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref85" href="#footnote85">85</a></sup> On 12 June 2007, approximately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">two weeks before leaving office, Mr Blair gave a speech on<span style="font-style:italic"> Public</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Life</span> to the Reuters Institute</span>

<a name="page1148"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">of Journalism, in which he made some trenchant criticisms of the press, famously describing</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">at least sections of the industry as &#8216;feral beasts&#8217;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-25"><a href="#para3-25" name="para3-25">3.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He made four specific points:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref86" href="#footnote86">86</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The media is increasingly and to a dangerous degree driven by &#8216;impact&#8217;... First,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">scandal or controversy beats ordinary reporting hands down. News is rarely news</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">unless it generates heat as much as or more than light. Second, attacking motive</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is far more potent than attacking judgment. It is not enough for someone to have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">made an error of judgment. It has to be venal. Conspiratorial ... But misconduct is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what has impact. Third, the fear of missing out means today&#8217;s media, more than ever</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">before, hunts in a pack. In these modes it is like a feral beast, just tearing people and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reputations to bits. But no one dares miss out. Fourth, rather than just report news,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">even if sensational or controversial, the new technique is commentary on the news</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">being as, if not more important, than the news itself&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-26"><a href="#para3-26" name="para3-26">3.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He suggested that the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> relationship</span><span style="font-style:italic"> between</span><span style="font-style:italic"> public</span><span style="font-style:italic"> life</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> media</span><span style="font-style:italic"> [was]</span><span style="font-style:italic"> ...</span><span style="font-style:italic"> now</span><span style="font-style:italic"> damaged</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">remained accountable, and that serious concerns about unbalanced reporting would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">addressed in the future. He noted that broadcasting, for example, was regulated by Ofcom.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref87" href="#footnote87">87</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-27"><a href="#para3-27" name="para3-27">3.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The speech was almost universally criticised by the press itself. The Daily Telegraph on 13</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">June 2007,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref88" href="#footnote88">88</a></sup> carried a headline &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Blair&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Last</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Enemy:</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Freedom</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Speech</span> &#8221; above an article</span>

<h2>4. Prime Minister Brown: 2007 &#8211; 2010</h2>

<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP was Prime Minister between 27 June 2007 and 11 May 2010.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Brown was asked to comment on the strategy New Labour adopted in the mid-1990s; he</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref96" href="#footnote96">96</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">&#8220;Myeffortsweretopersuadeeverymediagroupthatwhatweweredoingwasserious.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Look, we were trying to rebuild the National Health Service, improve our education</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">system, get more police onto the street, legislate for freedom of information. We had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">agendas on civil liberties, on issues like gay partnerships. All these issues, you needed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to have an understanding, at least, on the part of the media, and you needed to talk</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to them. As for any particular media group, I don&#8217;t think I was involved in any sort of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">way that I would feel uncomfortable about now with any particular media group at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">all.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Brown said that he had few dealings with Rupert Murdoch at this stage, and by implication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that close engagement with the press was left to others.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref97" href="#footnote97">97</a></sup> He also stated that he had no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involvement in what he called the &#8216;particular issue&#8217; of winning the support of The Sun in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">March 1997.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref98" href="#footnote98">98</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Brown said that he had intended from the start of his premiership to set a new tone in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government&#8217;s relationship with the press. He explained that he was concerned to ensure fair</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">access to Government, including by meeting regularly with all media groups without giving</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">preferential treatment to anyone.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Brown&#8217;s evidence, however, was that he faced a hostile press almost from the very outset,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that the hostility came to be of a very personal nature. Lord Mandelson said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref99" href="#footnote99">99</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Mr. Brown comes in and he has good, rather easy relations with the media. It didn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">last, as we know. It took a very significant dive&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Brown described his initial approach:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref100" href="#footnote100">100</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;When I came in in 2007, we had no mandate in our manifesto to propose reform</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the media. I did want to make a change, and I did try to move away from what I</span>

<a name="page1150"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">thought was the excessive dominance of what is called the lobby system, and what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">really has led to these allegations of spin &#8230; I tried to move away from that.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">One, we moved away from having a political chief of communications to having a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">civil servant doing the job. That was to send a message that we were not trying to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">politicise government information; we were trying to give the information that was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">necessary for the public to understand what was happening.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We then tried to move back to a system where announcements were made in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Parliament. They were not pre-briefed, they were made in Parliament, and therefore</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that moved away from a system where, to be honest, there were a selected group</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of people who previously could expect to get early access to information, and I think</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that&#8217;s been a problem with the way the media system has worked, but I&#8217;m afraid it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was wholly unsuccessful, and I see that the current government have moved back to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">having a political appointee &#8230; and the lobby system remains intact. It&#8217;s not the lobby</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">system per se that&#8217;s the problem, it&#8217;s this small group of insiders who get the benefit</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of early access to information, and I think that is one of the problems that prevents</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the greater openness that we have to see.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8230; The changes that eventually we tried to make we didn&#8217;t make successfully I&#8217;m afraid</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">because there was a huge resistance to them, and to be honest, if you announce</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">something in Parliament or announced it in a speech, it was not being reported.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Unless it had been given as an exclusive to a newspaper, they tended to put in on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">page 6, rather than page 1.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In relation to changes to the lobby system, Mr Boulton commented:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref101" href="#footnote101">101</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;... Under the Brown and Cameron governments there has been a concerted attempt</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by press colleagues to use the Lobby system to constrain their competitors in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">electronic media by imposing artificial embargos on information given in order to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">benefit print deadlines. This practice is particularly irksome on foreign trips in different</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">time zones and has resulted in several calls to ban Sky News for allegedly breaking</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the rules. Downing Street habitually takes the side of print on the pathetic ground</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that &#8216;we&#8217;ve got to give the hacks something to justify the cost of the trip.&#8217;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-7"><a href="#para4-7" name="para4-7">4.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In June 2007 the personal relationship between Mr Brown and Mr Murdoch was said to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">close, and appears to have become so over the preceding years. However, by September</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2009 it had cooled, associated with a shift in political support in The Sun. As Lord Mandelson</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref102" href="#footnote102">102</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q: You presumably detected that shift in support, which was gradual, from Mr.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Brown to Mr. Cameron; is that right?</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: Yes. That was during 2009. Yes, during the course of that year.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q: Had you seen signs of it the previous year in 2008?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: It was hard not to get Rebekah Wade, or Brooks, as she became, to wax eloquent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about the inequities of Gordon Brown and the so-called coup against Tony Blair. She</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had strong views. I remember on one occasion ... she tipped into this great tirade</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">against Gordon and these others who had brought Tony down and whatever, and</span>

<p id="para-id-4-8"><a href="#para4-8" name="para4-8">4.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Mandelson&#8217;s focus was on the personalities involved, but Mr Brown chose to emphasise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what he called NI&#8217;s public agenda:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref103" href="#footnote103">103</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;News International had a public agenda. What&#8217;s remarkable about what happened</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the period of 2009 and 2010 is that News International moved away from being</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; I think it was under James Murdoch&#8217;s influence, not so much Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">influence, if I may say so &#8211; to having an aggressive public agenda ... I don&#8217;t think I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had a conversation with Mrs. Brooks in the last &#8211; I think I had one conversation in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the last nine months of our government. It became very clear in the summer of 2009,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">when Mr. Murdoch junior gave the MacTaggart lecture, that News International had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a highly politicised agenda for changes that were in the media policy of this country,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and there seemed to me to be very little point in talking to them about this&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-9"><a href="#para4-9" name="para4-9">4.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In terms of his personal relationship with Mr Brown, Mr Murdoch expressed the matter in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref104" href="#footnote104">104</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wife and his also developed a friendship, and my children and his played together... I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">certainly thought we had a warm personal relationship.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">My personal feelings about Mr. Brown did not change my view that, just as I had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">earlier concluded that the Conservative Party had grown tired in its approach in 1995,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I concluded in 2010 after 13 years of Labour Party rule the country needed a change.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I am afraid that my personal relationship with Mr. Brown suffered after The Sun no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">longer supported him politically. I continue to hold him in high personal esteem.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Brown&#8217;s evidence was as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref105" href="#footnote105">105</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q: Mr. Murdoch himself describes a warm relationship he had with you. Is this a fair</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">characterisation?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: Yeah,IthinkthesimilarbackgroundmadeitinterestingbecauseIthinkIunderstood</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">where many of his views came from, and I do also think he&#8217;s been, as I said ... a very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">successful businessman, and his ability to build up a newspaper and media empire,</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not just in Australia but in two other continents, in America and Europe, is something</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that is not going to be surpassed easily by any other individual. But I think you have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to distinguish again between the views that you have about him as an individual and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the red line that I would draw, the line in the sand I talked about, between that and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any support for commercial interests ...&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q: Were you not concerned at ... the signs of The Sun moving away from you to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">support the Tory Party?</span>

<a name="page1152"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: I think that happened from the time I became Prime Minister. I&#8217;ll be honest. I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think they had severe reservations that were expressed in the European campaign,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Broken Britain campaign, their Afghanistan campaign, and I think, as I said, also</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there was a new agenda that Mr. James Murdoch was promoting about the future</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the media policy in Britain. So I was not surprised at all when The Sun &#8211; I was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">perhaps surprised about the way they did it ... but the act of deciding to go with the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Conservatives, I think, had been planned over many, many months.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-11"><a href="#para4-11" name="para4-11">4.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On a personal level, Mr Brown was also quite close to Mrs Brooks and his wife, Sarah, was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described as a good friend. In the context of coverage of his son&#8217;s medical condition, which is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered above,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref106" href="#footnote106">106</a></sup> Mrs Brooks explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref107" href="#footnote107">107</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had ever said anything &#8211; that he was in any way concerned about my behaviour, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">behaviour of the Sun, how we handled it. Indeed, after 2006, I continued to see them</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">both regularly. They held a 40th birthday celebration party for me. They attended my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wedding. I have many letters and kind notes. Sarah and I were good friends...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-12"><a href="#para4-12" name="para4-12">4.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Neither Mr Brown nor Mr Murdoch accepted that their relationship had been &#8216;too close&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">during Mr Brown&#8217;s time as Prime Minister, nor that NI had provided support for Mr Brown</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or his Government in its newspapers on the express or implied basis that the company&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commercial interests would be safeguarded or wider political agendas espoused. Asked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about this, and whether there could even have been legitimate concerns about perception,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Brown told the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref108" href="#footnote108">108</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;No, because the implication is that I would be influenced by Mr. Murdoch was saying</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about these big issues. I mean, I thought that it was wrong to join the euro ... but I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">didn&#8217;t agree with him on most of these other issues, and the idea that Mr. Murdoch</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and I had a common bond in policy is, I&#8217;m afraid, not correct. Mr. Murdoch was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">probably more on the flat tax school of policy than in the school of policy that was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">identified with what we were doing.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I have never asked a newspaper for their support directly and I&#8217;ve never complained</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">when they haven&#8217;t given us their support. I don&#8217;t think you should be dependent on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people by begging them to support you in this way, and perhaps it&#8217;s a failing on my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">part that I never asked them directly, but I never asked them directly and I never</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">complained to them directly when they withdrew support from the Labour Party&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">blurring of relationship boundaries between the personal and the conduct of public affairs.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commentators such as Mr Boulton spoke of this in extremely critical terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref109" href="#footnote109">109</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister&#8217;s wife and a senior proprietor&#8217;s wife&#8221;,</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">social circumstances or awkward social circumstances which we perhaps have been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recruited for, which we didn&#8217;t seek out but we&#8217;ve ended up in.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-14"><a href="#para4-14" name="para4-14">4.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Brown described himself as having been unfairly and personally hurt by an attack in The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sun following the publication of a handwritten letter he had sent to the mother of a soldier</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">killed in Afghanistan. Email correspondence between Mr Brown and Mr Murdoch ensued,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref110" href="#footnote110">110</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">following a telephone conversation which took place on or about 10 November 2009.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref111" href="#footnote111">111</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-15"><a href="#para4-15" name="para4-15">4.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of commentators have suggested that Mr Brown had enjoyed a close relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre and that, although their political perspectives differed, they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">shared similar values. About that he said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref112" href="#footnote112">112</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. I didn&#8217;t see Mr Dacre that much, as you can see from the records. Mr Dacre and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I disagreed about many things on politics. I think he, like me, believes that there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should be an ethical basis for any political system and that that is an issue that is not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">properly addressed both in our media and in our politics, so there is sort of common</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ground on that, even though we may disagree about what that means in practice.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He was personally very kind, as Rupert Murdoch could be personally very kind, when</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we had difficulties with our child, our first child, and I have not forgotten that. But to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be honest, I got no support from the Daily Mail. The Daily Mail was totally against</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Labour Party, and when it came to the election, you may see that I had a meeting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with Lord Rothermere, as I talked to Paul Dacre, and I said, &#8220;Look, you&#8217;re entering a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">situation where you have a party that&#8217;s got a relationship with the Murdoch empire</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and their commercial interests and you should be very wary of it&#8221;, and I did warn</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">them that that was one of the problems that was going to happen.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Some have said, including Mr Alastair Campbell, that the Daily Mail was less</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hostile to you personally when you were chancellor, owing in part to your position on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the euro. Do you think that&#8217;s a fair comment or not?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I don&#8217;t know whether it was. Look, one of the huge dividing lines in British politics</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">over the past 10 years has been the euro. Most of the newspapers, of course, were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">against it. I was in a minority within our government for a very long period of time of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">being sceptical about the euro. My colleague, Ed Balls, who was the economic adviser</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the Treasury at the time and was later a Member of Parliament, did this enormous</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">amount of work that proved to my satisfaction that the euro couldn&#8217;t work, but it</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was a hugely divisive issue. But if the Daily Mail supported the objections that I had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the euro, then that&#8217;s absolutely understandable, but I&#8217;m afraid to say on just about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">every other issue they were wholly against us and they wanted to see a Conservative</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">government, as you know.&#8221;</span>

<a name="page1154"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q: Did he become an ally of Mr. Dacre or vice versa?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: He was, much to our astonishment, incredibly close to Mr. Dacre. I&#8217;m not saying</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that it&#8217;s wrong to be a friend of Mr. Dacre; I too sometimes enjoyed Mr. Dacre&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">company. I enjoyed his company more than his treatment of me in his newspapers.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">But he &#8211; Gordon and Paul Dacre had a great friendship and I remember Paul Dacre</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">describing to me the virtues of Mr. Brown in contrast to Mr. Blair in fairly graphic</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">terms. And that continued, actually. Even when Gordon, as Prime Minister was, you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know, having a really tough time, you know, following the financial crash and what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">happened to our economy as a result of the financial crash, and the Mail and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mail on Sunday would be laying into the Labour government left, right and centre,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there was always an element, an element, of laying off Mr. Brown and so I think that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">friendship continued.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q: Did that friendship, in your view, have any influence on Mr. Brown&#8217;s political and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">policy thinking, particularly in the context of Europe?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: I think Mr. Dacre&#8217;s influence in their friendship would have accentuated his cooling</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on Europe and the single currency, but that was by no means the only influence. A far</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">greater influence would have been his economic adviser and minister throughout the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">period, Ed Balls...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q: Do you think Mr. Brown had an eye on the Daily Mail, Mr. Dacre&#8217;s view, in terms</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of policies for which he was responsible?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: As Prime Minister, he was responsible, in a sense, for all policies. I&#8217;m not sure.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">In mean, the only thing I can vaguely remember was something to do with data</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">protection. There was an issue to do with data protection.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-17"><a href="#para4-17" name="para4-17">4.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Brown was asked a number of questions about alleged anonymous briefings to journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which it was put to him were in fact given by Charles Whelan and Damian McBride, who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">worked for him as his special advisors, the former until 1999 and the latter until April 2009.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Brown denied that they gave any such briefings, or that if they did so it was without his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">knowledge or sanction.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref114" href="#footnote114">114</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Many political commentators have expressed surprise at this evidence. The current Leader of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Opposition has said that the reason Mr Whelan left his position was &#8216;because of the style</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of his operation&#8217;, and that he had raised a specific concern with Mr Brown about some of Mr</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">A thread running through a quantity of the evidence to the Inquiry about the relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between politicians and the press was the issue of the extent to which politicians attempted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to affect (or, put less neutrally, to manipulate) press coverage in their favour, not this time</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the level of personal interactions or potential interchanges of influence, but simply by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seeking to control what information is released about their thoughts and plans, when, how</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and to whom.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is an issue of interest to the Inquiry, first because it offers the prospect of insight into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the dynamics of the relationship and, in particular, where power lies. To the extent that a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politician can control the news agenda he or she is in a position of relative dominance in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the relationship. It is also of wider interest from the viewpoint of the general public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because it has a potential to affect the clarity with which the public can understand what is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">going on and the ability of political journalists to do their job of promoting free debate and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">holding power to account. It has a potential to have results which are partial, misleading,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">distorted or placed out of context. On the other hand, it also has the opposite potential,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">namely to counteract whatever tendencies might exist in the press to drive the political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">agenda, if not public opinion, in any particular direction.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-3"><a href="#para5-3" name="para5-3">5.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is an issue which is accordingly very hard to deal with objectively. It largely comes down</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to a matter of standpoint. It is therefore dealt with relatively briefly in this Report. I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nevertheless concluded that there are some interesting patterns which can be picked out,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and perhaps one or two lessons which can be drawn.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-4"><a href="#para5-4" name="para5-4">5.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The issue probably owes its contemporary prominence to the critique of &#8216;spin&#8217; associated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the news management techniques of Lord Mandelson and Mr Campbell.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref117" href="#footnote117">117</a></sup> Both, when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">invited by the Inquiry to do so, painted a picture instead of a need to counteract unfair press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hostility.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-5"><a href="#para5-5" name="para5-5">5.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Campbell&#8217;s role was certainly one that trod new ground in the history of relations between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians in Government and the press. Some commentators described it as a wholly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different approach to the imparting and presentation of information from Government.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Others take a longer view. The Rt Hon Michael Gove MP was able to remind the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of historical parallels with the Roman Republic.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref118" href="#footnote118">118</a></sup> Lord Mandelson suggested that the first</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;spin doctor&#8217; was appointed by Clement Atlee, and that Baroness Thatcher&#8217;s press spokesman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when she was Prime Minister, Sir Bernard Ingham, was as high profile and controversial as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Campbell.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref119" href="#footnote119">119</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-6"><a href="#para5-6" name="para5-6">5.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir John Major provided the Inquiry with an illuminating perspective on these issues:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref120" href="#footnote120">120</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Now, we&#8217;ve had political spin forever. Every politician since the dawn of time will</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">put a gloss on something to ensure that it is presented in the best possible light.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We&#8217;ve all done it. Everyone does that. But I think there is a distinction between a gloss</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and a deliberate attempt to deceive in the way in which the news is presented, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my concern was that once you move towards the politicisation of the government</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information services, which is what it was, you did move into a sphere where the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">media at large.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think you also saw some other things which journalists are better able to talk about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">than I, but that they&#8217;ve certainly mentioned to me: people being given stories when</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other people weren&#8217;t and presenting them with a particular tilt, so that when the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">story hit the public news, immediately it had a favourable tilt for the government</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rather than a neutral or perhaps even a deservedly unfavourable tilt. A whole range</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of things like that, which I&#8217;m sure this Inquiry has heard about, so I won&#8217;t tediously</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">run through them all. But in short, I think the straightforward, clear cut certainty of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an honest presentation of policy from the information service that was there when</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you had civil servants presenting it on behalf of the government was lost when you</span>

<h3>The New Labour perspective</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-7"><a href="#para5-7" name="para5-7">5.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As indicated above, on 27 July 1994, Mr Blair appointed Mr Campbell to be his press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">spokesman and jointly responsible with Lord Mandelson for election strategy.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref121" href="#footnote121">121</a></sup> It was put</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Mr Campbell that Mr Blair&#8217;s memoirs had referred in terms to the value of appointing a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">tabloid editor,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref122" href="#footnote122">122</a></sup> an assessment which he only partly accepted:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref123" href="#footnote123">123</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;No, what he said to me when [he] finally approached me was that he wanted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">somebody that was strategic, that understood the press and that would be able to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">do the job that he wanted done. So I don&#8217;t recall it being particularly he wanted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">somebody who was from the tabloids, but he wanted somebody that kind of knew</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that world.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-8"><a href="#para5-8" name="para5-8">5.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Blair&#8217;s own perspective was as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref124" href="#footnote124">124</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I cannot believe we are the first and only government that has ever wanted to put</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the best possible gloss on what you&#8217;re doing. I would be surprised if governments</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hadn&#8217;t done that throughout the ages. That is a completely different thing from saying</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that you go out to say that things that are deliberately untrue or you bully or harass</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalists and so on. I read a lot of things we are supposed to have done. I actually</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">dispute we did those things, very, very strongly. My view is this: I totally understand</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">why there&#8217;s a kind of symmetry in being able to say, &#8220;Oh, well, the government was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">spinning and so the media had to react to that&#8221;. In my view &#8211; but you can take a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">different one &#8211; that&#8217;s not what happened.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I mean, the truth is, in 1992 Alastair Campbell wasn&#8217;t heard of. If you look at the way</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that election was covered &#8211; and by the time I took over the leadership of the Labour</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Party, we&#8217;d lost four elections in a row. We&#8217;d actually never won two consecutive full</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">elections in our history. The longest we&#8217;d ever been in power was six years at one go.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So &#8211; I went through that election. I remember it. It was etched on my memory and yes,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I was absolutely determined that we should not be subject to the same onslaught.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Mandelson was asked directly about his news management strategy and the label of</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">&#8216;spin&#8217;. His explanation was as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref125" href="#footnote125">125</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think &#8216;spin&#8217; is a derogatory term. I mean, what we determined to do, really from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the time that Tony Blair became leader of the Labour Party in 1994, was to speak as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">far as possible with a consistent voice, and to &#8211; perhaps to go back to your earlier</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">question, to try to ensure that the media understood what it was that we were trying</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to achieve. So yes, I mean, there was more discipline about what we said, how we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">said it, who we said it to, than there certainly had been through the many years of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Labour in opposition.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q: Did it lead to a breakdown of trust between the public on the one hand and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">politicians on the other?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: I don&#8217;t think it was &#8211; I don&#8217;t think it was that that led to a breakdown of trust in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the public. I do think that we were always too reliant on the support of newspapers,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and I think that in the context of everything I&#8217;ve said earlier ... our expectations were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">too high of the degree to which the government&#8217;s story could be conveyed through</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the newspapers.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-10"><a href="#para5-10" name="para5-10">5.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Campbell&#8217;s personal, retrospective evaluation was that the critique of &#8216;spin&#8217; was itself a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">symptom of the problem which he thought he faced, and that suggestions that the quality of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public discourse was corroded were rarely supported by evidence:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref126" href="#footnote126">126</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I can remember, for example, one briefing where, at the end of yet another frenzy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and journalists accusing me of lying and the politicians then getting roped in saying</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I should resign &#8211; I can remember saying to all the journalists there in the room:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Right, come on, just say what the lie is and then provide any evidence whatsoever&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">And they never could! So just &#8211; that in itself is a form of spin. You sent me Peter</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Oborne&#8217;s essay that he did for the British Journalism Review. &#8220;Most lobby journalists</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">[he said] have been deliberately misled or lied to by Downing Street&#8221;. Followed by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">zero evidence whatsoever. &#8220;New Labour&#8217;s culture of deception or manipulation of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">statistics, secretive smear campaigns....&#8221; No evidence whatsoever.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-11"><a href="#para5-11" name="para5-11">5.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Campbell was also asked about Lord Mandelson&#8217;s views:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref127" href="#footnote127">127</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q: Lord Mandelson, one of his concluding observations &#8211; ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There was a great emphasis on managing the media at the expense of managing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">policy. There was a sense that if you&#8217;d got the story right, you&#8217;d achieved something</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and that&#8217;s not how government is.&#8221; Do you think there&#8217;s any validity in that comment?</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: No. I think the policy process was always taken more seriously, but I think we all</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">spent far too much time focussed on &#8211; and I speak as the guy who was in charge if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this. The politicians spent way too much time worrying about this stuff.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Interestingly, there are perhaps echoes of this in Mr Cameron&#8217;s public statements in April</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2012 about wider failings in politics: the concentration on presentation over the content of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the message itself.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref128" href="#footnote128">128</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-13"><a href="#para5-13" name="para5-13">5.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Blair&#8217;s evidence was along similar lines. He accepted that there were problems in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">carrying over of the techniques of Opposition into Government. He also accepted that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Campbell was somewhat of a &#8216;combative figure&#8217;. Asked about whether there had in fact been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bullying or intimidating of journalists, or alternatively the favouring of certain journalists, Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Blair stated:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref129" href="#footnote129">129</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;If you take someone like Andrew Marr, who is a very good journalist, I would be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">astonished if he felt that he&#8217;d been bullied or intimidated. If he did feel that, then I&#8217;m</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sorry about it, and I certainly wouldn&#8217;t have known about it. .... But I suspect he is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">feeding back this thing that has grown up. You know &#8211; and also, some of these issues</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are different. For example, there will always be an interaction with the newspapers. If</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you&#8217;re going to launch a major campaign, and let&#8217;s say there&#8217;s a particular newspaper</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that&#8217;s been interested in this type of campaign &#8211; let&#8217;s say you were going to do a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">big thing on anti-social behaviour. It would make sense to talk to the Mirror, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Sun, maybe, about that. We probably, in the later part, would have hesitated before</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">talking to some of the papers that were utterly hostile for fear of the fact that you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would simply have the story distorted in some way, so maybe that gives rise to that.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Briefing against people &#8211; I just want to make this clear: I couldn&#8217;t abide that. If I ever</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">thought anyone was doing it, I would be absolutely down on them like a ton of bricks.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I remember, for example, stories &#8211; I remember there were a lot of prominent stories</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at a certain point in time in relation to the late Mo Mowlam, and how I was very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">angry because she got a standing ovation at a party conference and we were briefing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">against her ... It was completely untrue.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q: I think the thesis being advanced is that the masters of the dark arts, whether</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they be Lord Mandelson or Alastair Campbell, tended to pick on junior reporters or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">producers... and let off people like Mr. Marr himself.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: No, that&#8217;s my point, really, that in the end they receive this as sort of second-hand</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; look, I have no doubt that we used to complain strongly if we thought that stories</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were wrong. You know, I think that&#8217;s perfectly legitimate. But I always felt &#8211; and I&#8217;m</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">probably not the right person to be objective about this at all &#8211; but I always felt that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">their actual pushback against us was because for the first time, the Labour Party ran</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a really effective media operation, where we were able &#8211; and also, by the way, we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were in circumstances where, for the first time politically, the Labour Party was able</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to go on and win successive elections. As I said earlier, we&#8217;d never won two successive</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">first terms, never mind three, and I felt you had to have a strong media operation, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I completely dispute that it was part of that to go and brief against ministers&#8221;.</span>

<a name="page1159"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. If, as I think you are not, you are not accepting even a kernel of truth in a thesis</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which may be exaggerated, how is it that this mythology has built up around you that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people like Lord Mandelson, Mr Campbell, at your instigation, were the masters of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">these so-called dark arts?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. It&#8217;s got to the point where I almost hesitate to dispute it with you, because I know</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">these people just say, &#8220;Oh, how dare he dispute the fact that actually they were out</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">using black arts and briefing against this person and that person?&#8221; The fact is, you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know, I never authorised or said to someone: &#8220;Go out and brief against&#8221; &#8211; I hate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that type of stuff. It&#8217;s the lowest form of politics. It&#8217;s just a complete diversion from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">everything that is important. Now, I don&#8217;t doubt, by the way &#8211; look, in any system you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">will have people that will say things or do things or brief things that they shouldn&#8217;t be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">doing, but I simply say to you my view is that the &#8211; what I think a part of the media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">felt &#8211; and this is the odd thing, and I used to comment on this sometimes &#8211; is that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the outside world, when you&#8217;re Prime Minister, you seem as if you&#8217;re all powerful,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and for that first period of our time in government, it looked as if we were carrying in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">everything. You know, the opposition were very poor, we didn&#8217;t just win one landslide,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we then went on to win two, and I think part of the media frankly felt we were far</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">too powerful, we had to be taken on and curbed and so on. But, you know, in relation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to this stuff with black arts, look, I don&#8217;t &#8211; I don&#8217;t know whether Peter was doing it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or Alastair was doing it, but if they &#8211; all I know is that my interactions with them,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we were aware that you start doing all that stuff, all it does is blow back on you. I&#8217;m</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a real believer in this regard that what goes around comes around. So for me, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">important thing was to have a strong effective media operation. I think that what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Alastair produced for us in Downing Street was that, but I think it was a perfectly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proper media operation.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. I&#8217;m really coming back to the point about the draining of the poison, and perhaps</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who is responsible for the implantation of the poison. If one focuses too much on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press, it might be said that one is arguably missing the wrong target. How about this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as a possibility: we might have now a poisonous state of affairs which is a contribution</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">really of both sides to this equation &#8211; the press on the one hand, the political classes</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the other &#8211; and accidentally or unwittingly, they&#8217;ve created something which has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">grown beyond either of their contributions. Is that a possible analysis?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Look, it&#8217;s certainly a possible analysis, and I&#8217;m not saying we don&#8217;t bear any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">responsibility for this situation &#8211; don&#8217;t misunderstand me &#8211; as a political class, but I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think if I&#8217;m frank about it, the primary responsibility is not having confronted it and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">dealt with it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-15"><a href="#para5-15" name="para5-15">5.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Brown offered this perspective on his personal approach:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref131" href="#footnote131">131</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I did want to make a change, and I did try to move away from what I thought was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the excessive dominance of what is called the lobby system, and what really has led</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to those allegations of spin &#8211; by the way, spin assumes that you got success in getting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">your message across, even if it&#8217;s superficial and I don&#8217;t think anybody could accuse</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">me of having a great success in getting my message across. But I tried to move away</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">from that.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">One, we moved away from having a political chief of communications to having a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">civil servant doing the job. That was to send the message that we were not trying to</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref131" name="footnote131" title="Go back to footnote reference 131 in the text">131</a>.  pp21-22, lines 23-12, Gordon Brown, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-11-June-2012.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1160"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">politicise government information; we were trying to give the information that was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">necessary for the public to understand what was happening&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-16"><a href="#para5-16" name="para5-16">5.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Brown did suggest that there had been risks to the public interest in New Labour&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach to news management. Asked if there were any lessons to be learnt from the period</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1997 to 2010, he indicated:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref132" href="#footnote132">132</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Yes. We should have ... changed the system where people relied on exclusive briefings</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and had a far more transparent system of addressing the country through the press</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">than we have even today, and I obviously have to take some responsibility for this ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So yes, there needed to be more openness. We inherited a system which was based</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on, if you like, exclusivity. It was also based on insiders winning over outsiders, so a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">lot of people were excluded from that system&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-17"><a href="#para5-17" name="para5-17">5.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">From one standpoint, then, the priority of the politicians learning the lessons administered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to them by the press in the &#8216;wilderness years&#8217; of the 1980s and early 1990s was both to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">persuade the press that they had nothing to fear from a change of Government and to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reach the public in a less adversely mediated way. From another standpoint, this was at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expense of a breakdown of public trust engineered by political self-interest. For politicians</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">trying to manage the agenda, it was about getting a fair hearing; for journalists resisting the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">management of the agenda, it was about manipulation and favouritism. Neither standpoint</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is neutral or objective. In the relationship between press and politician, in circumstances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where political positions are not aligned there is a contest of wits (or megaphones) in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">each viewpoint seeks to outmanoeuvre the other in a contest to dominate the public debate.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sometimes that can benefit and enrich the public debate and a balanced perspective can</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">emerge. Sometimes it can have the opposite effect: the public is so overwhelmed by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">messages delivered by competing megaphones, it does not have the chance to sort the wheat</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the chaff or to discern the true kernel of the issue.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-18"><a href="#para5-18" name="para5-18">5.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If New Labour did not invent &#8216;spin&#8217;, it nevertheless found itself in an unprecedented place</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to news management as an agenda item in its own right. On the one hand, its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">election-winning strategy in 1997 explicitly had in mind the lessons to be learned from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recent past. On the other, there is an obvious question about the extent to which a media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strategy of &#8216;neutralising&#8217; those sections of the press which had been hostile to the party in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the 1980s and in the run-up to the 1992 general election became a victim of its own success,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and resulted in diminishing public confidence in political communications.</span>

<h3>The perspective of journalists and commentators</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-19"><a href="#para5-19" name="para5-19">5.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Andrew Marr offered this overview in his book &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> My</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Trade</span> &#8221;, from his long perspective of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">political journalism in the print media and more recently working for the BBC:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref133" href="#footnote133">133</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;... As trust crumbled, so did reporters&#8217; willingness to defer to the government. Tales of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">how New Labour had bullied junior reporters or producers spread through the warren</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of press gallery offices and between broadcasters&#8217; headquarters. The backlash was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">slow, but it came. By the end of Blair&#8217;s first two years, it was a badge of honour</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to be &#8216;bollocked&#8217; by Campbell or Mandelson, and to shout back just as loudly. The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">persistent attempts to dictate what should appear on a front page, or at the top of a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">running order, became infuriating and hardened journalistic hearts.</span>

<a name="page1161"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Even before the 1997 election it was obvious that Labour had spies tipping it off about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">running orders, script lines and correspondents being used for news programmes and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was attempting to ambush them before they went on air to get more favourable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">coverage. In lobby meetings, Alastair Campbell and others would single out and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ridicule the correspondents of editorially hostile newspapers ... Favoured reporters</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were given special treatment, just as their editors were made much of in Downing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Street and invited to weekends at Chequers.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">But political correspondents have a certain esprit de corps alongside their professional</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rivalry, and the cynical way in which some were favoured because they worked for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Rupert Murdoch, while others were sneered at because they worked for Conrad Black,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">disgusted many who worked for neither.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-20"><a href="#para5-20" name="para5-20">5.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In oral evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Marr was asked to expand on this final paragraph. He said</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref134" href="#footnote134">134</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think that a decision was taken that it was very important to keep the Murdoch</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">papers, so far as was possible &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t always possible &#8211; on side and to have a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">close relationship with their leading journalists and their leading reporters. They</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were inside of the tent, if you like, as were some Labour friendly newspapers too,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">while papers like the Daily Telegraph were indeed kept at arm&#8217;s length, made to feel</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">unwelcome. From time to time their correspondents like George Owens [sic] would be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mocked during lobby briefings. There was very much an attempt, I felt, to divide this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">core &#8211; this group of journalists into the favoured ones, the ones who were sort of part</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the project, almost, and the ones who were off in the wilderness.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-21"><a href="#para5-21" name="para5-21">5.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Peter Oborne, chief political commentator at the Daily Telegraph, also commented on this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue from his own perspective. He observed as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref135" href="#footnote135">135</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q: I&#8217;mgoing toreadtheopeningquotationofchapter 7ofyourbook...TheQuotation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is from Robert Shrimsley, who is the news editor of the Financial Times, and it reads:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;When I joined the lobby in 1992, I would abandon a story if Number 10 denied it. By</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the time I left, I sometimes felt justified in merely recording the denial at the bottom.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A: Yes.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q: How accurate a summary is that of the change in government communications</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">during that period?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: I completely agree with Mr. Shrimpley<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref136" href="#footnote136">136</a></sup> ... I felt that what was true &#8211; I think what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we had when New Labour emerged in power in 1997 was really a &#8211; what I&#8217;d call a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">new epistemology, which was that truth was really seen as something which served</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the purposes of government or the party in power. It wasn&#8217;t &#8211; the rigorously testable,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">empirical truth was of no interest &#8211; of a kind which would be of interest to this Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; was not of interest to New Labour spokesmen. They were interested in the truth as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it served their political purposes, and so that was a different definition of truth. That,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think, is what Mr. Shrimpley<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref137" href="#footnote137">137</a></sup> is referring to there that denials or assertions became</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">really an instrument of government rather than an instrument of telling the truth.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Simon Walters is the political editor of the Mail on Sunday, a position which he has held</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">since 1999. He has been a journalist since 1974 and a member of the lobby since 1983. In his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">written evidence, Mr Walters noted that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref138" href="#footnote138">138</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;DuringMr.Blair&#8217;sgovernment,muchenergywasdevotedtoensuringalldepartments</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were &#8216;on message&#8217; &#8211; repeating the Downing Street line on any given issue. From the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">point of view of the Government, this greater degree of political control makes sense.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">But it can be argued that this is not in the public interest or that of the media. For</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">example, if Number 10 is trying to cover up a politically embarrassing story, it is easier</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to do so if there is central control over the entire Whitehall media machine&#8221;.</span>

<h3>Reflections</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-23"><a href="#para5-23" name="para5-23">5.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This Chapter has focused on aspects of news management during the 13 years of the New</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Labour: insofar as it has become relevant to the Conservative Party and the Coalition, this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will be analysed in the course of Chapter 4. But precisely because more than one view is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">possible about the advantages and risks of news management techniques, particular care</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">must be exercised to ensure that the message &#8211; an encapsulation of the facts and policies</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which politicians of whichever party wish to share with the public &#8211; is not lost in distractions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the packaging.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-24"><a href="#para5-24" name="para5-24">5.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Once again, the substantive issues which remain are to do with public perception. If the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public do not have confidence in the politicians to provide a straight message even, where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary, warts and all and the public do not have confidence in the press to provide a fair</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(although not necessarily balanced or impartial) account, everybody in our democracy loses.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Holding power to account can be partisan, but if the public detect that it is not fair, one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way or the other, the consequent loss of faith will damage both politicians and the press.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, if &#8216;favoured&#8217; relationships and the transaction of exclusives play a prominent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">role in the presentation of issues or, on the other side, simple error is always portrayed as</span>
