<h2>1. Introduction and background</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In common with a number of politicians of his generation, the Rt Hon David Cameron MP</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has spent most of his adult life in politics. He began his political career working for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Conservative Party Research Department, before becoming a general political SpAd, first to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Norman Lamont at the Treasury (1992-1993) and then later to Michael Howard at the Home</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Office (1993-1994).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> During this period he witnessed first-hand the national press&#8217; treatment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of both Lord Kinnock and Sir John Major. He also forged numerous professional relationships</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with political journalists:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;&#8230;probably</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> terms</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> political</span><span style="font-style:italic"> journalists</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> got</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> know,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> would</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have said that was more related to the time when I was a special adviser, because I was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">dealing with political journalists then and some of them are still around today.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> In</span><span style="font-style:normal"> some</span><span style="font-style:normal"> cases,</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these became personal friendships.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The working life of Mr Cameron which was beyond politics was spent in the media. Between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1994 and 2001 he worked for Carlton Communications Plc (Carlton). There, his role involved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public affairs, Government relations, investor relations and communicating with the financial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> By his own account this was a period formative of his views on media policy and, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular, about television:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">&#8220;IwouldsaymytimeatCarltonprobablytaughtmemoreaboutthetelevisionindustry,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">about how it was regulated, and maybe we&#8217;ll come on to this, a lot of the views I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">formed about media, media policy, media regulation, the BBC &#8211; Carlton was quite</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a formative period because I was working for a big part of the British broadcasting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">industry, ITV effectively, and I formed a lot of views and opinions there which I still</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hold today&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron retained his interest in politics whilst at Carlton and was elected to Parliament</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as the member for Witney on 7 June 2001.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> This was the period of New Labour&#8217;s potent new</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media strategy. His close political ally and near contemporary, George Osborne, put it this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;&#8230;we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> came</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> political</span><span style="font-style:italic"> age</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8211;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> myself,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> David</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Cameron</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> others</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8211;during</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> political</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">perspective has therefore been informed by more than twenty years of political activity and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wide contact with national newspaper journalists, covering most of the period considered by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry in Module Three.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This subsection of the Report concentrates upon the relationship between Mr Cameron with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">national newspapers during the periods in which he was Leader of the Opposition and then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prime Minister. It considers how his media strategy developed in Opposition, including the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recruitment of Mr Coulson, and the gradual winning of widespread support in the national</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers, most notably The Sun&#8217;s dramatic abandonment of Gordon Brown in September</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2009. Was the switch in allegiance the product of a &#8216;deal&#8217; or did it have other origins? The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">diminution in Mr Cameron&#8217;s contacts with the media which followed the general election of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010 is explored, as are Mr Cameron&#8217;s own contacts with the national newspapers, especially</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their proprietors and senior executives. The emergence of the phone hacking scandal is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">traced, both as it affected Mr Coulson&#8217;s position as Director of Communications, and in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way that it led to the setting up of this Inquiry. Finally, Mr Cameron&#8217;s well known view that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians have become &#8220;too close&#8221; to the media is assessed.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2.  Mr Cameron&#8217;s relations with the press whilst Leader  of the Opposition</h2>


<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron was elected Leader of the Conservative Party on 6 December 2005 and thereby</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">became the Leader of the Opposition.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> He explained the inherent disadvantage which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Opposition parties face in getting their message across to a media which usually accords more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">priority to covering the Government of the country than it does to reporting the prospective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">policies of the Opposition. Consequently, he saw a particular need for Opposition politicians</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">carefully to develop their relations with the media:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;All politicians are keen to have the opportunity to explain the policies they advocate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but the media generally considers comments made by Ministers as more newsworthy.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">In Opposition, political parties operate on a much smaller scale and sometimes</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">struggle to gain media coverage. It is much more difficult to make the public aware</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the relevance and impact of Opposition policies. For obvious reasons, attention</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and focus is directed on the party or parties in power. Senior politicians in Opposition</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">therefore tend to have to focus even more on developing their relations with the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">media in order to get their message across. As I said in the Commons on 13 July 2011:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;As Leader of the Opposition, you spend quite a lot of time trying to persuade</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapers and others to support you, because you want to explain your policies,</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">your vision and what you are doing for the country.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The practical product of this analysis was a considerable effort on his part to engage with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media whilst in Opposition. In terms of scale, the effort was reflected in the sheer number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of meetings and interviews with the media which Mr Cameron had in Opposition: 1,404</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the four year, five month period from December 2005 to May 2010: an average of 26</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Conservative views, or could be persuaded to do so&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was some evidence that Mr Cameron&#8217;s approach to the media in the period between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">December 2005 and 2007 differed significantly from the period that followed. It was said that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron sought to establish a relationship with more distance and less deference to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media, with reference to Rupert Murdoch in particular. Recalling and interpreting the period,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Andrew Neil wrote in his evidence that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It is one of the ironies of the current state of relations between press and politicians</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that Mr Cameron did not set out to replicate a Blair/Brown style relationship with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Murdoch press. He told me not long after becoming Tory leader in 2005 that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he would not go cap-in-hand seeking Mr Murdoch&#8217;s blessing, denigrating Mr Blair&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decision to fly to the other side of the world in 1995 to parade before Mr Murdoch</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and his lieutenants. Rather he would transform the Tory party as he saw fit and, if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mr Murdoch liked what he saw, would happily accept his endorsement. But he would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not seek to ingratiate himself with the media tycoon or recreate the extensive and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">close nexus that existed between the Murdoch Empire and New Labour. This strategy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">lasted until the summer of 2007, by which time Mr Brown was the new Prime Minister</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and enjoying an (albeit brief) honeymoon with the British people so advantageous</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that there was a widespread expectation that he would go to the country in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">autumn and win. Mr Cameron, for his part, found himself friendless: the left-leaning</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press were rallying to Mr Brown while right-leaning newspapers were becoming</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">increasingly critical of the Tory leader and his modernising agenda. It was in this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">predicament &#8211; with a fourth defeat for the Tories staring them in the face &#8211; that Mr</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Cameron reached out for Mr Murdoch and his newspapers, with consequences that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are now being revealed and documented.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">George Eustice MP served as David Cameron&#8217;s Press Secretary for almost two and half years</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between May 2005 and October 2007. Not inconsistently with parts of Mr Neil&#8217;s evidence, he</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;When I was his press secretary, we pursued a strategy of quietly puncturing the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">over more support, but to start with there were certainly some in my office who were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">very keen on trying to do things completely differently and communicate much more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">through the Internet and what have you. I would say I was more cautious about that,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">thinking we wanted to work very hard on television, we should do what we could with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the newspapers, but I think that&#8217;s the way it was...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is worth pausing to note the early emphasis on television which has been retained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">throughout Mr Cameron&#8217;s leadership of the Conservative Party. The importance accorded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to television reflects the enormous reach which television has to mass audiences and its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">power to communicate political messages notwithstanding the duty of impartiality to which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">broadcasters are subject. It is one of a number of indicators that, whilst the support of national</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers remains very important to modern politicians, that importance has to be seen in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perspective relative to television and increasingly also to the internet.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron confirmed that he had wanted more distance and a different approach to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media. Significantly though, he recalled them as eliding into one another rather than being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">tried sequentially. Given the opportunity to respond to Mr Eustice&#8217;s observation, quoted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">above, he said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think parts of it are right, in that we did want to have this &#8211; we didn&#8217;t want to go</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">down the same route as everything Labour had done. We did want to have a bit more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">distance, but if you look at the record of the sort of meetings I was having and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rest of it, I was still, you know, flying off to meet proprietors and trying to win people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">over, so I don&#8217;t think it totally squares up that there was one approach that was tried</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and failed and then another approach. There&#8217;s slightly more elision between the two,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my reflection on it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron&#8217;s evidence that he had been trying to &#8220;win people over&#8221; (that is to say, build</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political support) from the time of his appointment is amply borne out by the record of his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meetings with the media. The record shows a modest increase in the frequency of meetings</span>

<h3>2007: The appointment of Andy Coulson</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whether or not the strategies employed by Mr Cameron merged or were distinct and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sequential, it is clear that by 2007 he was looking significantly to strengthen his media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operation. He explained that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;After my first year or so as Leader of the Party, it became increasingly clear that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Conservative Party needed a heavyweight media operator, someone who had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">operated at the highest levels and who knew how a newsroom was run...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The need to recruit a media heavyweight was attributed to the huge pressures upon modern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political media operations:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...I was looking for someone who was a big hitter, and I was looking for someone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who could really cope with the huge media pressure that you&#8217;re under, and tabloid</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">editors and leading executives on a tabloid newspaper I think do have &#8211; they bring</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">something that others wouldn&#8217;t, and so there wasn&#8217;t a particular wish list, but it was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">trying to get the right person with the right skills.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-12"><a href="#para2-12" name="para2-12">2.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">TheobjectwasnotsimplytoabsorbthepressuresbuttochangeandimprovetheConservative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Party&#8217;s media operation:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I had this very good guy, George Eustice, who was doing a good job. If I was going</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to bring someone in above him, I wanted somebody who really would be able to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">materially alter and improve the way we did things, particularly in the face of this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">massive pressure you face.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Self evidently, the appointee would need to be sympathetic to Conservative views as well</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as have very considerable experience in the media and particularly of operating successfully</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in an intensely pressured media environment. In practice there was a very small pool of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potential recruits. Yet Mr Coulson was not the only person considered for the post. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cameron recalled seeing at least four people personally about the position:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;How many people did I see? Obviously Guto Harri, who&#8217;s outed himself or been outed,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I did have conversations with him. There was someone senior from a broadsheet</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspaper. There was someone else very senior in the BBC. There was this tabloid</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">journalist...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-14"><a href="#para2-14" name="para2-14">2.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It was Mr Osborne who proposed that Mr Coulson should be approached. At first glance, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might be thought surprising that Mr Osborne should have made this particular suggestion.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As the editor of the News of the World (NoTW), Mr Coulson had been responsible for a</span>

<a name="page1168"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">Whilst it is true that the story also ran in the Sunday Mirror with a leader far less kind than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that contributed to by Mr Coulson, a reflection perhaps of the differing political perspectives</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the two titles, it is certainly impossible to regard the NoTW&#8217;s headline as helpful to Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Osborne.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup> As the author of the headline &#8220;HUG A HOODIE&#8221;, Mr Coulson had not helped Mr</span>

<p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The most that could be said about the stance of the NoTW on Mr Cameron&#8217;s bid for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">leadership of the Conservative Party was that it had not been against him. More generally,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although the paper had engaged William Hague as a columnist between December 2003 and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2005, when he returned to the Shadow Cabinet, the NoTW under Mr Coulson had supported</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">New Labour, backing Mr Blair at the 2005 general election.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup> The importance of Mr Coulson</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Labour Party is well illustrated by the fact that when Mr Coulson resigned from his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">position as editor of the NoTW in 2007 both Mr Blair and Gordon Brown contacted him to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commiserate with him on the turn of events.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-16"><a href="#para2-16" name="para2-16">2.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That Mr Coulson had resigned in response to the conviction and imprisonment of one of his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists added yet another reason to question why it was that Mr Coulson&#8217;s name came to</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Mr Osborne&#8217;s mind.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-17"><a href="#para2-17" name="para2-17">2.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Osborne&#8217;s explanation for suggesting Mr Coulson to Mr Cameron was that he sensed that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coulson was in fact instinctively sympathetic to Conservative views:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...I had met Mr Coulson on a handful of previous occasions when he was editor of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">News of the Word, although we had not met privately before. Under his editorship the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspaper had supported the Labour Party in the previous general election. However,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in my conversations with him, I had sensed that his personal view of political issues</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was more closely aligned with the Conservatives &#8211; although I had never asked him as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">editor whether he was someone who had voted Conservative.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-18"><a href="#para2-18" name="para2-18">2.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On this point Mr Osborne&#8217;s intuition proved to be correct.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup> The circumstances in which Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Coulson had come to resign did not deter Mr Osborne from advocating an approach to Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Coulson because he assumed that the matter had been fully investigated by the police and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in any event, he could ask Mr Coulson about it:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I was, of course, aware from media reports that Mr Coulson had resigned as editor</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the News of the World following the convictions of the paper&#8217;s Royal correspondent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire for phone hacking. I assumed</span>

<p id="para-id-2-19"><a href="#para2-19" name="para2-19">2.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He thought that as a recently resigned editor of the NoTW, Mr Coulson would be a very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strong candidate for the task which was envisaged, explaining:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;... First of all, he had been the editor of a major national newspaper, so he had an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enormous amount of professional experience, and what we needed was someone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who was going to be able to handle the communications of a large organisation,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Conservative Party, and develop a media strategy, but also be able to handle, on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an hour by hour basis, the problems that were thrown at us ... I thought that Andy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Coulson had that experience, as someone who had run a large newsroom, was used</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the pressure of dealing with fast-changing stories.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-20"><a href="#para2-20" name="para2-20">2.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Osborne denied that Mr Coulson&#8217;s associations with or contacts with News International</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were relevant factors, whilst emphasising that his experience as the editor of a big newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and prospects of succeeding in the new role were:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Are you saying that his associations with or contacts with News International</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were not relevant factors at all?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">They were not relevant as far as I was concerned, or certainly, as far as I&#8217;m aware,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">David Cameron was concerned. The fact that he had edited a big newspaper was the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relevant fact, and as I say, the other candidates we considered were not people who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were working for News International. I think if Mr Coulson had, for example, been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">editing the Mail on Sunday, then we would have also hired him. So I think it wasn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relevant that he was a News International ex-employee.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: But relevant that he was very experienced in the ways of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">press?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. That was the relevance, sir. I mean, I have seen people suggest that the reason we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hired him was because of his connections with the Murdochs or Rebekah Brooks or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">his knowledge of the internal workings of News International. I can tell you that was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not a consideration. What we were interested in hiring is someone who was going to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">do the job going forward ...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-21"><a href="#para2-21" name="para2-21">2.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron had a similar, although not identical, view about the relevance of Mr Coulson&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News International background. He was at pains to say that there was no calculation that a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">former News International editor would facilitate winning over the NoTW:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref38" href="#footnote38">38</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Is it your evidence that his News International background was irrelevant to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decision, in other words it was a factor.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. No, it wasn&#8217;t irrelevant, clearly. As I said, his contacts, his knowledge, his work</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at a newspaper, all of that mattered. But if what lies behind the question [is] were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you after a News International executive because this was going to make it easier</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to win over the News of the World or whatever, no, that wasn&#8217;t the calculation. The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">calculation was: who is going to be good enough, tough enough, to deal with what is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a very difficult job?&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Osborne took forward his suggestion by arranging to meet Mr Coulson for a drink</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at a central London bar, on 15 March 2007, two months after he had resigned from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW. Mr Coulson recalled discussing what the Conservative Party should do to organise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its communications in readiness for a general election. He expressed views which are very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">similar to those held by Mr Cameron, placing an emphasis on television and the need to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">promote good relations over the whole spectrum of the media:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I told him that my view of communications was that it needed to be first and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">foremost professional, that we needed to have good relationships with as many</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">media representatives as possible right across the spectrum, and I also told him in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that conversation and again later in a conversation with Mr Cameron that my firm</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">belief was that television would play a crucial part in any General Election campaign.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">My view was more so than it had done previously.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-2-24"><a href="#para2-24" name="para2-24">2.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coulson felt that it was:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;...clear</span><span style="font-style:italic"> from</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> off</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> they</span><span style="font-style:italic"> were</span><span style="font-style:italic"> interested</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hiring</span><span style="font-style:italic"> me&#8221;</span> and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not feel as if he was being interviewed at all.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup> He confided in Rebekah Brooks about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Conservative Party&#8217;s approach.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-25"><a href="#para2-25" name="para2-25">2.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Osborne recalled asking Mr Coulson at the meeting whether he would be interested in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being considered for the post of the Conservative Party&#8217;s Director of Communications. In his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">witness statement he described Mr Coulson saying that he would think about it and calling,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some days later, to say that he was indeed interested, an answer which Mr Osborne passed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on to Mr Cameron.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup> Mr Coulson&#8217;s recollection was slightly different. He believed that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cameron had called him later the same night:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;...to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> say</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Osborne</span><span style="font-style:italic"> had</span><span style="font-style:italic"> told</span><span style="font-style:italic"> him</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> our</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. And then in paragraph 8.1, after Mr Coulson, a few days later, confirmed that he</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was interested in the job, you had a conversation with Mr Cameron about it; is that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">correct?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes. I think I spoke to him pretty soon, actually, David Cameron. My recollection is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that I probably spoke to him on the way back from the drink I&#8217;d had with Mr Coulson</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the telephone&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whatever the precise mechanics were, the initial meeting was certainly followed up. A</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meeting with Mr Cameron was arranged at his office in the Norman Shaw Building, probably</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">later in March 2007. Mr Cameron described this meeting as having been significant: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> ...</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the key meeting about deciding whether or not to employ him...&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Having</span><span style="font-style:normal"> met</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Coulson</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and discussed his possible appointment with Mr Osborne and Steve Hilton, Mr Cameron</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decided in principle that he wanted to appoint Mr Coulson as the Conservative Party&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Director of Communications and Planning. He asked the Party Chairman, the Rt Hon Francis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Maude MP, and his Chief of Staff, Ed Llewellyn, to meet with Mr Coulson to discuss practical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arrangements.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-28"><a href="#para2-28" name="para2-28">2.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These discussions occurred, and at some stage in the process Mr Coulson also spoke to Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Hilton.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup> Final acceptance of the job appears to have occurred in May 2007 after that year&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">local elections, during the course of a telephone call between Mr Cameron and Mr Coulson.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref49" href="#footnote49">49</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coulson commenced his employment with the Conservative Party on 9 July 2007.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-29"><a href="#para2-29" name="para2-29">2.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An issue on which all the witnesses were agreed is that during the recruitment process Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Coulson was asked about phone hacking. However, recollections differed as to precisely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who asked what and when they did so. Mr Osborne recalled asking at his very first meeting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether there was anything more on phone hacking that he should know about that was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">already public. He stated that he received a reply in the negative.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">51</a></sup> Mr Cameron could not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recall being told about this but had no reason to doubt Mr Osborne.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref52" href="#footnote52">52</a></sup> Mr Cameron&#8217;s own</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recollection was that not only did he personally raise the matter with Mr Coulson but also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it was raised when Mr Coulson met with Mr Maude and Mr Llewellyn:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I believe that three such meetings took place: one with both Francis Maude and Ed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Llewellyn. These were about the terms and conditions of the appointment. In the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">meeting they held together, they also asked him specifically about his involvement in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the well-publicised hacking that had taken place while he was editor of the News of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the World and which had led to the convictions of Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He denied any knowledge of the hacking but said that he took responsibility for what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had happened on his watch and had therefore resigned. This was consistent with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what he had said at the time of his resignation as Editor&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span> .</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">So far as his own investigation of the issue was concerned, in his oral evidence Mr Cameron</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described raising the issue at the face-to-face meeting which he had with Mr Coulson in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">March 2007. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref54" href="#footnote54">54</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;My recollection is that I raised the issue of phone hacking and sought the assurance</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the face to face meeting we had in my office. That&#8217;s my recollection. I vaguely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">remember the further telephone call, but that&#8217;s &#8211; I&#8217;ve obviously racked my brains to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">try and remember exactly the sequencing, but my recollection is that I knew it was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">very important that I needed to ask him that question, and therefore did so, as it says</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">in my evidence&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, in response to the suggestion that the issue was raised only during the May 2007</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conversation, he said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref55" href="#footnote55">55</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;That&#8217;s not my recollection. My recollection is that the assurances I sought were in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the face-to-face meeting, but it may be there was a further specific question I needed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to ask in the phone call, I can&#8217;t remember.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">What I&#8217;m absolutely sure about is I remember the conversation with Ed Llewellyn was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">how important it was to see the assurance, and I remember very clearly seeking that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">assurance and getting the assurance...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-31"><a href="#para2-31" name="para2-31">2.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The suggestion that the issue had been raised only once by Mr Cameron was put to him</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because that was how his witness statement appeared to read. Having dealt with the March</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">face-to-face meeting without mentioning the issue, and the subsequent meetings with Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Maude and Mr Llewellyn to discuss practical arrangements, at which they had asked Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Coulson about phone hacking, the witness statement continued:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref56" href="#footnote56">56</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;[Francis Maude and Ed Llewellyn] reported these assurances orally to me, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">said that since these were serious allegations I should personally satisfy myself as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to these assurances by putting these questions directly to Andy Coulson in my own</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">conversations with him, and before formally offering him the job.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I then had a further conversation with Andy Coulson in which I also asked him</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">specifically about his involvement in the hacking case. He repeated what I understood</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he had said to Francis Maude and Ed Llewellyn, that he had no knowledge of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hacking but said that he took responsibility for what had happened on his watch and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had therefore resigned as Editor. I also recall asking him at the same time whether</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there was anything else which I should be aware of which might embarrass the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Conservative Party. He said he did not believe that there was.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-32"><a href="#para2-32" name="para2-32">2.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coulson recalled being asked by Mr Cameron during the course of the telephone</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">conversation in May 2007: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> He</span><span style="font-style:italic"> also</span><span style="font-style:italic"> asked</span><span style="font-style:italic"> me</span><span style="font-style:italic"> about</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Clive</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Goodman</span><span style="font-style:italic"> case&#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref57" href="#footnote57">57</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The witnesses were trying to recall the precise timing of conversations some five years ago</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">now and it is not surprising that in those circumstances that there were some discrepancies.</span>

<a name="page1173"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">twice, three times, or four times (ie 7 March 2007, at the March 2007 face-to-face meeting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Mr Cameron, at the meeting with Messrs Maude and Llewellyn, and during the May</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">telephone conversation) I am entirely satisfied that it was raised; given the significance of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue, it was most probably raised on each of the four occasions.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-34"><a href="#para2-34" name="para2-34">2.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However many times the hacking issue was raised during the recruitment process, what is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear is that the inquiries did not go beyond asking Mr Coulson about the issue and accepting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his assurances. Mr Osborne described consciously considering whether the circumstances of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coulson&#8217;s departure ruled him but concluding that it did not. In doing so, he fairly pointed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the context at the time which must have been reassuring:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref58" href="#footnote58">58</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I did consider whether the circumstances surrounding Mr Coulson&#8217;s departure from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">theNewsoftheWorldruledhimoutasaDirectorofCommunications.ButImadewhat</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I believed was the reasonable assumption at the time that the police had uncovered</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">all the relevant evidence. Mr Coulson had also confirmed to me that this was the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">case. It is worth noting that I was not the only person who accepted this. Before the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">appointment was confirmed on 31 May 2007, the Press Complaints Commission said:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There is no evidence to challenge Mr Myler&#8217;s assertion that: Goodman had deceived</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">his employer in order to obtain cash to pay Mulcaire; that he had concealed the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">identity of the source of information on royal stories; and that no one else at the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">News of the World knew that Messrs. Goodman and Mulcaire were tapping phone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">messages for stories.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-35"><a href="#para2-35" name="para2-35">2.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron similarly pointed to the fact of the police investigation and the subsequent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecution of Messrs Goodman and Mulcaire. He did not shrink from taking responsibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the decision but he understandably reminded the Inquiry of the indisputable importance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of judging the decision without the benefit of hindsight:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The responsibility for employing him on the basis of the assurances that he gave is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mine. I took the view that because he had given me repeated assurances that he had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">no knowledge of hacking, he deserved a second chance.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">If anyone had given me any evidence that Andy Coulson knew about or was in any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">way involved with phone hacking, I would not have employed him.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">And as I said in my statement in the Commons on 20 July 2011, with 20:20 hindsight</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and all that has followed, I would not have offered him the job, and I expect that he</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would not have taken it. As I said then, you do not make decisions in hindsight; you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">make them in the present&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-36"><a href="#para2-36" name="para2-36">2.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Before Mr Coulson started work at Conservative Party Headquarters not only had the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made a reassuring statement about the extent of hacking at the NoTW, so too had the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chairman of News International. James Murdoch&#8217;s evidence was that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...the company told the Select Committee in March 2007 that it believed that Clive</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Goodman was the only person who knew what was going on, and the Committee</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">noted in its report dated 3 July 2007 &#8220;the assurances of the Chairman of News</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cameron was similarly focused on Mr Coulson&#8217;s skills when appointing him:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref63" href="#footnote63">63</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, obviously his knowledge of the industry, his contacts, his work as an editor</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were all important, but the most important thing was: is this person going to be good</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at doing the job of managing the press and communications for the Conservative</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Party? I wasn&#8217;t just after some &#8211;any old person from News International or from the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Daily Mail or from wherever. I wanted somebody really good who was going to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">able to stand up to the pressure that were under and would face in the run-up to an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">election campaign. That was the absolutely key consideration.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-2-39"><a href="#para2-39" name="para2-39">2.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne recognised that there was a risk in hiring Mr Coulson, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both were content to accept that risk. Mr Osborne put it in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref64" href="#footnote64">64</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Why did you run that risk?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Because I thought in the end, the balance was that it was worth hiring someone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with real talent and ability and weathering the adverse publicity that appointing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">someone who had had to resign from the News of the World would bring...&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-40"><a href="#para2-40" name="para2-40">2.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron identified not only the potential controversy arising from the circumstances of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coulson&#8217;s departure from the NoTW but also the fact that he was a tabloid editor. His</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence was as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref65" href="#footnote65">65</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. When you accepted the assurances, did you assess there to be any risk?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. What I assessed was that this was clearly a controversial appointment for two</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reasons. One was that bad things had happened at the News of the World while he</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was editor and he had resigned. So he had left his last job after resigning because</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of things that had happened. So that was obviously &#8211; as I said in my evidence, I was</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">giving him a second chance.</span>

<a name="page1175"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The second reason it was &#8211; there was controversy [sic] is this was a tabloid editor</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and there are some people who would say, you know, &#8220;Don&#8217;t have a tabloid editor&#8221;,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to which my answer would be: it&#8217;s a very tough job, dealing with the press for a major</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">political party. You need someone who has the skills, who has the knowledge, who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">can really help you through what can be an absolute storm, and so I thought it was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the right thing to do...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-41"><a href="#para2-41" name="para2-41">2.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The confidential nature of the recruitment process prevented the taking up of formal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">references. Both Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne did, however, speak informally to Mrs Brooks</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about Mr Coulson. Mr Osborne recalled a brief conversation which took place in the context</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the recruitment process:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref66" href="#footnote66">66</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, I spoke to her after I&#8217;d seen Mr Coulson and after we&#8217;d been considering it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for a couple of weeks, and I don&#8217;t recollect the precise day or anything like that,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but I remember a conversation where I asked her: &#8220;Tell me about Andy Coulson. Tell</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">me, is he a good person? Is he a good person to work with? What do you think of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">him?&#8221; It was never a question about: &#8220;Is he going to bring his News International</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">connections?&#8221; or: &#8220;Tell me more about the circumstances of Andy&#8217;s resignation.&#8221; I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was just simply asking her opinion of him as professional&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-42"><a href="#para2-42" name="para2-42">2.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron was unsure whether his conversation with Mrs Brooks about Mr Coulson had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken place before or after the decision was made, although there would only really have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been a point to such a conversation before the decision was taken:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref67" href="#footnote67">67</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t seeking a reference. I mean, when you&#8217;re employing someone like this who&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been an editor of a newspaper, you can&#8217;t seek sort of formal references. I&#8217;m sure I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would have asked how effective he would be, but this conversation may well have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">taken place after I had made the decision. I can&#8217;t recall exactly when the conversation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">took place. But in the end it was my decision. I was satisfied this was the right thing,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to have a former tabloid editor to help us with our media and communications, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it was my decision.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-43"><a href="#para2-43" name="para2-43">2.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although Mrs Brooks was aware of the recruitment process at the time, Rupert Murdoch</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">denied any direct or personal involvement. He described himself as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> ...just</span><span style="font-style:italic"> as</span><span style="font-style:italic"> surprised</span><span style="font-style:italic"> as</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">An obvious question was the extent to which the decision of the Conservative Party to hire</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coulson had been influenced by the success in opposition of Alastair Campbell for New</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Labour. Mr Osborne recognised some influence, but both he and Mr Cameron were keen to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stress that Mr Campbell and Mr Coulson were different men. Mr Cameron&#8217;s evidence on this</span>

<a name="page1176"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. To what extent were you looking at the example of Alastair Campbell as being</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">obviously politically in a different place but the sort of man in terms of temperament</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and robustness who would be of assistance to you?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Not necessarily. I don&#8217;t think, you know, Alastair Campbell had &#8211; he was much</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more political than Andy Coulson, and I think in all sorts of ways there were occasions</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">when clearly he&#8217;d overstepped the role of what he should have been doing.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-45"><a href="#para2-45" name="para2-45">2.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Osborne put the matter in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref70" href="#footnote70">70</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Well, is it more that actually he brought skills which you&#8217;d</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">seen evidenced by New Labour in Mr Campbell?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I think it is undoubtedly the case that Tony Blair had seen that hiring someone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from the media would bring an added dimension to the communications effort, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Conservative Party had, in opposition, hired a number of people subsequently</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who had been journalists, indeed one person who had been an editor of the paper.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So that was true, but I don&#8217;t think that Mr Coulson and Mr Campbell are cut from the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">same cloth, I would suggest. Alastair Campbell was a political editor.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I thought Andy Coulson brought a broader experience, as an editor of a paper, so</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">managing a large newsroom, and as I say, I think subsequently the way he did the job</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">shows that he was very well qualified to do that job.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-46"><a href="#para2-46" name="para2-46">2.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having been appointed as Director of Communications and Planning, Mr Coulson&#8217;s role was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to oversee all of the party&#8217;s communications departments including press, broadcast and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">online. He specifically oversaw all of the communications for David Cameron and his Shadow</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cabinet and was included in the small group of people with responsibility for the strategic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">planning and execution of the General Election campaign. He attended Mr Cameron&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">morning and afternoon meetings, along with other key staff, and was a part of the general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">planning team. His job was to make sure policy was properly communicated and to advise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the likely media impact of policies. The remit was wide enough to encompass speeches,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press conferences, interviews, and articles given or written by Mr Cameron. He monitored</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">broadcast coverage and assumed a central role in crisis management, for example responding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the MPs&#8217; expenses scandal.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref71" href="#footnote71">71</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">There has been speculation as to whether Mr Coulson had continued to be paid by News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">International whilst working for the Conservative Party. Disclosure by Mr Coulson of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compromise agreement by which his employment with News Group Newspapers Limited</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was terminated explained what had happened. Mr Coulson did not resign unilaterally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">without regard to his contractual entitlements. His employment was terminated on terms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which he agreed with his employer and which were set out in the compromise agreement.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref72" href="#footnote72">72</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coulson was paid in lieu of his employer&#8217;s contractual notice period and compensated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the termination of his employment. The sums due to him pursuant to the compromise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">agreement were paid in two tranches, the second of which was in November 2007, after Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Coulson had started work for the Conservative Party. He also received a quantity of restricted</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In other words, Mr Coulson did receive both cash and shares from his former employer whilst</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he was working for the Conservative Party, but these were payments made in respect of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the termination of his employment with News International and agreed at the time of his</span>

<h3>Strategy and tactics</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-50"><a href="#para2-50" name="para2-50">2.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron described the approach to planning his media effort in the context of his overall</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strategic planning:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref76" href="#footnote76">76</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, the strategy mapped out at the beginning of the year are the things you want</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to achieve, the policies you want to get across, the ideas that you want to champion,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and then after that, you think: right, how do we do that? What&#8217;s the mixture of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapers and television and direct campaigns and the rest we want to do? Then</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">following that, you&#8217;re looking at: where are we going to have impact?&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-51"><a href="#para2-51" name="para2-51">2.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When it came to assessing the relative importance of newspapers, television and direct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">campaigns, Mr Osborne shared with both Mr Cameron and Mr Coulson the view that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">broadcasting was becoming increasingly important. In particular, Mr Osborne challenged the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view that newspapers set the agenda and broadcasters follow. He explained how broadcasters</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">now quite often set the news agenda themselves and described their power as enormous:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref77" href="#footnote77">77</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Do you feel, as some have said again, that the news agenda tends to be driven</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by the printed media and the BBC and other broadcasters follow suit, or do you feel</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it&#8217;s the other way around or a mixture of the two?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I saw Tony Blair&#8217;s evidence on this, and I think that might have been the case</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">perhaps when he was Prime Minister. Speaking personally as someone active in front</span>

<a name="page1178"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">line politics today, I would say the broadcasters are incredibly important. It is not clear</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that they&#8217;re always following a newspaper judgment. I would say the significance of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a story is massively elevated if it is right at the top of one of the big news shows and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that&#8217;s often the judge of whether something is really going to have an impact in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">political sphere.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Now, quite often they will be picking up indeed stories from newspapers, but quite</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">often they&#8217;ll have their own investigations and quite often those &#8211; you know, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">BBC, for example &#8211; and I&#8217;m a supporter of the BBC, so this is not &#8211; I&#8217;m not seeking to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">criticise the entire institution, but they will run a special report, a Panorama report,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">then put that top of the Today programme and suddenly we&#8217;re all expected to treat</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that as the most important thing happening in Britain that day.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s a straightforward process whereby the newspapers run a story</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the journalists &#8211; the broadcast journalists cover it. I think it&#8217;s more complicated</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">than that, and I think the power of the broadcasters is enormous. It is power exercised</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with responsibility, but nevertheless it&#8217;s significant.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-52"><a href="#para2-52" name="para2-52">2.52</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coulson described how he vigilantly monitored broadcasters&#8217; output, especially the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">BBC&#8217;s, and took issue with it as he thought necessary, whilst keeping open as many lines of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">communication with the organisation as he possibly could:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref78" href="#footnote78">78</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Another aspect of my job was to monitor broadcast coverage, in particular the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">BBC, given its audience dominance. My approach was to keep as many lines of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">communication as possible open with the BBC, and to argue our case. I never took</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the view that ranting at producers and editors was either proper or productive. But</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I would monitor the BBC&#8217;s coverage, including online, and firmly register our view</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">when I thought it was appropriate.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-53"><a href="#para2-53" name="para2-53">2.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As for the newspapers, Mr Osborne described a general strategy with achievable objectives:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref79" href="#footnote79">79</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it was a particular strategy for the Sun newspaper. It was a strategy for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the newspapers. We wanted the full throttled support of Conservative-leaning papers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">like the Telegraph and the Mail. We wanted to win over some of those more neutral</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">broadsheets like the Times and the FT. We didn&#8217;t have much hope of the Mirror and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Guardian, and obviously we wanted to win the support of the Sun. But it was a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">general media strategy and it mainly consisted of setting out our argument about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">why the Labour government had forfeited the right to remain in office and why we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">thought a Conservative government would be better for Britain.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-54"><a href="#para2-54" name="para2-54">2.54</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron, who was essentially agreeing with an observation of Mr Brown&#8217;s, identified a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">problem with what he described as the newspapers&#8217; volume knob. It is a feature of modern</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper coverage of politics with which all current politicians have to deal and which one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">supposes must give them an added incentive to make as much effort as possible to cultivate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">good relationships with the press. Mr Cameron put it this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref80" href="#footnote80">80</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Can I ask you to address Mr Brown&#8217;s point that reporting is hyperbolic, it&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sensationalised. He said the politicians don&#8217;t simply make errors of judgment, their</span>

<a name="page1179"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">motives are always put into question. Do you associate yourself as a matter of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">generality with that point or not?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I think there are occasions when that can happen. As I&#8217;ve said, it links back to this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">thing about newspapers being under pressure to find something special and different</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and go for impact, and sometimes that can mean questioning motives. So you do &#8211; I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">don&#8217;t want to make this sound like sort of politicians complaining about &#8211; of course</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we should have a vigorous press and they should give us a good going over and they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">do and that&#8217;s fine.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Sometimes it is frustrating when you feel your motives are endlessly being questioned,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and &#8211; but, you know, there&#8217;s bound to be a certain amount of that, but I think the way</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I put it is that the volume knob has sometimes just been turned really high in our</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press and I&#8217;m not sure sometimes that does anyone any favours.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-55"><a href="#para2-55" name="para2-55">2.55</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coulson aimed to meet or talk to most editors, political editors and some columnists on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a reasonably regular basis (as he also did with broadcast journalists), considering it to be an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important part of his job. He occasionally met with proprietors or senior executives. These</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meetings were mostly off the record and with an informal agenda. Amongst other things,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coulson sought to use the meetings to clear up inaccuracies or misunderstandings which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been printed or broadcast or simply to promote the Prime Minister&#8217;s message. Together</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Mr Cameron and other senior Conservative politicians he would also occasionally attend</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meals hosted by newspapers, for example at the party conference when the Telegraph, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Daily Mail and The Times all hosted their own dinners. The conference itself was a period of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intense contact with the media. They would also give speeches at events organised by various</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref81" href="#footnote81">81</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-56"><a href="#para2-56" name="para2-56">2.56</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron said that he had sometimes directly asked titles for support:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;&#8230;But</span><span style="font-style:italic"> obviously</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">occasion you&#8217;d say, &#8220;We&#8217;d love a bit more support from your paper&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref82" href="#footnote82">82</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-57"><a href="#para2-57" name="para2-57">2.57</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although Mr Cameron was in any event spending a great deal of time cultivating good</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relations with the media and seeking to spread his message through them, it is clear that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Coulson brought a renewed vigour to this activity with a particular emphasis on ensuring not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">just formal but also informal face-to-face contact with journalists:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref83" href="#footnote83">83</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I attended coffee meetings between David Cameron and other journalists, at various</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">times. In opposition, David and Samantha Cameron would also host occasional</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">dinners at his home for media. These included newspaper and broadcast journalists.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I would usually, although not always, attend. I played a central role in organising this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">diary of activity but David Cameron was not always an entirely willing participant.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Given the choice, I think he would have preferred to be doing other work or enjoying</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a night home with his family. However, he understood, and reluctantly agreed, that it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was important to meet with journalists, formally and informally.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">too close:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref84" href="#footnote84">84</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. The Prime Minister said in July 2011 words to the effect that &#8220;We all got too close</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to News International&#8221;. You probably recall that, Mr Coulson, don&#8217;t you?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A. Yes.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Is that a view he expressed to you before July 2011, in particular before you left,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which I think was in January 2011?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. No, I don&#8217;t remember him doing so.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-59"><a href="#para2-59" name="para2-59">2.59</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nor did he express that view to Mrs Brooks:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref85" href="#footnote85">85</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Mr Cameron also said publicly:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We all got too close to News International.&#8221; Or words to that effect. Was that a view</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he ever communicated to you personally?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">&#8220;A. No.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-60"><a href="#para2-60" name="para2-60">2.60</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coulson advanced three reasons to explain why he felt that contact of the nature and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extent which he was orchestrating had become essential:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref86" href="#footnote86">86</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It was important for three reasons. Firstly, you stood a better chance of getting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">your message across and of stopping misunderstandings quickly if you had good</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relationships. In a perfect world as Prime Minister you would issue a statement, give</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an interview, or stage a press conference and your message would be communicated</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the public in fair, even-handed reports. Modern politics doesn&#8217;t work that way.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">What we did and said required explanation and at times I needed to fight our corner</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for fair coverage.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Secondly, I took the view that it was important that journalists saw David Cameron</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in a relaxed and informal mode, as well as at work. Again, modern politics demands</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this. I felt it was important to show his authentic life away from work, not least as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Labour Party was working hard to convince the public that he spent his private</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">moments lounging around a mansion, in top hat and tails, sipping champagne and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nibbling on caviar. This was an important myth to dispel.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Thirdly, journalists want to meet politicians. There is no substitute in journalism for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">face to face contact. It was also important for David Cameron to hear what some of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the journalists had to say on behalf of their readers and viewers. I believe I was even-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">handed in who had access to him&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-61"><a href="#para2-61" name="para2-61">2.61</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These are revealing insights into what motivated Mr Cameron&#8217;s Director of Communications</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to seek even closer proximity to the media for a principal who was already highly active</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and experienced in his dealing with the media. Mr Coulson clearly felt that this extra effort</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was required to achieve the legitimate media goals which are incorporated into the reasons</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">quoted above: fair and even handed reporting, the rapid resolution of misunderstandings,</span>

<p id="para-id-2-62"><a href="#para2-62" name="para2-62">2.62</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is self evident that any solution to a problem of over proximity between the press and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">senior politicians must involve a proper distance or, at least, transparency. But if that is to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">achievable in practice, the politician&#8217;s legitimate media objectives, such as those identified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">above, must be attainable from that proper distance and with appropriate transparency.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Otherwise, the temptation to get too close will be irresistible. I shall return to this issue when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concluding this Part of the Report and making recommendations.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-63"><a href="#para2-63" name="para2-63">2.63</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coulson drew on his experience in the media to advise about the Conservative Party&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">communications effort, including matters such as how best to talk to proprietors and editors,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as Mr Osborne explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref87" href="#footnote87">87</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. But was Mr Coulson able to give advice as to how best to obtain the Sun&#8217;s support,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">even if, as you say, it was far less important than many commentators have claimed?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Well, I think his advice was how to handle our communications effort. Yes, how to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">talk to proprietors and editors and so on ...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-64"><a href="#para2-64" name="para2-64">2.64</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron&#8217;s strategy of maintaining a very wide range of media contacts met with Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Coulson&#8217;s entire approval. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref88" href="#footnote88">88</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;... I think the party had very good relationships with the Guardian. I think I probably</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wouldn&#8217;t include the Daily Mirror, in truth, or the Sunday Mirror. I didn&#8217;t put an awful</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">lot of effort into either of those papers, although we met and we talked, actually.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">But yes, I &#8211; and more importantly David Cameron &#8211; took the view that we had to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">talk to as many people as possible. The Tories had a &#8211; the party had an electoral</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mountain to climb, it was of historic proportions. So we wanted to touch as many</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">readerships as we possibly could and get our message across as far and wide as we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">could.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-2-65"><a href="#para2-65" name="para2-65">2.65</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When considering individual titles the Conservative strategy was not limited to those at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the top of the organisation but extended to developing contacts and promoting contacts in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">depth. Mr Coulson explained that the rationale for doing so was to maximise the chance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">favourable coverage:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref89" href="#footnote89">89</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;... I was keen actually that we had good relationships throughout &#8211; as much as we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could throughout the paper. Same goes for &#8211; if I can keep adding this &#8211; for other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapers. It is not &#8211; newspapers don&#8217;t work that way. You know, you can&#8217;t rely</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on a call to an editor to guarantee anything, and nor should you. What you were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">attempting to do was build a series of relationships where when you had something</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">positive to say you would give yourself the best possible chance of getting the best</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">possible coverage, and so it was actually a range of relationships throughout all the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">newspapers.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Returning to one of the concerns which he expressed when explaining why informal face-to-</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron met Aidan Barclay, Chairman of TMG, numerous times whilst in Opposition,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sometimes in formal surroundings and sometimes informally. Two of the meetings occurred</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">during the contest for the leadership of the Conservative Party, in the form of a meeting at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Barclay&#8217;s office and then a short while later, breakfast at the Ritz (which is owned by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Barclay family). There were two more meetings, on 27 April 2006 and 12 June 2007, in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">period between the leadership election and Mr Coulson&#8217;s appointment; both were meals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the Ritz. Thereafter, there was a dinner on 25 February 2008, a meeting at Mr Barclay&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">office on 3 November 2009, before Mr Cameron invited Mr Barclay to his home for dinner on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">25 November 2009. The final meeting in opposition was a breakfast at the Ritz on 22 March</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010, a few weeks before the general election.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref91" href="#footnote91">91</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-68"><a href="#para2-68" name="para2-68">2.68</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A text message the day after the pre election meeting evidences the fact that the election</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">campaign had been discussed and plans laid for there to be a daily call between the Telegraph</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the Conservatives during the campaign:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref92" href="#footnote92">92</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;David good to see you congratulations to you both on the prospect of an addition to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the family spoken to tony G and repeated our conversation asked him to be in touch</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to arrange daily call during campaign as discussed. Regards Aidan&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-69"><a href="#para2-69" name="para2-69">2.69</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his evidence, Mr Barclay explained the background to the text and, in particular that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had suggested that there be a daily call between Mr Cameron and the editor of the Telegraph</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in order most easily to enable Mr Cameron to get his message across:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref93" href="#footnote93">93</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. Well, as you probably realise, in any large organisation sometimes you have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">difficulty communicating a message across to the right person, particularly if it gets</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">passed down the line, and so I suggested to the Prime Minister that if he wanted to get</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the attention of the editor and wanted to get his message across in the most efficient</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">manner, he should make a habit of phoning him on a daily basis and I recommended</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that&#8217;s what they should do.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Sorry, is it the Prime Minister calling &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. It&#8217;s whichever way around it was, but there should be a daily call &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Between the editor and the Prime Minister?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">A. Yes&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span> .</span>

<p id="para-id-2-70"><a href="#para2-70" name="para2-70">2.70</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron did not think that a daily personal call between him and Mr Gallagher had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discussed but he agreed that a call between the Conservative Party and Mr Gallagher had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been agreed and that its purpose was to facilitate putting across the Conservative message:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref94" href="#footnote94">94</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Tony Gallagher. I don&#8217;t know whether it was necessarily going to be me, but I think</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this was me wanting to make sure that the Telegraph knew our policies and our plans</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and all the rest of it. I think that&#8217;s what it was about.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-71"><a href="#para2-71" name="para2-71">2.71</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The advantages for both Mr Cameron and the Telegraph arising from this example of informal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contact with the proprietor of a friendly title are plain to see. By this time Mr Cameron had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">already secured the clear support of the Telegraph and the discussions on 22 March 2010</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerned only the mechanics of best communicating Mr Cameron&#8217;s message. That the &#8216;full</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">throttled&#8217; support of the Telegraph (as Mr Osborne described the Conservative Party&#8217;s goal)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been won was made unequivocally clear both during and after Mr Cameron and Murdoch</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MacLennan, the Chief Executive of TMG, had dinner together in February 2010. In his follow</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">up letter dated 9 February 2010, Mr MacLennan wrote:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref95" href="#footnote95">95</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Mr MacLennan. The Telegraph&#8217;s support of the Conservative Party was predictable and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there had been numerous meetings between senior Conservatives and editors and senior</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">executives from TMG over the years. But they vividly illustrate the power of face to face</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meetings to maximise both the personal support of a sympathetic title for an individual</span>

<p id="para-id-2-73"><a href="#para2-73" name="para2-73">2.73</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron was understandably keen to win back the support of News International&#8217;s titles</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from New Labour. As he put it:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;No politician who wishes to get his message across to the public could afford not to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">take into account the scope of News International&#8217;s coverage when deciding which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people to meet&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref96" href="#footnote96">96</a></sup> When he assumed the leadership of the Conservative Party he</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hoped that: &#8220;...in time, we would have the support of News International&#8217;s papers.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">After all, these papers fundamentally share the same views on society and the free</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">contact of a strictly business nature was when the two men met at The Sun&#8217;s offices in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Wapping in October 2005 before the leadership election.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref101" href="#footnote101">101</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-75"><a href="#para2-75" name="para2-75">2.75</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thereafter they met face to face, or were at the same events, on at least ten occasions whilst</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron served as Leader of the Opposition.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref102" href="#footnote102">102</a></sup> There was some discrepancy between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the schedules of contact provided by the witnesses.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref103" href="#footnote103">103</a></sup> There were many potential reasons for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the discrepancies and no indication that those who had compiled the schedules on behalf of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their principals had done anything other than their best from old records, diaries etc, which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were never intended to record precisely what contact had actually occurred.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref104" href="#footnote104">104</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-76"><a href="#para2-76" name="para2-76">2.76</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The contact usually took place at meetings over a meal, or at News Corporation functions but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was also some social contact. Both men were present, as were Mr Blair and Mr Brown,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the wedding of Rebekah Wade to Charlie Brooks on 13 June 2009. Six months later, on 19</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">December 2009, Mrs Brooks arranged a dinner attended by the Camerons, the Osbornes, Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Brooks, Rupert, James and Kathryn Murdoch. This event took place not long after The Sun</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had, in September 2009, switched its support from Mr Brown to Mr Cameron, and it is easy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to envisage it cementing the newly warmed relationship between News International and Mr</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;I mean, in most of my lunches or breakfasts with Rupert Murdoch, the conversation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">has always been predominantly about economic issues, security geopolitical issues,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he was very interested in what was happening in Afghanistan, very interested in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">global markets.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think it&#8217;s &#8211; of course all businesses have their interests and the rest of it, but in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my dealings with Rupert Murdoch, most of the conversation has been about big</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">international political issues.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-78"><a href="#para2-78" name="para2-78">2.78</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Murdoch did not recall the detail of the conversations but his recollection generally of his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conversations with Prime Ministers certainly bore out that these were topics which he spoke</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to senior politicians about and was interested in. His keen interest in geopolitics was very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">probably raised and, in particular, the conduct of the war in Afghanistan and perception of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public opinion on the circumstances in which British troops were fighting was to play a role in</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">on this issue was well illustrated by the following evidence which he gave about his views on</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think, beyond us going in there. I felt very strongly, particularly when I came here and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">saw the photographs of the great young British soldiers who&#8217;d either been wounded</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or killed there, I felt very strongly when the charge was made that they weren&#8217;t being</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">properly protected, and I was dissatisfied with Mr Cameron&#8217;s [sic] answer that they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were better protected than any other Europeans. Our argument was that they should</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be as well protected as the Americans.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">And although we kept the relationship always with Mr Cameron &#8211; I&#8217;m sorry, Mr Brown,</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: &#8211; I&#8217;d like to ask you to separate out in your mind the question</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whether you might be discussing some topic or issue for commercial advantage &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you&#8217;ve told Mr Jay that you never did &#8211; from the separate question: whether in fact</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">these were topics that were worthy of discussion and on which you had a view. So,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for example, you&#8217;ve mentioned that you talked about Afghanistan, and it would be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">perfectly reasonable for you to have a view on that. Lots of people will. And your</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">view may be informed by your worldwide contacts through the businesses that you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">operate. That&#8217;s merely your view. But, therefore, your view on, for example, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regulation of television would itself be of value and may be of interest to those who</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are formulating policy, not because it necessarily would affect News Corp, but because</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this is a business to which you have devoted your life, therefore it&#8217;s not surprising you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">will have strong views and I&#8217;m just slightly surprised &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I understand.</span>

<a name="page1186"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: &#8211; if nobody did ask your view.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I understand, sir. I just wish to say that I&#8217;d long since become disillusioned and it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was a waste of time to talk to politicians about the BBC, and that was about all there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was to it. And Ofcom, no, I did not speak to him about that. It would have been asking</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for something, probably, and I didn&#8217;t do that.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-82"><a href="#para2-82" name="para2-82">2.82</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Murdoch was at pains to point out that if his priority had been to secure the most benign</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory environment for his business interests then he would always have supported the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Conservative Party which, of course, has not always happened. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref111" href="#footnote111">111</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;No, Mr Jay, you keep inferring that endorsements were motivated by business</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">motives, and if that had been the case, we would have endorsed the Tory Party in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">every election. It was always more pro business. I could have been like the Telegraph.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I could even have texted him every day. But I didn&#8217;t. I was interested in issues.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(emphasis added)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">And later:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref112" href="#footnote112">112</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;If I&#8217;d been interested in commercial interests, I would have supported the Tory Party</span>

<p id="para-id-2-83"><a href="#para2-83" name="para2-83">2.83</a></p>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">For his part, Mr Cameron was emphatic that there had been no &#8216;deals&#8217; between the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Conservative Party and News International. He rejected the suggestion that there had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">either express or implied deals with the media with this answer:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref114" href="#footnote114">114</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. I don&#8217;t accept that. First of all, on this idea of overt deals, this idea that somehow</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Conservative Party and News International got together and said, &#8220;You give us</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">your support and we&#8217;ll wave through this merger&#8221;, that by the way we didn&#8217;t even</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know about at that stage, I think the idea of overt deals is nonsense, and you&#8217;ve heard</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that from lots of people in front of this Inquiry. I also don&#8217;t believe in this theory that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there was a nod and a wink and some sort of covert agreement. Of course, I wanted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to win over newspapers and other journalists, editors, proprietors, broadcasters.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I worked very hard at that because I wanted to communicate what the Conservative</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Party and my leadership could bring to the country. I made those arguments. But I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">didn&#8217;t do it on the basis of saying, either overtly or covertly, &#8220;Your support will mean I&#8217;ll</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">give you a better time on this policy or that policy&#8221;, and there are plenty of examples</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of policies that I believe in that the people who were backing me didn&#8217;t believe in.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">yacht before meeting Rupert Murdoch. After that we returned on the jet to Dalaman</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for a family holiday. My family and I did not fly back to London on the jet and I paid</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for my air fare as well as that of my family.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-86"><a href="#para2-86" name="para2-86">2.86</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The excursion to Santorini was proposed to Mr Cameron by Mr Freud. For Mr Cameron it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an opportunity to try and win support from Mr Murdoch, by engaging directly at a personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">level:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref118" href="#footnote118">118</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, from my point of view, it was just a better opportunity to try to get to know</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Rupert Murdoch better. Obviously I was trying to win over his newspapers and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">put across my opinions, so for me it was just an opportunity to try and build that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">relationship.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It was quite a long way to go and all of that, but it seemed a good opportunity&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-87"><a href="#para2-87" name="para2-87">2.87</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For Mr Murdoch, the meeting was less memorable. He did not recall it and had had to check</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with his wife and daughter to remind himself.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref119" href="#footnote119">119</a></sup> He regarded the lengths to which Mr Cameron</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had gone to meet him as not unusual and one got the feeling that Mr Murdoch was well used</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to political leaders seeking him out: a telling indicator of the power and importance of one of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the biggest media proprietors:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref120" href="#footnote120">120</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. Well, I think I&#8217;ve explained that politicians go out of their way to impress people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the press, and I don&#8217;t remember discussing any heavy political things with him at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">all. There may have been some issues discussed passingly. It was not a long meeting.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">As I say, I don&#8217;t really remember the meeting. I think that&#8217;s part of the democratic</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">process. They &#8211; all politicians of all sides like to have their views known by the editors</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of newspapers or publishers, hoping that they will be put across, hoping that they will</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be &#8211; that they will succeed in impressing people. That&#8217;s the game.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, it seemed to &#8211; it was a very cordial meeting and it went well. Like I say, it lasted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for either an afternoon or an evening, so it wasn&#8217;t particularly long&#8221;.</span>
<h4>James Murdoch</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-89"><a href="#para2-89" name="para2-89">2.89</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron saw more of James Murdoch than Rupert Murdoch whilst in Opposition. There</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were at least 15 meetings during this period.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref124" href="#footnote124">124</a></sup> The type of contact was similar, typically taking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">place over meals or at events.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref125" href="#footnote125">125</a></sup> Mr Cameron&#8217;s purpose in meeting James Murdoch was to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">get across his political message in the hope of winning the support of News International:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref126" href="#footnote126">126</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; most of these meetings were really about me trying to promote Conservative</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">policy, the Conservative approach and the rest of it, but sometimes, because I&#8217;m</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interested in media issues and have longstanding views on them, sometimes I&#8217;m sure</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we would have discussed them.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-90"><a href="#para2-90" name="para2-90">2.90</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There were wide ranging discussions including defence and economy.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref127" href="#footnote127">127</a></sup> As James Murdoch</span>

<p id="para-id-2-91"><a href="#para2-91" name="para2-91">2.91</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of particular interest to the Inquiry, they also discussed both the role of Ofcom and the BBC,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subjects on which each held different views. Speaking about the BBC and Ofcom, Mr Cameron</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">put it this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref129" href="#footnote129">129</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; I&#8217;m sure that over the years I&#8217;ve discussed some of those issues with James</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Murdoch. He has very strong views on them, I have very strong views, they&#8217;re not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">really the same views, and I&#8217;m sure we would have had discussions about it. Perhaps</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">particularly &#8211; well, I think probably on both. I don&#8217;t recall the specifics, but I&#8217;m sure</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we must have discussed our views.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-92"><a href="#para2-92" name="para2-92">2.92</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These differences of view did not prevent News International ultimately coming to the view</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Influential,andsupremelyconnected,RebekahBrooks(n&#233;eWade)waseditorofTheSunwhen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron became Leader of the Opposition. She remained in that role until September</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2009 when she was promoted to become Chief Executive of News International.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref131" href="#footnote131">131</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-94"><a href="#para2-94" name="para2-94">2.94</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry took evidence from both Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks about their contacts. Both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provided lists of their contacts, Mr Cameron a list of meetings with media figures as Leader</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Opposition and Mrs Brooks a list of meetings with leaders of political parties.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref132" href="#footnote132">132</a></sup> As has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">already been adverted to above, there were many straightforward reasons why Mr Cameron&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">list could not be 100% accurate or comprehensive.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref133" href="#footnote133">133</a></sup> Similar considerations applied to Mrs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Brooks&#8217; list and she accepted that hers was not comprehensive.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref134" href="#footnote134">134</a></sup> It is plain enough that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">neither list is comprehensive insofar as it relates to contact between the two because each</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contains a number of entries relating to such contact not found in the other. Nevertheless,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they were useful starting points for piecing together enough of their contact to form a reliable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impression of what had passed between them in this period. Supplemented by the oral and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">documentary evidence, the Inquiry was able to build a picture, amply sufficient for its high</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">level Terms of Reference. The account which follows is drawn from the totality of the evidence.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-95"><a href="#para2-95" name="para2-95">2.95</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">After the leadership contest, contact started on 18 January 2006, when Ms Wade (as she</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then was) was one of a party of senior News International figures who accompanied Rupert</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch when he lunched with Mr Cameron.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref135" href="#footnote135">135</a></sup> During the leadership race itself, Mrs Brooks</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not recall supporting any particular candidate. She said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref136" href="#footnote136">136</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Mrs Brooks, we&#8217;re onto Mr Cameron now, According to his biography, in 2005,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you actually supported Mr Liam Fox for the Conservative leadership. Is that correct</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">or not?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I don&#8217;t think that is correct. I can&#8217;t &#8211; I don&#8217;t think the Sun came out for a particular</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">candidate in the leadership. We probably didn&#8217;t support Ken Clarke because of Europe,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but I don&#8217;t remember actually having a particular line in the paper for the leadership&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Wade next dined with Mr Cameron, in the company of Trevor Kavanagh on 28 March</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2006. Further dinners followed on 30 September and 1 October 2006, both in the company</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">leader of the opposition. My sense was I was in contact a lot less than he was. But I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">can&#8217;t put numbers on it.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">But certainly, you know, in 2006, 2007, not necessarily every week, I don&#8217;t think&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In 2008, Mr Cameron and Ms Wade lunched on 23 April 2008. They were both at a social</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">event on 5 July 2008 and an event on 10 July 2008. On 16 August 2008 they were both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at a dinner with Matthew Freud and Elisabeth Murdoch (this being the occasion on which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron flew to Santorini and also met Rupert Murdoch). Relations between Mr Cameron</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Ms Wade were already warm by this stage. She accepted that by then she was &#8220;quite</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">friendly&#8221; with Mr Cameron.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref141" href="#footnote141">141</a></sup> Ms Wade and colleagues from The Sun dined with Mr Cameron</span>

<p id="para-id-2-100"><a href="#para2-100" name="para2-100">2.100</a></p>
 The Rt Hon Dominic Grieve MP was the Shadow Home Secretary between June 2008 and
<span style="font-size: 15px;">January 2009.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref142" href="#footnote142">142</a></sup> There was animated discussion about the Human Rights Act at a dinner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at which Ms Wade, Mr Grieve and other shadow cabinet members, but not Mr Cameron,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were present. The discussion turned upon the Conservative Party&#8217;s interest in the possibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of repealing the Human Rights Act and replacing it with a British Bill of Rights. According</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Mrs Brooks, Mr Grieve was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;just</span><span style="font-style:italic"> making</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> legal</span><span style="font-style:italic"> point</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> difficult</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> do&#8221;</span> .</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mrs Brooks denied rumours that she later sought to persuade Mr Cameron to remove</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Grieve from his portfolio as Shadow Home Secretary, asserting that it was his colleagues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who were in disagreement with him at the time:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref143" href="#footnote143">143</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;No, I did not tell Mr Cameron to move him. What &#8211; the conversation &#8211; as I say, it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was a very heated conversation, borne out by &#8211; his colleagues were trying to almost</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">silence him at the table because he was, in effect, saying one of the promises the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Conservatives had made to the electorate was they were going to repeal &#8211; and it was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">almost the opposite way around, that they were concerned that his view was not to</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be taken seriously, and as it turned out, he was entirely correct&#8221;.</span>

 Mrs Brooks&#8217; list of meetings with the leaders of political parties refers toa breakfast meeting
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Mr Cameron at the start of the year, on 22 January 2008 and to a New Year&#8217;s Eve Party</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on 31 December 2008. Neither of these entries is in Mr Cameron&#8217;s list. The New Year&#8217;s Eve</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Party was held at the Brooks&#8217; farm and was in fact hosted by Mr Brooks&#8217; sister. By 2008, Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cameron counted Ms Wade as a good friend, notwithstanding her paper&#8217;s support, and her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal support, for Mr Brown.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref145" href="#footnote145">145</a></sup> The growing friendship had been helped along by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fact that Mr Cameron had known Charlie Brooks, whom Mrs Brooks was to marry in 2009,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for over 30 years.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref146" href="#footnote146">146</a></sup> It did not prevent her newspaper giving its continued support to Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Brown&#8217;s Government and remaining critical of the Conservatives. For example, on 14 October</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2008, The Sun criticised Conservative opposition to extending the detention time for terrorist</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suspects to 42 days.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref147" href="#footnote147">147</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-103"><a href="#para2-103" name="para2-103">2.103</a></p>
 There wasa dinner on 29</span> January<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009 at whicha number of newspaper editors and Robert
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Peston were present. Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks were both at Mr Brooks&#8217; book launch on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1 April 2009. Mr Cameron was then one of a number of high profile politicians who attended</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the wedding of Ms Wade to Mr Brooks on 13 June 2009. As has been explained he was a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">friend of both the bride and groom. The wedding further cemented Mr Cameron&#8217;s friendship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Mrs Brooks. In his words: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8230;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> our</span><span style="font-style:italic"> relationship</span><span style="font-style:italic"> got</span><span style="font-style:italic"> stronger</span><span style="font-style:italic"> when</span><span style="font-style:italic"> she</span><span style="font-style:italic"> married</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Charlie</span></span>

<p id="para-id-2-104"><a href="#para2-104" name="para2-104">2.104</a></p>
 It was during this month that Mrs Brooks recalled initial internal discussions with Rupert
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and James Murdoch about transferring The Sun&#8217;s political support.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref149" href="#footnote149">149</a></sup> Although it was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mrs Brooks who informed Mr Cameron of The Sun&#8217;s decision to abandon its support for Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Brown, Mr Cameron had felt that she was onside months rather than weeks before it actually</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">took place.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref150" href="#footnote150">150</a></sup> On 21 September 2009, a few days before The Sun announced its change of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allegiance, James Murdoch, Mrs Brooks and Mr Cameron had dinner together. The three also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">shared breakfast on 2 November 2009 and on 19 December 2009 Mr Cameron dined with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mrs Brooks and Rupert Murdoch at the Brooks&#8217;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Camerons&#8217; home on 24 October 2009. None of these meetings appeared in Mr Cameron&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">record. As best she could recall, Mrs Brooks thought that the European constitution debate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Afghanistan were discussed on 3 May 2009.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref151" href="#footnote151">151</a></sup></span>

 The increasing social contact that Mr Cameron was having with Mrs Brooks brought abouta
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commensurate increase in telephone contact. When asked about such contact in the years</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2008 and 2009, Mr Cameron put it this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref152" href="#footnote152">152</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think as we got closer to the election and the decision of the Sun and also the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wedding and she&#8217;s moved in to Charlie Brooks&#8217; house, which is very near where I live</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in &#8211; where we live in the constituency, then the level of contact went up, and we saw</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">each other socially more.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">And then:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref153" href="#footnote153">153</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It&#8217;s very difficult because I don&#8217;t have a record and I don&#8217;t want to give you an answer</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that isn&#8217;t right, so, you know, sometimes I expect we would have been talking to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">each other quite a bit, particularly around the time perhaps of the wedding or when</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we were both in Oxfordshire, we would have had more frequent contact&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">added)<span style="font-style:italic"> .</span></span>

<p id="para-id-2-107"><a href="#para2-107" name="para2-107">2.107</a></p>
A check by Mr Cameron with Mrs Samantha Cameron&#8217;s</span> diary was able to provide more<span style="font-weight:normal;"> detail,
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enabling Mr Cameron subsequently to add: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8230;[Mrs</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Cameron]</span><span style="font-style:italic"> points</span><span style="font-style:italic"> out</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> were</span><span style="font-style:italic"> only</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the constituency 23 weekends in 2008, 23 weekends in 2009 and I think 15 in 2010. And she</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reckons we probably didn&#8217;t see them more than on average once every six weeks, so that is a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">better answer than what I was able to give you earlier.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref154" href="#footnote154">154</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-108"><a href="#para2-108" name="para2-108">2.108</a></p>
 Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks also used SMS text messages to keep in touch. Mrs Brooks
<span style="font-size: 15px;">estimated that she exchanged texts on average once per week with Mr Cameron, more during</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the subsequent general election campaign:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref155" href="#footnote155">155</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Probably more &#8211; between January 2010, maybe &#8211; during the election campaign,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">maybe slightly more, but on average, once a week&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-109"><a href="#para2-109" name="para2-109">2.109</a></p>
 TextcontactbetweenMrCameronandMrsBrooksreflectedthecloseandfriendlyrelationship
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which both explained had developed. This was not in issue because Mr Cameron agreed in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">general with the gist of her evidence about the quantity and tone of text messages.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref156" href="#footnote156">156</a></sup> If</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">illustration is needed, when asked how the messages were signed off, Mrs Brooks said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref157" href="#footnote157">157</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A, &#8230; He would sign them off &#8220;DC&#8221; in the main&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Anything else?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Occasionally he would sign them off &#8220;LOL&#8221;, &#8220;Lots of love&#8221;, actually until I told him it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">meant &#8220;laugh out loud&#8221;, then he didn&#8217;t sign them like that any more. But in the main,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">DC, I would have thought.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">are entitled to be friendly with whomsoever they wish and there must remain some space for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a private life in even the most public of figures. For the purposes of the Inquiry, concerned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the relationship between politicians and the press, what matters is the extent to which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the influence of the press can be manifest not only in public, through the megaphone of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers, or formally through transparent access, but also informally in ways which might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cause a perception of undue influence. It is unnecessary, intrusive and unhelpful to descend</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into too much detail of personal contact; only its extent needs to be clear: this also I shall</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">return to in the context of conclusions and recommendations.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-111"><a href="#para2-111" name="para2-111">2.111</a></p>
 That point naturally leads to the quantity of text messages passing between Mr Cameron and
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mrs Brooks which were disclosed by News International and thus identifies the approach of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry to them. Mr Jay explained why only one of these was put into evidence:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref158" href="#footnote158">158</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I should make it clear before I read it out that News International have recently</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">disclosed a number of other text messages between Mrs Brooks and Mr Cameron,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pursuant to a Section 21 request. A section 21 request is in fact an order under statute</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">requiring people to disclose material. Those relate to the period October 2009, May</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2011 and June 2011. In the Inquiry&#8217;s judgment, all the other text messages I have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">referred to are irrelevant to its terms of reference. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re only going to look</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at one. And News International through their solicitors Linklaters have also explained</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">why text messages in other monthly periods are not available, and their letter will be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">put on our website.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So the one we&#8217;re looking at is 7 October 2009, which I think is during the party</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">conference.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-112"><a href="#para2-112" name="para2-112">2.112</a></p>
 The text in question (which</span> has been the subject of considerable media<span style="font-weight:normal;"> attention) was sent
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by Mrs Brooks to Mr Cameron on 7 October 2009 at 16:45hrs, just days after The Sun had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">abandoned support for Mr Brown. After the first line which was redacted on grounds of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevance, the text read:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref159" href="#footnote159">159</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;But seriously [which suggests that the first line contains or might contain something</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of a jocular nature] I do understand the issue with the Times. Let&#8217;s discuss over</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">country supper soon. On the party it was because I had asked a number of NI [that&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">obviously News International] people to Manchester post endorsement and they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were disappointed not to see you. But as always Sam was wonderful &#8211; (and I thought</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it was OE&#8217;s that were charm personified!) I am so rooting for you tomorrow not just</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as a proud friend but because professionally we&#8217;re definitely in this together! Speech</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of your life? Yes he Cam!&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

 The reference in the message to &#8220;tomorrow&#8221;</span> was to Mr<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Cameron&#8217;s speech to the Conservative
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Party Conference. The background to the message was that Mr Cameron had apologised for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not attending the Times&#8217; party at the conference.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref160" href="#footnote160">160</a></sup> The striking phrase &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> we&#8217;re</span><span style="font-style:italic"> definitely</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it</span></span>

 Mr Cameron confirmed thata country supper was the sort of interaction he often had with
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mrs Brooks and demonstrates how the discussion of professional matters in a very informal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">social environment was occurring.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref162" href="#footnote162">162</a></sup></span>

 The only pre-election</span> meeting in<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2010 between Mrs Brooks and Mr Cameron recorded in
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron&#8217;s schedule of contact with the media in opposition was on 29 January 2010, at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an event also attended by the editors of the Times and the Sunday Times.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref163" href="#footnote163">163</a></sup> This appears to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">correspond with Mrs Brooks&#8217; record which refers to a single meeting at News Corporation&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Davos conference in that month.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref164" href="#footnote164">164</a></sup> More meetings in fact took place. Mrs Brooks recalled</span>

 During the general election campaign of 2010</span> Mrs Brooks put the frequency at twicea<span style="font-weight:normal;"> week.
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As to their content, she said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref166" href="#footnote166">166</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Some, if not the majority, were to do with organisation, so meeting up or arranging</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to speak. Some were about a social occasion, and occasionally some would be my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">own personal comment on perhaps the TV debates, something like that&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-117"><a href="#para2-117" name="para2-117">2.117</a></p>
 Mrs Brooks did not text either Mr Brown or Mr Clegg during the campaign.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref167" href="#footnote167">167</a></sup>

<p id="para-id-2-118"><a href="#para2-118" name="para2-118">2.118</a></p>
 Tracing the development of the communications between Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks during
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opposition reveals clear trends. The volume of contact increased over time, particularly as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">result of the increasing social contact. The nature of the contact changed. At the start it can</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only really have involved Mr Cameron trying to get his political message across to the editor of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a newspaper then supporting the opposition. By the end, it was less a matter of Mr Cameron</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gettinghismessage overtotheneweditorofTheSunandmoreaquestionofNewsInternational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> together</span> &#8221; with Mr Cameron, and seeking to get his message across for him.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-119"><a href="#para2-119" name="para2-119">2.119</a></p>
 It was not only Mrs Brooks who playeda part in the developing contact between Mr Cameron
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and News International. Matthew and Elisabeth Freud (n&#233;e Murdoch) also moved in similar</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circles. As has been described, Mr Freud provided his private jet to enable Mr Cameron to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meet Rupert Murdoch in Santorini.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref168" href="#footnote168">168</a></sup> He and his wife had dinner with Mr Cameron and Ms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Wade during the course of Mr Cameron&#8217;s brief visit on that occasion. Rupert Murdoch first</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">met Mr Cameron at a picnic hosted by his daughter Elisabeth.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref169" href="#footnote169">169</a></sup> Mr Cameron&#8217;s list of contacts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with media figures as Leader of the Opposition records six occasions on which Mr Cameron</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">met either one or both of the Freuds. Three of these occasions are listed as &#8220;social&#8221; contact</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the remainder as &#8220;dinner&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-120"><a href="#para2-120" name="para2-120">2.120</a></p>
 As relations warmed between Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks, so they appear to have
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cooled between Mr Brown and Mrs Brooks, at least professionally. Criticism of Mr Brown&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government increased and the subject of Afghanistan, in particular, became an issue on which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Sun was highly critical of Mr Brown. The title ran a campaign critical of the equipment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and resources being allocated to British forces in Afghanistan, reflecting Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strong views on the issue. One of the last headlines which Mrs Brooks published as the editor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of The Sun, on 28 August 2009, read &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Don&#8217;t</span><span style="font-style:italic"> you</span><span style="font-style:italic"> know</span><span style="font-style:italic"> there&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> bloody</span><span style="font-style:italic"> war</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on?&#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref170" href="#footnote170">170</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-121"><a href="#para2-121" name="para2-121">2.121</a></p>
 Rupert Murdoch,</span> James Murdoch, Mrs Brooks, Dominic<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Mohan, Trevor Kavanagh and Tom
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Newton Dunn were all involved in the discussions which led to the decision to abandon Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Brown.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref171" href="#footnote171">171</a></sup> The discussions appear to have begun around June 2009.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref172" href="#footnote172">172</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-122"><a href="#para2-122" name="para2-122">2.122</a></p>
 By 10</span> September<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009 the plan to switch support was sufficiently concrete for James
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch to meet Mr Cameron at The George and tell him that it was going to happen. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cameron described a short meeting of 30-40 minutes&#8217; duration. At that stage Mr Cameron</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not given the precise date on which the switch would be announced but he was given an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indication that it would be during the conference season. Mr Cameron recalled:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref173" href="#footnote173">173</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; It was a drink and a catch-up, but it was &#8211; he wanted to tell me that the Sun was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">going to support the Conservatives and he told me, I think, from my memory, that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it was going to happen around the time of the Labour conference, and I remember</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">obviously being pleased that the Conservative Party was going to get the Sun&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">support, and I think we had a conversation about other policy issues at the time.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">That&#8217;s my memory of it&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-123"><a href="#para2-123" name="para2-123">2.123</a></p>
 Mr Cameron could remember discussion of economic policy and defence but not mention of
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Conservativepolicy on eithertheBBC or Ofcom,about which JamesMurdoch had pronounced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">views. Both bodies had received trenchant criticism as recently as 28 August 2009 in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">controversial MacTaggart lecture that James Murdoch had delivered. Asked directly whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">either had been mentioned Mr Cameron said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref174" href="#footnote174">174</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. I don&#8217;t recall that, and I think it unlikely. I think that this was &#8211; he was very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">keen to tell me directly that the Sun was going to support the Conservatives, that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he felt on the big economic judgment about what Britain needed we had the right</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">argument, the government had the wrong argument, and my memory is that&#8217;s what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the conversation was about.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Yes, you said you had a conversation about other policy</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enthusiastic about defence. He takes the view we should have at least six aircraft</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">carriers, I think at the last count, rather than two, so he has lots of enthusiasms and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I&#8217;m sure we discussed some of those, but the key &#8211; my memory is, and it&#8217;s difficult</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to recall all of these events, I definitely remember him saying the Sun was going to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">support the Conservative Party. I wouldn&#8217;t forget that. I think he gave me a hint of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">timing, and my memory is it was mostly about the big economic picture, because that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was the key issue of the day&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-124"><a href="#para2-124" name="para2-124">2.124</a></p>

 The change,</span> when it came, was calculated to do maximum political damage to Mr Brown.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref176" href="#footnote176">176</a></sup>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It was announced through The Sun headline: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Labour&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Lost</span><span style="font-style:italic"> It&#8221;</span> , published on 30 September</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">choice of headline bore a significance that went beyond simply communicating the transfer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of The Sun&#8217;s political support, important though that was. The emphasis was placed heavily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the move away from Mr Brown personally rather than the shift towards Mr Cameron.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-126"><a href="#para2-126" name="para2-126">2.126</a></p>
 Mr Coulson would have preferred an endorsement of Mr Cameron timed to coincide with

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The allegation that the transfer of The Sun&#8217;s support to the Conservatives was the product of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a &#8216;deal&#8217; between News International and the Conservative Party was made publicly by Lord</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">weeks after The Sun&#8217;s about turn. He told the Inquiry that the basis for his view was what he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perceived to be a coincidence between the views expressed in James Murdoch&#8217;s MacTaggart</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lecture and Conservative media policy:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref188" href="#footnote188">188</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have to go very far to put two and two together to realise that this coincidence of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">policy had slightly greater meaning and that there was, in fact, a sort of organic link</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;At his [Mr Brown&#8217;s] urging I spoke out on that issue publicly on a couple of occasions</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">following the Sun&#8217;s switch. In fact, I suspected that the real reason for the change was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">simpler, and in a way even more discouraging. The Sun was a mass market paper. It</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">saw its interests as backing a winner. While I was still not convinced, or at least not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ready to accept, that a Tory victory at the next election was inevitable, given the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">yawning gap we would have to make up in the opinion polls, it was certainly looking</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that way&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span> .</span>

 Questioned about the apparent inconsistency, he said that his two statements were not
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mutually exclusive identifying two reasons why he thought that The Sun would have wanted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to support the Conservatives: a desire to back the likely winner and commercial self-interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of its proprietor. Lord Mandelson said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref190" href="#footnote190">190</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;First of all, I chose my words in finishing this book in 2010 without any prescience</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that I might be poring over it line by line, word by word with you in the course of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">justice, but secondly, and more seriously, two things were operating here, in my view:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">one, the Conservatives looked as if they were on the up and with a good chance of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">winning the election, and the Murdochs wouldn&#8217;t ignore it.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Secondly, they would have seen very clearly that their commercial interests would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have been suited more by a Conservative victory, given what Mr Cameron was saying</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in his own public speeches, than they would with a further Labour government, you</span>

<p id="para-id-2-135"><a href="#para2-135" name="para2-135">2.135</a></p>
 Whatever the reaction of the Conservative Party to James Murdoch&#8217;s views about media
<span style="font-size: 15px;">policy in the United Kingdom (and they are explored below), for his part Mr Brown reached the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">point where he felt it was no longer worth talking to News International about the subject:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref193" href="#footnote193">193</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It became very clear in the summer of 2009, when Mr Murdoch junior gave the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">MacTaggart lecture, that News International had a highly politicised agenda for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">changes that were in the media policy of this country, and there seemed to me very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">little point in talking to them about this.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-136"><a href="#para2-136" name="para2-136">2.136</a></p>
 Mr Brown provided an eleven point note to the Inquiry containing information and quotations
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the Murdochs and Conservatives on which he relied in support of his view that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Conservatives in opposition and in Government shaped their policy to match the demands</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of NewsCorp &#8211; on Ofcom, on the BBC, on TV advertising, on regulation and on the proposed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">takeover of BskyB<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref194" href="#footnote194">194</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-137"><a href="#para2-137" name="para2-137">2.137</a></p>
 Mr Cameron rejected the allegation:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref195" href="#footnote195">195</a></sup>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;To respond generally, and frankly it is absolute nonsense from start to finish. I think</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">where it comes from is obviously Gordon Brown was very angry and disappointed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the Sun had deserted him, and as a result, in my view, he has cooked up an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">entirely specious and unjustified conspiracy theory to try and, I don&#8217;t know, justify his</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">anger.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">But I&#8217;ve taken the time to look through the individual parts of policy that he points to,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and in almost every case it is complete nonsense.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Just to take a couple of examples, he makes the point about the listing of sporting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">events and particularly the Ashes, and actually it was the Labour government, his</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">government, that delisted the Ashes. He makes a point about us taking a particular</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">view on product placement. Again, it was a Labour government that started the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">process of changing the rules on product placement under his oversight.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">On the BBC, as I&#8217;ve argued before, my position on the BBC is not the same as James</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Murdoch&#8217;s position on the BBC. I support the BBC, I support the licence fee.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So the Conservative Party, I think, will be submitting a piece-by-piece response to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this because it is complete nonsense, but I&#8217;m very happy to go through the individual</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">parts. But, as I&#8217;ve said before, there was no overt deal for support, there was no covert</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deal, there were no nods and winks. There was a Conservative politician, me, trying</span>

<h3>David Cameron&#8217;s media policy and manifesto</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-138"><a href="#para2-138" name="para2-138">2.138</a></p>
 Having identified the stance taken by Mr Brown on the one hand and Mr Cameron on the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other, the matter can perhaps be left there. What will be important, however, is to examine</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether (and, if so, to what extent) the allegation that the relationship between the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(and, more particularly, News International) might legitimately be argued to have affected</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public policy decisions of the new administration. It is therefore appropriate to consider Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cameron&#8217;s media policy and relevant parts of his general election manifesto. In doing so this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subsection concentrates on policy towards the BBC and Ofcom. The BskyB bid is considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">elsewhere in this Report.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref196" href="#footnote196">196</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-139"><a href="#para2-139" name="para2-139">2.139</a></p>
 By the time of the general election of 2010,</span> the Conservative<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Party&#8217;s manifesto contained
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only a single paragraph about media policy and that concerned local media, particularly local</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">television:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref197" href="#footnote197">197</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Our plans to decentralise power will only work properly if there is a strong,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">independent and vibrant local media to hold local authorities to account. We will</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sweep away the rules that stop local newspapers owning other local media platforms</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and create a new network of local television stations&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-140"><a href="#para2-140" name="para2-140">2.140</a></p>
 Of relevance to the Conservative Party&#8217;s</span> policy towards the<span style="font-weight:normal;"> BBC, the manifesto contained
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a pledge relevant to its financing to:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;ensure</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> National</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Audit</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Office</span><span style="font-style:italic"> has</span><span style="font-style:italic"> full</span><span style="font-style:italic"> access</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span></span>

<a name="page1201"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">idea as to the use to which the BBC licence fee might be put, known as &#8220;top slicing&#8221;, which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was described in the document in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref200" href="#footnote200">200</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;One option is to consider whether other organisations should be allowed to bid for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">small parts of the licence fee. This would ensure a plurality of provision in key genres,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">such as daytime children&#8217;s TV and current affairs. However such a model would need</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to avoid the risk of distorting the commercial television market by mixing public and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">commercial funding, so it may be preferable for it to fund new channels rather than</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;top up&#8221; funding of existing channels.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-143"><a href="#para2-143" name="para2-143">2.143</a></p>
 In October of the same year Mr Cameron wrote an article about The Sun which was published
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under the headline &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Tory</span><span style="font-style:italic"> chief</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hits</span><span style="font-style:italic"> out</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8211;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Bloated</span><span style="font-style:italic"> BBC</span><span style="font-style:italic"> out</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> touch</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span><span style="font-style:italic"> viewers&#8221;</span> . It contained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both praise for and criticism of the BBC, expressing particular concern about the negative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impact which the BBC could have on small private sector competitors and proposing rules to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prevent that from happening. In support of the BBC he wrote:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I am a slightly rare creature &#8211; a lifelong Conservative who is a fan of the BBC.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I don&#8217;t just mean the quality stuff &#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">If I tot it all up: rummaging around the BBC news website, Radio 4 every morning,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Radio 5 on a Sunday, The Big Cat Diaries and whatever Andrew Davies has written up</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recently, I get a huge amount from the full range of what the BBC has to offer.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">And yes, I even approve of the way the BBC is funded.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-144"><a href="#para2-144" name="para2-144">2.144</a></p>
 Mr Cameron then critically observed that:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref201" href="#footnote201">201</a></sup>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve all seen in our own constituencies small internet businesses, often involved in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">education or other information provision, working away to create a market, to make</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">some money, and then the BBC comes along and squish, like a big foot on an ant, that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">business goes out&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">He proposed:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; a better set of rules that stops the BBC from charging in &#8230; and actually putting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other people who are struggling to provide a market, out of work&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We are fans of the BBC. In an uncertain world, the BBC provides a great resource</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for publicly-funded high-quality content. When looking for a solution to the future</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of public service broadcasting, we want one that is the least damaging to the BBC&#8217;s</span>

<a name="page1202"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Although we believe in plurality in public service broadcasting, we do not believe</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the solution to the challenges presented by the internet age is necessarily to try and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">create another BBC. Having said that, it is equally important that the BBC stop acting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">like a friendly monopolist, making noises about partnerships, and engages seriously</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in discussions about how to ensure plurality in public service broadcasting.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">On other matters: while we support the licence fee, and believe it is the best way to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fund the BBC for the foreseeable future, we believe the level of the licence fee is at the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">top end of what is acceptable to the public.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The current settlement &#8211; which began in 2006 and lasts to 2012 &#8211; built in increases of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">13 &#8211; 15% over that period. That was a generous settlement when times were good.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It may start to look prohibitive as times get increasingly bad. The BBC will have to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think very hard about whether substantial licence fee increases can be justified in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">coming years.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The BBC Trust, under Sir Michael Lyons, has done a good job, and I would like to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">congratulate him. So what follows is not personal, it is, as they say, business. We think</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that there needs to be a clearer divide between the regulation and management of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the BBC. The BBC and the BBC Trust should be clearly separate. The BBC should have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">its own chairman, who can cheer lead for the Corporation, while the head of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regulator gets on with regulating. A truly independent regulator would provide a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">genuine voice for the licence fee payer.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Moving on from that, the expansion of the BBC into areas where the private sector is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">already working needs to be carefully watched. Our watchword will be simple &#8211; if the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">private sector is already doing a good job in the area, or is developing a market in an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">area, the BBC should be prevented from going in with all guns blazing.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Finally, there is the issue of costs. The Ross/Brand row was not just about bad taste,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">though of course that was important. It was also about the huge amount of money</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the BBC is paying Jonathan Ross and other stars. A public service broadcaster with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">guaranteed revenue shouldn&#8217;t compete with the private sector on top talent salaries.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">In fact, I would go further and say the BBC actually pushes up the price of talent with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">its interventions. So we will ensure that the BBC publishes fully audited accounts which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">will include details of the salaries of all its top talent. The BBC should be prepared to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">defend salary and indeed all expenditure decisions it makes.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-146"><a href="#para2-146" name="para2-146">2.146</a></p>
 Significantly, Mr Vaizey went on to make clear that the Conservatives were already moving
<span style="font-size: 15px;">away from the idea of top-slicing the BBC&#8217;s licence fee. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref203" href="#footnote203">203</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There are the solutions that involve the BBC &#8211; straightforward top-slicing of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">licence fee; partnerships with the BBC and BBC Worldwide, or by using money</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ring-fenced for digital switchover; or the sharing of resources such as studios and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">technology.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Then there are the market solutions &#8211; a merger with Five, with BBC Worldwide,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">changing the terms of trade, or a combination of these.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We have been careful not to rule out any solution. But as I have indicated, we are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">less convinced about a solution that involves top slicing of the licence fee.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span></span>

 Two months later,</span> in March<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009,</span> in the context of an increasingly difficult economic<span style="font-weight:normal;"> climate,
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron personally returned to the question of the BBC&#8217;s funding. He announced that a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Conservative Government would freeze the licence fee:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref204" href="#footnote204">204</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;... solving Labour&#8217;s Debt Crisis by making sure government lives within its means and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">delivers more for less. And it&#8217;s not just government that has to live within its means</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; we all do.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So today, I want to make an announcement that shows our expectation that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">government and all taxpayer-funded institutions should start leading by example.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The BBC is one of our most important national institutions. It plays a vital role in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bringing the country together, and I want to see it prosper and succeed and continue</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to be a fantastic cultural asset for Britain.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">But it also needs to maintain public support, and I want to see it leading by example</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at a time when the whole country is tightening its belt.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">And so I can announce today that we would freeze the BBC licence fee for one year.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think that would be an important signal to the country of the need for all public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">institutions, in these difficult economic circumstances, to do more with less.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-148"><a href="#para2-148" name="para2-148">2.148</a></p>
 In April 2009, the Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt MP launcheda review of the creative industries
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which was chaired by former BBC Director General, Greg Dyke. It was one of a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Conservative Party task forces formed in Opposition. Its work was still ongoing at the time</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the general election. Elisabeth Murdoch, as CEO and Chairman of the Shine Group, was a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">member of the task force, one amongst a number of eminent industry figures.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref205" href="#footnote205">205</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-149"><a href="#para2-149" name="para2-149">2.149</a></p>
 In October 2009,</span> Mr Hunt told the Financial Times that he did not support<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Labour&#8217;s plan for
<span style="font-size: 15px;">state supported local television news on ITV, financed by top slicing the licence fee. On the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">topic of the ambit of the BBC&#8217;s activities and competition he also said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref206" href="#footnote206">206</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It might sound well and good for [the BBC] to have, say, an angling website, but if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it drove out of business every angling magazine in the country, you would have to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">question if it was the right sort of thing to do&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-150"><a href="#para2-150" name="para2-150">2.150</a></p>
 It was Mr Hunt also ultimately made clear that the Conservatives had rejected top slicing. On
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Conservative Party website, he posted: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> top-slicing&#8230;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> We</span><span style="font-style:italic"> floated</span><span style="font-style:italic"> this</span><span style="font-style:italic"> idea</span><span style="font-style:italic"> two</span><span style="font-style:italic"> years</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ago and rejected it&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref207" href="#footnote207">207</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-151"><a href="#para2-151" name="para2-151">2.151</a></p>
 In the result,</span> when in<span style="font-weight:normal;"> power, the Coalition Government froze the BBC licence fee as Mr

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cameron had promised to do. Mr Cameron was keen to point out that the imposition of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">freeze left the BBC better off than many in the current climate of austerity and that the policy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had fallen far short of what James Murdoch was advocating:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref208" href="#footnote208">208</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; We froze the licence fee, much to the anger of James Murdoch, who I think &#8211; I think</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Chancellor George Osborne [said] thought that it should have been cut. So we had</span>

<a name="page1204"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">our own policy on the BBC licence fee which I think had been fair and reasonable to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the BBC when other organisations have had their budgets cut be considerably more.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So, again, this part of the conspiracy theory I think has absolutely no weight at all&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-152"><a href="#para2-152" name="para2-152">2.152</a></p>
 Mr Cameron rejected the suggestion that in imposing the freeze he had been meeting
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Murdoch half way. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref209" href="#footnote209">209</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s quite difficult to argue, at a time when you know if you get into government</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you&#8217;re going to have to be making spending reductions, that you&#8217;re going to see the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">BBC licence fee go up and up and up, and I think we had a consistent and long-term</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">argument, which very much flowed from my own views formed at Carlton, that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">BBC needed to be strong, it needed the backing of the licence fee. I do think the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">BBC had gone into areas it shouldn&#8217;t have done, and I mention that in some of my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">evidence, but I think this is a fair settlement for the BBC and it&#8217;s certainly not one that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">James Murdoch supported.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-153"><a href="#para2-153" name="para2-153">2.153</a></p>
 Mr Osborne recalled James Murdoch&#8217;s reaction to the decision to freeze the licence fee in
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref210" href="#footnote210">210</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, I remember &#8211; this was a very specifically about the BBC licence fee, rather</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">than &#8211; as I say, James Murdoch would often let us have his views in public as well as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in private about his view about the BBC, but specifically about the licence fee and our</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decision in October 2010 to freeze the licence fee but not to dismantle it, and indeed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to, in effect, continue for the next five or six years with the current structure of BBC</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">funding.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Now, as I say in this statement, I cannot remember exactly how this conversation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">took place, and it may well have been on the phone, because it&#8217;s not obvious that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there was a meeting where this would have had &#8211; but I have a pretty clear memory</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of him being quite angry about our &#8211; the decision we had taken, and I explained to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">him why I thought it was the right decision and why, in any case &#8211; you know, we had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">always made it clear that we were not setting out to dismantle the BBC or radically</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cut the licence fee or distribute the licence fee in a different way, but he was clearly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">disappointed with that decision&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-154"><a href="#para2-154" name="para2-154">2.154</a></p>
 Commenting on James Murdoch&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009</span> MacTaggart<span style="font-weight:normal;"> lecture, Mr Osborne later made clear
<span style="font-size: 15px;">how significant were the differences between the Conservative Party and Mr Murdoch on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the BBC:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref211" href="#footnote211">211</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I disagreed with him, basically, and certainly David Cameron also disagreed with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">him, and I think &#8211; you know, he had been agitating for some dramatic change in the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">funding of the BBC or the structure of the BBC and he was not going to get that from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">the Conservatives&#8221;.</span>
<h4>Ofcom</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-155"><a href="#para2-155" name="para2-155">2.155</a></p>
 The attitude adopted by Mr Cameron to Ofcom has to be viewed in the overall context of
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his policy on quangos generally which, in his words, was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> redistribute</span><span style="font-style:italic"> power</span><span style="font-style:italic"> away</span><span style="font-style:italic"> from</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom as an example, he said during the course of a major speech delivered on 9 July 2009:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref212" href="#footnote212">212</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I have asked the Shadow Cabinet to review every independent public body that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">currently sits within their portfolio. For each one, they will be asking the key questions:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Does this organisation need to exist?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">If its functions are necessary, which of them should be carried out in a directly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">accountable way within the department?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">And which, if any, should be carried out independently, at arm&#8217;s length from political</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">influence?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">If there really is a need for an independent quango, how can we make sure it is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as small as possible, operating with maximum efficiency, frugality and respect for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">taxpayers&#8217; money?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">That process of review will go on up to and beyond the election. But today, I want to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">give you an idea of the scale of change we envisage by setting out what our approach</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would mean for three specific quangos.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">OFCOM is the regulator for the communications industry, and it&#8217;s clear that it has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an important technical function. It monitors the plurality of media provision for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consumers. It licenses the spectrum in the UK. And it sets the charges and the price</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">caps for BT&#8217;s control of so much of the industry&#8217;s infrastructure. OFCOM also has an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enforcement function &#8211; ruling on breaches of the broadcasting code for instance.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">These matters relate to the operations of private companies in a commercial market</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and it is therefore right that they are free from political influence.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">But Jeremy Hunt has concluded that OFCOM currently has many other responsibilities</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that are matters of public policy, in areas that should be part of a national debate, for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">example the future of regional news or Channel 4. These should not be determined</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by an unaccountable bureaucracy, but by minsters [sic] accountable to Parliament.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So with a Conservative Government, OFCOM as we know it will cease to exist. Its remit</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">will be restricted to its narrow technical and enforcement roles. It will no longer play a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">role in making policy. And the policy-making functions it has today will be transferred</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">back fully to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-2-156"><a href="#para2-156" name="para2-156">2.156</a></p>
 It is important to note from the speech that although Mr Cameron was proposing that
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Ofcom</span><span style="font-style:italic"> as</span><span style="font-style:italic"> we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> know</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> will</span><span style="font-style:italic"> cease</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> exist</span> &#8221; what he was referring to was the repatriation of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">policy functions back to a central Government department. There was no proposal to dilute</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom&#8217;s technical regulatory functions which the speech expressly recognised should remain</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Ofcom and at arm&#8217;s length from political influence.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-157"><a href="#para2-157" name="para2-157">2.157</a></p>
 Mr Cameron explained that the decision to use Ofcom as an example was simplya matter of
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his familiarity with it and had nothing to do with any external influence. He also pointed out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that at the time Ofcom was the subject of criticism from diverse quarters:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref213" href="#footnote213">213</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;One of the reasons I picked Ofcom was because of my own experience from television</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of remembering what the Independent Television Commission had done, the ITC, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">precursor of Ofcom, and also remembering the sort of levels of pay that there were in</span>

<a name="page1206"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the ITC compared with Ofcom, and I did think Ofcom was quite a good example of a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">quango that had got too big, too expensive, and the pay levels were pretty excessive.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I would just make the point &#8211; I&#8217;ll shut up in a second &#8211; but at this time Ofcom was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">being actually roundly attacked on this basis by ITV, by the BBC, with which it had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">almost nothing to do, and also by commentators on the left of politics like Andrew</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Rawnsley, who were all saying Ofcom seems to have got too big and too bureaucratic.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So this was an agenda that was very limited to my own views, not in any way proposed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or dictated by others&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-158"><a href="#para2-158" name="para2-158">2.158</a></p>
 Mr Osborne confirmed that the Conservative Party&#8217;s concerns about Ofcom were those
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which it had about quangos in general and did not relate to its media regulatory function:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref214" href="#footnote214">214</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of Ofcom. Did that chime at all with your policy?&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I never discussed with him Ofcom and I don&#8217;t remember personally being involved in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any great internal discussion within the Conservative Party about the future of Ofcom.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There was a general concern that Ofcom had become, like many Quangos, rather</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bloated, but that was not a complaint about the function of Ofcom, just that like</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">many parts of government, that there had not been a proper regard for cost.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-159"><a href="#para2-159" name="para2-159">2.159</a></p>
 In the result,</span> Mr Cameron explained the impact of Coalition Government on Ofcom<span style="font-weight:normal;"> policy:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref215" href="#footnote215">215</a></sup>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. To take the story forward, as it were, is this right, that the reason this policy was not</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. That&#8217;s right. I wasn&#8217;t involved in the detailed negotiation of the Coalition</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">agreement, but some policies made it through, others didn&#8217;t, and I suspect this is one</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that we didn&#8217;t get agreement on, but we have taken action on pay levels in quangos</span>

<h3>The 2010 General Election campaign</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-160"><a href="#para2-160" name="para2-160">2.160</a></p>
 The 2010 election campaign of course involved all of the contenders doing their utmost
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to get their competing political messages across using the media, including new media,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and otherwise. Mr Cameron had won the much coveted support of News International&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politically variable titles. He had secured the &#8216;full throttled&#8217; support of the centre right press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and enjoyed the support of those other politically uncommitted media titles, the Economist</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the Financial Times. But the endorsement of The Sun did not bring outright victory.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-161"><a href="#para2-161" name="para2-161">2.161</a></p>
 The political commentator Andrew Neil attributed the outcome toa number of factors: the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">declining political influence of The Sun; the lack of a long period of sustained press support for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron before the election; the overshadowing of newspapers generally by television</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, in particular, the introduction for the first time in the United Kingdom, of televised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">leaders&#8217; debates during the campaign. Thought provokingly, he wrote:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref216" href="#footnote216">216</a></sup></span>

<a name="page1207"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Ihave alreadyreferred(para4)tothe factthat, despite the overwhelmingendorsement</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of what we still refer to as Fleet Street, Mr Cameron was unable to win an overall</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">majority in 2010, even though the circumstances were widely regarded as propitious</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for the Tories. The Sun is a shadow of the political influence it enjoyed in the 1980s,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">peaking in the close-run election of 1992. In the 1997 and 2001 elections it largely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">piggy-backed on the Blair landslides: it needed to back Mr Blair to show it was in touch</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with its readers much more than Mr Blair needed its backing (though he did not realise</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that at the time since he was still obsessed with what had happened to Neil Kinnock).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Sun was following the crowd rather than telling it what to think. In 2005 the Sun</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was largely irrelevant because it took so long to make up its mind and by then had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">become half-hearted in its support of New Labour. In 2010 it backed Mr Cameron,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">though only in the autumn before a spring election, which did not give it time to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">get strongly behind him. Mr Cameron&#8217;s hopes of an overall majority faded the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more the Sun cheer-led for him; he did not win. Like other newspapers the Sun was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">overshadowed by the leaders&#8217; debates on prime-time TV and unfolding events on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">news channels, replayed every night to much larger audiences on network news. The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Guardian and other left-leaning papers backed the Liberal Democrats: they lost seats.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Newspapers and their proprietors still have what many regard as an inordinate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">influence on our politics because politicians chose to confer it on them, despite</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">increasing evidence it is not merited. Press proprietor-politician relationships will be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">transformed, many would say for the better, when the political elite realise that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">emperors have no clothes, or are at most scantily clad.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-162"><a href="#para2-162" name="para2-162">2.162</a></p>
 Mr Osborne agreed that the support of The Sun,</span> although important, was<span style="font-weight:normal;"> not, and probably
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had never been, determinative, saying:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref217" href="#footnote217">217</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; I think the endorsement of the Sun has been elevated to almost mythical status. It</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was just one of a whole range of things we felt we had to get right in the run up to a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">General Election, and ultimately, if we had not had the endorsement of the Sun I think</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we still would have gone on and done well in the General Election&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-163"><a href="#para2-163" name="para2-163">2.163</a></p>
 He further explained why he thought that the role played by support from the Economist and
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Financial Times was significant:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I remember also that it was significant we had the endorsement of the Financial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Times and the Economist, both publications I think previously at various points had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">supported the Labour Party. They don&#8217;t have mass readerships, but they bring a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">different kind of cachet.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Before concluding:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref218" href="#footnote218">218</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;So I think in all this process, and I think maybe it stems back to the 1992 election and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">some of the mythology around that &#8211; there is this feeling that the Sun endorsement</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is all you need to win a general election, and I would say it is far from that, and I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">certainly think you could win an election without the endorsement of the Sun&#8221;.</span>

<h2>3. Prime Minister Cameron: 2010-present</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There has been a significant and inevitable diminution in Mr Cameron&#8217;s personal engagement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the media once in office. Comparison of the lists of meetings which he provided for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the periods as Leader of the Opposition and as Prime Minister showed that the number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contacts halved from approximately 26 meetings or interviews per month to 13. There was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a simple and compelling explanation for this change in the tempo of media engagement, as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref219" href="#footnote219">219</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;As I say, when I was elected, I did try to do less of this and try to have more of a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">distance, try to make sure &#8211; because genuinely when you&#8217;re in opposition, what are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you doing? You&#8217;re campaigning, you&#8217;re drawing up policies, you&#8217;re trying to convince</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people. In government, it is and should be different. You should be spending your time</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">governing, not talking about governing, so I did try to create some more distance, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as I explained earlier I think it&#8217;s very difficult because of these daily battles that you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">fight&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is clear that Mr Cameron did very consciously change his approach to the press between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Opposition and Government. He had some observations about the process:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref220" href="#footnote220">220</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Yes. I think it&#8217;s right that in government you&#8217;re making real decisions rather than just</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">policy ideas and campaigns, so it&#8217;s more important that what you do is done properly.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">And that&#8217;s why you have special advisers&#8217; codes, ministerial codes and all the rest of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it. But I do think there is &#8211; when you&#8217;re leader of the opposition, and I did the job for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">five years, it&#8217;s only in the last year you get the sort of Civil Service machine starting to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">talk to you about how you&#8217;d translate your structure and your processes into Number</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">10 Downing Street, and I think there could be a strength in &#8211; I don&#8217;t believe in having</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a sort of official opposition office, as it were, but I think there could be a strength in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">having earlier discussions between the Cabinet Secretary or the Permanent Secretary</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at Number 10 with a new leader of the opposition, just to make them aware of some</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the processes and practices that might assist them in the work that they do and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">avoiding any conflicts and the rest of it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The latter is an interesting point. I can see that it might even have a potential to reduce</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the risk, which Mr Campbell felt had eventuated in 1997, of an opposition party carrying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the media tactics of Opposition into Government. The same outcome, however, can also be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approached (or assisted) by a more open and transparent approach to the press. I shall return</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to this issue when analysing possible ways forward.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Asked whether media engagement in Government occupied time at the expense of policy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">formation, leadership and Government, Mr Cameron described how he sought to arrange his</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">private office at No 10 Downing Street to reflect the extra distance from the media which he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sought so as to be able to concentrate on Government:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref221" href="#footnote221">221</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t, but it can. I think the way I&#8217;ve explained the 24-hour news agenda,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">when I arrived in Downing Street, I did think that the set-up was quite geared to 24-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hour news. It felt too much like a newsroom, and that&#8217;s what the press department</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of arrangements where you can think, take decisions, prepare for decisions properly,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">structure your day so you&#8217;re not permanently in a sort of news warfare mode, if I can</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">put it that way.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The risk which Mr Cameron was seeking to avoid, and which he graphically described in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the quotation as news warfare mode, was of spending a disproportionate amount of time</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">engaging with what is now a truly 24 hour, multi-media news cycle. It is the challenge which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">faces all current and future politicians. Establishing and maintaining both healthy boundaries</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and sufficient distance in this environment is not easy when what is published and broadcast</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can, at least over time, be so influential to a political party&#8217;s fortunes. Mr Cameron accepted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he had not always been wholly successful in resisting the demands of the 24 hour news</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cycle. This was the exchange with Counsel to the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref222" href="#footnote222">222</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. You refer to having a bit more distance. That depends, I suppose, on each party</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the debate, as it were, having a sense of propriety as to what is right and where</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the boundaries are. Are we agreed about that?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I think that&#8217;s right, but distance is also about for the politician, and this relates</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the issue of the 24-hour news cycle. There is a difficulty in &#8211; I&#8217;m not expecting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sympathy for this, but there&#8217;s a difficulty in politics that you are fighting a sort of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">permanent battle of issues being thrown at you hour by hour where responses are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">demanded incredibly quickly, and it can, if you&#8217;re not careful, take up all your energy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in dealing with that, and that is hopeless, because if that&#8217;s what you spend your</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">time doing, you will never reform our schools, cut our deficit, deal with our economic</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">problems and all the rest of it.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">When I say distance, partly what I mean is that the politicians, and particularly prime</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ministers and Cabinet ministers, have to get out of the 24-hour news cycle, not try and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fight every hourly battle, and focus on long-term issues and be prepared sometimes</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to take a hit on a story they don&#8217;t respond to so quickly.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">That&#8217;s very easy to say that, but I did actually try on getting into Number 10 Downing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Street to do that. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s always been totally successful, but that&#8217;s part of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what I mean by distance. It means not sitting under a 24-hour news television screen</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">looking at the ticker and worrying about what&#8217;s happening every hour. If you do that,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you get completely buried by the daily news agenda.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Focusing more specifically on newspapers, Mr Cameron explained how technological change</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has affected the content of printed news coverage, forcing it away from its historic model</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which focused on reporting the previous day&#8217;s news:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref223" href="#footnote223">223</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; I think a lot of evidence that&#8217;s been put forward in the sessions you&#8217;ve had where</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people have talked about the growth of the 24-hour news culture, the fact that things</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">move so fast that I think newspapers have been put in a difficult position, because</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the news has been made and reported long before they reach their deadlines and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they publish their papers the next day, so I think newspapers have moved more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">towards trying to find impact, trying to find an angle on a story, rather than, as would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have been the case before 24-hour news and all the rest of it, of just reporting what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">happened the day before.</span>

<a name="page1210"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So I think there has been a change, but I think that&#8217;s quite a lot to do with technology</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the development of the media rather than anything else.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">From the politician&#8217;s perspective he considered this development to have been certainly one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which has brought challenges:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref224" href="#footnote224">224</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think from the politicians&#8217; point of view, and particularly perhaps from the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">government&#8217;s point of view, it&#8217;s sometimes a change for the worse, because if there&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a big announcement, something we think is very important, that gets announced on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the television, it gets picked over by the 24-hour news, and it&#8217;s quite understandable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the newspapers, by the time they come out the next day, have to find something</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">different, and I completely understand why they want to do that, but from the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">perspective of trying to explain to the country why you&#8217;re making difficult decisions,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">why you&#8217;re reforming the health service in this way, why you&#8217;re trying to cut the deficit</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in that way and get across more what it is you actually decided to do rather than an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">endless analysis of what the motives were or what the splits were or whatever, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">politicians will always complain about this sort of thing, so I wouldn&#8217;t put too much</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">weight on it&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Osborne explained how he and Mr Cameron had drawn lessons from New Labour&#8217;s media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strategy in the early days of the New Labour Government and confirmed that there was less</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">emphasis in Government on fighting for every headline than there had been in Opposition.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He pointed out, though, that the proliferation of news sources has in any event now made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such an endeavour impossible. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref225" href="#footnote225">225</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;This is going to sound like talking my own book, but it also, I think, is genuinely the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">case. I think New Labour were very aggressive, when they became the government,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in pursuing the media management techniques they had developed in opposition.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">And they had developed those techniques in opposition, to be fair to them, because</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the way people like Neil Kinnock had been treated by all the press beforehand.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Now, we learnt, in a way, from that. We were &#8211; we came of political age &#8211; myself,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">David Cameron and others &#8211; during that political period, and we felt too that that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">government in its early years had been too obsessive about tomorrow&#8217;s headline and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">tried to control every aspect of the media.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">That&#8217;s not to say when we came into government, we didn&#8217;t want to have a good</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and effective media operation, but we were more relaxed about fighting for every</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">single headline or fighting for every news bulletin, and I think there is also partly an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">understanding on our behalf that in what has become, even over that period, a much</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more fragmented media, it is impossible to manage every single headline or fight for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">every headline. In the end, we had a belief that &#8211; we came into government, we had</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to set out some difficult things we needed to do and we would trust ultimately to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">judgment of the public but also trust to the judgment of the media, even if along the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">line you got some bad headlines.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Certainly, I have been more relaxed as Chancellor of the Exchequer in that early period</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">than I would have been as Shadow Chancellor about some the headlines we&#8217;ve had.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">That was not to say, however, that there had not still been a close relationship between the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press and the Coalition Government under Mr Cameron&#8217;s leadership. Mr Osborne described</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">calling editors and proprietors often:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref226" href="#footnote226">226</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; I often make calls to editors and proprietors after Major Treasury announcements</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and fiscal events which the diary records as a single block of time for &#8220;calls to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">editors&#8221;&#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-10"><a href="#para3-10" name="para3-10">3.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron candidly accepted that political news management strategies had not always</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been unambiguously in the public interest, and not just those of other political parties. When</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">asked whether he had seen evidence of attempts to control the news agenda by politicians in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his own party through favouritism and anonymous briefings, he replied:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref227" href="#footnote227">227</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220; Yes. These things do happen and it&#8217;s deeply regrettable. I think as long as there&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been a press and politicians these things happen. But it is very regrettable, it often</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">makes running a political party more difficult, running a government more difficult.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">It&#8217;s deeply destructive.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think there are degrees of this. Of course, you know, some politicians have journalists</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they have a particular good relationship with, they think they&#8217;re going to understand</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a particular speech or a particular idea better than others, and in this world where the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapers aren&#8217;t reporting yesterday&#8217;s news, because that&#8217;s already been reported,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">clearly newspapers are looking for something special, they&#8217;re looking for a particular</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">angle or a particular story.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So there are responsible ways of handling media relations in that way, but briefing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">against people, doing people down, there are some dreadful things that have been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">done in politics on both sides in recent years, and they&#8217;re very, very regrettable.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(emphasis added)</span>

<p id="para-id-3-11"><a href="#para3-11" name="para3-11">3.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As for a solution to the problem, Mr Cameron agreed that there was no single panacea, that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a mixture of rules and culture were required and that political leaders themselves needed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">put a halt to bad practice and a poor culture.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref228" href="#footnote228">228</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-12"><a href="#para3-12" name="para3-12">3.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A good start has already been made so far as transparency is concerned. On 15 July 2011, Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cameron was responsible for the amendment of the Ministerial Code requiring Ministers to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disclose their meetings with media proprietors, editors and senior executives. The relevant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">addendum to the Code reads:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Government will be open about its links with the media. All meetings with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspaper and other proprietors, editors and senior executives will be published</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">quarterly regardless of the purpose of the meeting&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-13"><a href="#para3-13" name="para3-13">3.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The current practice is that all Government departments compile the information required</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the Ministerial Code set out above and give details of the month the meeting took place,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the name of the individual and organisation meeting the Minister, and the purpose of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meeting. Each list is available for public inspection on the relevant departmental website (as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">part of a wider list of Ministers&#8217; meetings with external organisations), as well as via links on</span>

<p id="para-id-3-14"><a href="#para3-14" name="para3-14">3.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron has made public the fact of his Ministerial meetings with media proprietors,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editors and senior executives since the 2010 General Election, regardless of the nature of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the meeting.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref230" href="#footnote230">230</a></sup> It has been an important step forward and transparency is an issue to which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I shall return.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-15"><a href="#para3-15" name="para3-15">3.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Amendment of the Ministerial Code was undoubtedly a very important step towards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">affording the transparency that is going to be vital if public trust in the relationship between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">our national press and politicians is to be rebuilt. An important issue is whether it would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be desirable to go further. On that question Mr Cameron thought that there was room for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">improvement. His view was:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref231" href="#footnote231">231</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think there are improvements we can make here. I think the idea that someone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">suggested of a sort of written note of every interaction with every editor, every</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">broadcast &#8211; I think that would be overly bureaucratic because most of the meetings</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are pretty similar. You&#8217;re explaining why you&#8217;re in favour of free schools and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">academies and how to get that message across, and why the policy&#8217;s a good idea.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">You&#8217;re explaining something that you&#8217;ve already published.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">But where I think there is potential for improvement is in two areas. If it&#8217;s obvious</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that this is a meeting where the proprietor or the broadcasting business or what have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you has got some, you know, commercial issues they want to raise, then I think it does</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">make sense that a note is taken. Or, if in a meeting that&#8217;s really about your policies</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and your approach and the rest of it, there&#8217;s a discussion about commercial interests,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">then I think again in government, you know, under the Ministerial Code, I think it&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">probably right that the minister or the politician should make a reference to that to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the private secretary.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-16"><a href="#para3-16" name="para3-16">3.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He also warned against an excessively bureaucratic approach which might easily become</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">counter-productive:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref232" href="#footnote232">232</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The problem with all this is the more rules and codes we create, the more difficult</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it is to make sure in every instance that people abide by them. I don&#8217;t want to create</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a system that doesn&#8217;t work, that is permanently broken. That would actually sap</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the faith of the public in this whole area. But I think some modest additions to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Ministerial Code to deal with the two points I&#8217;ve made, I think that is something we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could certainly look at.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-17"><a href="#para3-17" name="para3-17">3.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have no hesitation in endorsing the proposal that consideration should be given to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enhancing the Ministerial Code so as to require a note to be taken at meetings with media</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">proprietors, editors and senior executives at which their commercial interests are discussed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that should such an issue be raised in the course of a meeting with a different purpose, of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which a note is not being taken, then that issue should be reported to the Minister&#8217;s private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">secretary. Indeed, as I have said, I believe that it is appropriate to go further and I shall return</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations to make.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-18"><a href="#para3-18" name="para3-18">3.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A consequence of Mr Cameron&#8217;s contact with the media throughout his career, and in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his private life, is that he has formed many friendships with people in the media. When</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compiling the lists of those media figures with whom he had had contact both as Leader of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Opposition and in Government, there are some whom he had met so often that it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impractical to list contacts individually. Instead he identified them:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref233" href="#footnote233">233</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There is a small number of journalists who are close friends of mine and who I see</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">so frequently that I have not included them systematically in these lists, namely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Daniel Finkelstein, Alice Thomson and Sarah Vine from The Times, Xan Smiley and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Christopher Lockwood from The Economist, and Robert Hardman from The Daily</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mail. While my contacts are mainly social, they are also people with whom I discuss</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">politics and particular projects, such as speeches.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-19"><a href="#para3-19" name="para3-19">3.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The number of such friends demonstrates that Mrs Brooks was not alone amongst media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">figures with whom Mr Cameron socialised. Mr Smiley is a neighbour of Mr Cameron&#8217;s and Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finkelstein a former Conservative Party Parliamentary candidate, giving some indication of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the diverse ways in which Mr Cameron has formed these media friendships. It is a convenient</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">point at which to emphasise that there is absolutely nothing wrong with friendships between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians and journalists and that they will inevitably be close contact between the two</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which result in friendships. That is not only perfectly normal, it is good. It is worth repeating:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is not friendship that is relevant to the Terms of Reference but, rather, the way in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what the politicians have described as &#8216;overly close&#8217; relationships can impact on policy and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the needs of transparency to ensure that this becomes apparent.</span>

<h3>Relations with Telegraph Media Group</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-20"><a href="#para3-20" name="para3-20">3.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Naturally, Mr Cameron continued to make efforts to retain the very strong links which he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fostered with the Telegraph Media Group (TMG) in Opposition. He has met with a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">senior executives and editors on a number of occasions since the election.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref234" href="#footnote234">234</a></sup> Aidan Barclay&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">business interests are very much wider than TMG and so there are additional reasons why he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is an important person for Mr Cameron to remain in contact with. There have been two face-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to-face meetings since the election, in the period covered by disclosure to the Inquiry, which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">well illustrate how Mr Cameron has continued to engage in a mixture of formal and informal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contact with senior media figures. On 6 July 2010 there was a meeting at No 10 Downing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Street for general discussion followed by drinks.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref235" href="#footnote235">235</a></sup> To put this meeting into context, it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one of a number of meetings with media proprietors and senior media executives which Mr</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cameron had in the months immediately after he became Prime Minister.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref236" href="#footnote236">236</a></sup> Mr Barclay was</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of comparisons that might be made. Media proprietors certainly do enjoy a good level of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">access generally to our political leaders.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-22"><a href="#para3-22" name="para3-22">3.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition to the face-to-face meetings, Mr Barclay and Mr Cameron have continued</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occasionally to communicate by SMS text message. Only two of Mr Barclay&#8217;s post-election</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">texts disclosed to the Inquiry concerned a substantive issue and reflected Mr Barclay&#8217;s interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the macro-economic situation. One of Mr Barclay&#8217;s texts read:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref239" href="#footnote239">239</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;David im sure your aware [sic] that the credit markets are not good and are likely</span>

<p id="para-id-3-23"><a href="#para3-23" name="para3-23">3.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The other contained advice for Mr Cameron:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Suggest therefor Bank of England announce extension to liquidity scheme allow</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Banks say 5yrs to implement Basle 3 and if you can scrap talk of Bank Tax other</span>

<p id="para-id-3-24"><a href="#para3-24" name="para3-24">3.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron explained how this was one of a number of economic views which he had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">received and, coming from informed sources, they were useful. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref241" href="#footnote241">241</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Yes. I think this was the view of him, you know, not really as chairman of a newspaper</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">groupbutaschairmanofabigbusinessheavilyinvestedintothe UK withlotsofproperty</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and other businesses and this was his strong views about the financial situation and I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think it&#8217;s perfectly legitimate. I get a lot of exposure to businesses&#8217; views on these sorts</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of points, some by text, many more by the meetings I have, and that seems to me not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a bad thing, as long as you can order them properly in your mind.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-25"><a href="#para3-25" name="para3-25">3.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The contact was of a kind which is unexceptionable but the use of text messaging highlights</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">just how, in the age of informal electronic communications, policy issues are easily discussed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privately without the need for a face-to-face conversation. As already discussed, Mr Cameron</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has proposed that any contact relating to the commercial interests of a media company which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occurs should be noted, if it is pre-planned, and reported to a Minister&#8217;s private secretary if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it occurs spontaneously. It is difficult to see any difference in principle if the same sort of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">communication takes place by text, email or telephone. I shall also return to this issue when</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">discussing the way forward.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref242" href="#footnote242">242</a></sup></span>

<h4>Rupert Murdoch</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-26"><a href="#para3-26" name="para3-26">3.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first of four post-election meetings between Mr Cameron and Rupert Murdoch took place</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on 18 May 2010, shortly after Mr Cameron became Prime Minister. Mr Cameron explained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">how the meeting came about and gave his recollection of events which was as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref243" href="#footnote243">243</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The reason for Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s visit was that he was in London and in common</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with the reasons for my other meetings with newspaper proprietors and senior media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">executives, to set out the challenges that I and my Government saw the country</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">facing and our broad approach to addressing them. I also wanted to thank him for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">his support. As far as I can recall, this meeting covered similar ground to my other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">meetings with newspaper proprietors and senior media executives at the time.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(emphasis added)</span>

<p id="para-id-3-27"><a href="#para3-27" name="para3-27">3.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Murdoch recalled a short meeting at which he told Mr Cameron that his titles would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">watching closely to ensure that campaign promises were kept:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref244" href="#footnote244">244</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;I do recall that, shortly after his election, Mr Cameron invited me in for tea at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">No.10 Downing Street, he thanked me for the support of our papers; I congratulated</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">him and told him that I was sure our titles would watch carefully and report whether</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he kept all of his campaign promises. The meeting lasted at most 20 minutes...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-28"><a href="#para3-28" name="para3-28">3.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He also recalled that Mr Coulson<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> present&#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref245" href="#footnote245">245</a></sup> Mr Coulson was certainly at No 10 when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the meeting occurred. He recalled that: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> met</span><span style="font-style:italic"> him</span><span style="font-style:italic"> when</span><span style="font-style:italic"> he</span><span style="font-style:italic"> arrived</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> took</span><span style="font-style:italic"> him</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Prime Minister&#8217;s office. I didn&#8217;t sit in on the meeting which I think lasted around 30 minutes.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Afterwards I met him later in the corridor and we had a brief conversation.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref246" href="#footnote246">246</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-29"><a href="#para3-29" name="para3-29">3.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commentators have observed that Mr Murdoch had been admitted to Number 10 otherwise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than through the famous front door and speculated as to the reason for that, suggesting that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was a desire to keep the meeting low key. Mr Cameron said that he was not involved in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the arrangements but explained that No 10 has a number of entrances which frequently are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and have been used by visitors now and in the past by previous administrations.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref247" href="#footnote247">247</a></sup> There is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also a car park to the rear. Mr Murdoch&#8217;s evidence on the subject was somewhat equivocal,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but a desire to avoid photographers appears to have played a part:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref248" href="#footnote248">248</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. On that occasion and possibly other occasions you go in through the back door,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is that right?</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">photographed going out the front door or I don&#8217;t want to be, but it also happens to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be a shortcut to my apartment, so it&#8217;s quite okay&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. All right. Why do you think &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. And the car park [sic] is usually parked behind there, there&#8217;s a car park behind 10</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and 11 Downing Street.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-30"><a href="#para3-30" name="para3-30">3.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whatever the precise reason, the fact of the meeting was disclosed by Mr Cameron in his first</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">quarterly release of general external meetings on 28 October 2010.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref249" href="#footnote249">249</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-31"><a href="#para3-31" name="para3-31">3.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The other three meetings included a dinner with Mayor Bloomberg, in New York, on 21 July</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010, the News Corp summer party on 16 June 2011, which is attended by a large number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians, amongst others, and the Times CEO summit dinner at which Mr Cameron was the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">keynote speaker.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref250" href="#footnote250">250</a></sup> Of the dinner in New York, Mr Coulson said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref251" href="#footnote251">251</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The second post-election meeting with Rupert Murdoch was in New York on the day</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mayor Bloomberg organised a party in honour of the Prime Minister. Before the party</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Rupert Murdoch met David Cameron for around half an hour. He and I met briefly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">when he arrived, but I did not sit in on the meeting. In the evening, before the dinner,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I had a longer conversation with Rupert Murdoch and his wife Wendi at the drinks</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reception. From memory we mostly discussed American politics&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-32"><a href="#para3-32" name="para3-32">3.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not surprising that Mr Murdoch and Mr Cameron have not met since July 2011 when the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking scandal reached its apex. It is also right to observe that despite the election support</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">afforded by News International&#8217;s titles to Mr Cameron before the 2010 General Election,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there has been noticeably critical coverage in News International and other titles dating from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">around the same time.</span>
<h4>James Murdoch</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-33"><a href="#para3-33" name="para3-33">3.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">James Murdoch met the Prime Minister twice after the 2010 General Election. The first</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occasion was on 7 November 2010 when Mr Murdoch visited Chequers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref252" href="#footnote252">252</a></sup> The second</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occasion was a little over a month later, on 23 December 2010 at the home of Mr and Mrs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Brooks.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref253" href="#footnote253">253</a></sup> Both occasions took place whilst News Corp&#8217;s bid to acquire BskyB was current. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">second was two days after the sudden and dramatic events which had led to responsibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for considering the bid being transferred from Dr Cable to Mr Hunt. Mr Murdoch recalled a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dozen or fifteen people being present. He said the events of 21 December 2010 were briefly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">touched upon in conversation:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref254" href="#footnote254">254</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; there was no discussion with Mr Cameron other than as I&#8217;ve detailed in my witness</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">statement, which is simply he reiterated what he had said publicly, which is that the</span>

<a name="page1217"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">behaviour had been unacceptable, and I imagine I expressed a hope that things would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be dealt with in a way that was appropriate and judicial&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-34"><a href="#para3-34" name="para3-34">3.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron&#8217;s recollection was to the same effect. Having reminded the Inquiry that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had completely recused himself from the substantive decision about the bid, which is a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fundamental consideration, he said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref255" href="#footnote255">255</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, the gist was, as I explained, what Vince Cable had said, albeit privately but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">made publicly, was very embarrassing for the government, and I wanted to make</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">clear, I think appropriately, that this shouldn&#8217;t have happened, that it was wrong, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that this issue would now be dealt with entirely properly, and I thought that was quite</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an important point to make.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-35"><a href="#para3-35" name="para3-35">3.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The comment was perfectly in order. However, the fact that there was mention of the bid at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a private function and that it had not previously been made public caused speculation when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it emerged. Mr Cameron explained why Downing Street repeatedly declined to confirm the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fact of the supper on 23 December 2010:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref256" href="#footnote256">256</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think what would have happened here is that before we became totally transparent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about all these meetings, if Downing Street press office was asked about any social</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">engagement or private engagement they wouldn&#8217;t normally answer those questions,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and I think that&#8217;s what happened on this occasion. So they said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t comment</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the Prime Minister&#8217;s private or social engagements&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think the issue was pressed and in the end, I can&#8217;t remember if it was me or someone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">else, suggested, &#8220;Come on, there&#8217;s nothing to hide here, just answer the question&#8221;, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we&#8217;re now in a different world where all these sorts of meetings would be declared in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the normal way, but at that stage we weren&#8217;t routinely giving out private and social</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">engagements.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">After the 2010 General Election Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks continued to have a significant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">amount of both formal and informal contact. Politicians, like everyone else, are free to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">choose their friends, and to be friends with whomsoever they please. What is of interest to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry, and what has been investigated, is whether the contact has brought with it any</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressure or influence on the Coalition Government&#8217;s policies.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mrs Brooks hosted the dinner party on 23 December 2010, discussed above, at which there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was mention between James Murdoch and Mr Cameron of News Corp&#8217;s bid to acquire</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">BSkyB.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref261" href="#footnote261">261</a></sup> On 26 December 2010 both Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks were at a party hosted by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mrs Brooks&#8217; sister in law, although both Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks recalled little contact on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that occasion. Asked whether there was discussion of the BSkyB bid, Mr Cameron replied:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref262" href="#footnote262">262</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think there was. My memory is that Boxing Day was actually Charlie</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Brooks&#8217; sister&#8217;s house, there was a party, I think Rebekah was there briefly. I don&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think there was &#8211; certainly I don&#8217;t think there was a conversation about BSkyB. I&#8217;m</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not even sure there was much of a conversation at all, but that&#8217;s my recollection&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-40"><a href="#para3-40" name="para3-40">3.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mrs Brooks was similarly unsure whether there had been any conversation at all and was sure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the BskyB bid had not been mentioned:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref263" href="#footnote263">263</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. Yes, no, it&#8217;s &#8211; I&#8217;ve been asked about it before. Mr Cameron attended a Boxing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Day mulled wine, mince pie party at my sister-in-laws, and I popped in on my way</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to another dinner and I actually don&#8217;t have any memory, because I don&#8217;t think I did</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">even speak to him or Samantha that night, but my sister-in-law tells me they were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">definitely there for the party, so I would have seen them, but not even to have a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proper conversation.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Soastothescopeofanyconversation,whichyousaywasn&#8217;taproperconversation,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are you sure it would not have covered the BskyB issue?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Boxing Day.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Definitely. Absolutely not. I mean, I don&#8217;t think there was a conversation.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-41"><a href="#para3-41" name="para3-41">3.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Other Cabinet Ministers also maintained the connection with News International generally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Mrs Brooks in particular. The most frequent such contact was with Mr Osborne who had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">six meetings with Mrs Brooks after the election, two of which were at Dorneywood.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref264" href="#footnote264">264</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-42"><a href="#para3-42" name="para3-42">3.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Turning to specific issues, the Inquiry explored with both the Home Secretary, the Rt Hon</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Theresa May MP, and the Prime Minister what role Mrs Brooks and The Sun had played in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision for the Metropolitan Police to review the case of the disappearance of Madeleine</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">McCann. The review had the benefit of extra financial support from the Home Office and was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a subject of interest to a number of newspapers and their readers. The object of the review</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was to establish whether there were any other avenues of inquiry that should be pursued.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref265" href="#footnote265">265</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 11 May 2011, Mrs Brooks saw two of Mr Cameron&#8217;s SpAds about the review. Both she</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Mr Mohan also spoke to the Home Secretary about it by telephone. Mrs May was able</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to explain that the decision to have the Metropolitan Police review the case was, in fact, not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one which had been made suddenly:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref266" href="#footnote266">266</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;No, a review was not ordered &#8211; was not requested or required at short notice. The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Home Office had been discussing &#8211; first started discussing with ACPO the possibility of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a Police Review or further police work on this &#8211; they first started discussing with ACPO</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">under the previous government. So the discussion had been taking place for some</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">time &#8211; it took place with ACPO initially &#8211; for ACPO to identify which police force would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be appropriate to undertake the is work, if it was to be undertaken, and at the same</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">time there were discussions taking place with the Portuguese authorities, because</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of course, no UK police force can go into another country and start investigating;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they can only do so with the agreement, approval and assistance of the resident</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">authorities in that country.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-44"><a href="#para3-44" name="para3-44">3.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">She was clear that she had not been threatened with adverse coverage if she did not support</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the review by either Mrs Brooks or Mr Mohan. On the contrary, she had called them to tell</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them about developments:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> think</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> call</span><span style="font-style:italic"> at</span><span style="font-style:italic"> my</span><span style="font-style:italic"> instigation&#8221;.</span> The exchange with Counsel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Inquiry was as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref267" href="#footnote267">267</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Did Mrs Brooks say anything about &#8211; words to this effect: that unless you ordered</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the review, you would be on the front page of the Sun until that happened?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. No. Neither Mrs Brooks or Mr Mohan made any indication of that sort to me.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The nature of the telephone conversation was to alert them to the fact that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">government was taking some action, that there was going to be this further work by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the police here in the UK and to put forward the point that it was very important that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the UK authorities were able to work with the Portuguese authorities.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-45"><a href="#para3-45" name="para3-45">3.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Home Secretary did not feel that she had been pressured behind the scenes on the issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to take a position she would not otherwise have taken. Rather, she said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref268" href="#footnote268">268</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I felt that the work that we were doing to look at this review had been going on for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">some time, it was coming to a fruition around this time anyway, and obviously the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">issue was a matter of public concern.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-46"><a href="#para3-46" name="para3-46">3.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Prime Minister similarly had not felt pressured by Mrs Brooks, whether directly or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indirectly, to support and finance the review:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Pressure?</span><span style="font-style:italic"> No</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> wasn&#8217;t</span><span style="font-style:italic"> aware</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> any</span><span style="font-style:italic"> pressure&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref269" href="#footnote269">269</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He had checked and confirmed that the additional central government funding that was to be</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">provided to the Metropolitan Police was being properly deployed. When asked whether Mrs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Brooks&#8217; visit to his SpAds had been reported to him, he said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref270" href="#footnote270">270</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t recall. It might well have been. I don&#8217;t recall the exact conversations. I do</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recall, because I can see what might lie behind the question, which is: are you treating</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">different investigations and campaigns fairly? And I do remember actually, as Prime</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Minister, consulting the Permanent Secretary at Number 10 about the step that the</span>

<a name="page1220"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">police were about to take, backed by the government, which was to provide some</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">extra funding for the investigation, and it was drawn to my attention that there is a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">special Home Office procedure for helping with particularly complex and expensive</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigations that&#8217;s been used in various cases, and it was going to be used in this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">case and he was satisfied that that was &#8211; that had been dealt with properly and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">effectively. So it&#8217;s an example, if you lie, of the importance of making sure these things</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are done properly and I believe it was.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-47"><a href="#para3-47" name="para3-47">3.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When it came to the influence of newspaper campaigning on the issue, Mr Cameron had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rightly taken care to ask himself whether he was being confronted with self-interested media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressure or genuine public pressure:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref271" href="#footnote271">271</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, I mean clearly this was a very high-profile case, and a case that a number</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of newspapers wanted to champion because their readers wanted to champion it,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and obviously as government you have to think: are we helping with this because</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there&#8217;s media pressure or is it genuine public pressure, is there a genuine case, are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we treating this fairly? And I did ask those questions of the Permanent Secretary at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Number 10, and so I think we made an appropriate response. But I don&#8217;t remember</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any sort of specific pressure being put on me&#8230;&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span> .</span>

<p id="para-id-3-48"><a href="#para3-48" name="para3-48">3.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks did discuss the phone hacking story. Mrs Brooks recalled that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the period after the Guardian&#8217;s July 2009 story, they spoke about it in general terms</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;on occasion&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> once</span><span style="font-style:normal"> more</span><span style="font-style:normal"> specifically</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> late</span><span style="font-style:normal"> 2010</span><span style="font-style:normal"> when</span><span style="font-style:normal"> there</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> an</span><span style="font-style:normal"> increase</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of civil claims alleging phone hacking and seeking compensation. About the general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conversations, Mrs Brooks said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref272" href="#footnote272">272</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think on occasion &#8211; you know, not very often, so maybe once or twice, because of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the news and because, you know, the phone hacking story was a sort of a constant,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or it kept coming up. We would bring it up, but in the most general terms. Maybe in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2010, we had a more specific conversation about it, which I think is &#8211; yeah, that&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about right&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-49"><a href="#para3-49" name="para3-49">3.49</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the occasion of the more specific conversation, she could recall only in general terms what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron had asked:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref273" href="#footnote273">273</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think he asked me &#8211; I think it had been in the news that day &#8211; I think it was about</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">general update. I&#8217;m sorry, I can&#8217;t remember the date, but I just don&#8217;t have my records&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron had little recollection of the conversation but did not deny asking questions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the subject:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref275" href="#footnote275">275</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t really remember the specifics. I saw in her evidence that this was perhaps</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">something to do with me asking a question about some of these civil cases and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what was happening. I suspect it could have been that. This was an issue that was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">obviously being discussed. It was a controversial issue with all the civil cases and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rest of it, and I expect I could have asked some questions about that, but I don&#8217;t recall</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">the specifics&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the emerging story, recognising its sensitivity, but does not appear to have focused on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any detail. The indications are that he was provided with only general and publicly available</span>

<p id="para-id-3-53"><a href="#para3-53" name="para3-53">3.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When, on 15 July 2011, after the story had reached its height, Mrs Brooks resigned from her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">position as Chief Executive Officer of News International, she recalled receiving a message of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">support from Mr Cameron, albeit indirectly. The exchange with Counsel to the Inquiry on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subject was this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref276" href="#footnote276">276</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. It has been reported in relation to Mr Cameron &#8211; but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who knows whether it&#8217;s true &#8211; that you received a message along the lines of: &#8220;Keep</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">your head up.&#8221; Is that true or not?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A. From?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. From Mr Cameron, indirectly. You&#8217;ll have seen that in the Times.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes, I did see it in the Times. Along those lines. It was more &#8211; I don&#8217;t think they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were the exact words but along those lines.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Is the gist right, at least?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes, I would say so. But it was indirect. It wasn&#8217;t a direct text message.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Did you also receive a message from him via an intermediary along these lines:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Sorry I could not have been as loyal to you as I have been, but Ed Miliband had me on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the run.&#8221; Or words to that effect?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. Similar, but again, very indirectly.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. So, broadly speaking, that message was transmitted to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you, was it?</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A. Yes.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-54"><a href="#para3-54" name="para3-54">3.54</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It was but one of a number of messages of support or commiseration which she received</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from politicians, those working in their offices and others. The messages from politicians</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were all indirect and predominantly from Conservative rather than Labour politicians.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref277" href="#footnote277">277</a></sup> This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may have been more a reflection of News International&#8217;s support for the Conservatives and a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legacy of the company&#8217;s sudden move away from Labour in 2009 than anything else.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">As is well known, Mrs Brooks is currently facing criminal charges in connection with allegations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of wrongdoing at the NoTW, including in relation to phone hacking, perverting the course</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of justice and conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office. As is equally well known,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">she vehemently denies wrongdoing and has declared her intention of mounting a vigorous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">defence to all charges.</span>

<h3>Andy Coulson and the unfolding phone hacking scandal</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-56"><a href="#para3-56" name="para3-56">3.56</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Liberal Democrats had been highly critical of the appointment by Mr Cameron of Mr Coulson.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is therefore unsurprising that the question whether he should be appointed to the position</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Director of Government Communications was raised with Mr Cameron by the Deputy Prime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Minister, the Rt Hon Nick Clegg MP, in the early days of the coalition. Mr Clegg recalled asking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether it was the right thing to do although he stressed that neither he, nor Mr Cameron,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">knew then what is known now. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref278" href="#footnote278">278</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. Yes.Thatismyrecollection.Thebackgroundtoitis thatwe,theLiberalDemocrats,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my colleague, for instance, Chris Huhne, had been very outspoken in our criticisms of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">AndyCoulsonwhenhewasappointedtoworkfortheConservativePartyinopposition.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It&#8217;s self-evidently an issue. This was an individual who we had been highly critical of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and had been critical of his appointment before the election, so, you know, it would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have been very odd for us not to seek to straighten out our views now that we were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">suddenly and unexpectedly thrown together in government, as with so many issues.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I genuinely cannot remember the precise wording, but, you know, I said to the Prime</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Minister, I asked him, &#8220;Is this the right thing to do, given the controversy around Andy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Coulson?&#8221; given obviously the Prime Minister was aware of my party&#8217;s views on it.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Prime Minister explained the reasons that he&#8217;s given publicly why he felt that he&#8217;d</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been satisfied with the responses that he&#8217;d received from Andy Coulson and he felt, as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he&#8217;s put it, that he deserves a second chance.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Of course, a lot of the information and allegations we now know were not known</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to me or indeed the Prime Minister then. It&#8217;s quite important to remember that this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">conversation would have been quite different &#8211; we know now or think we know now</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that we didn&#8217;t know then.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">And also it is important to remember that in a coalition, the Prime Minister has a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">right to make choices about who he appoints to his team which I can&#8217;t and wouldn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ever seek to veto, in the same way that I am free to make appointments to my team</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which he can&#8217;t veto.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It was not a conversation which was based on the premise that somehow, you know,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I would say, &#8220;You can&#8217;t do that&#8221;, it&#8217;s just that wasn&#8217;t the understanding of it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-57"><a href="#para3-57" name="para3-57">3.57</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clegg was not the only person to raise the issue with Mr Cameron. The Prime Minister</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> handful</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> people&#8221;</span> having done so, including from within the Conservative</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Party:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref279" href="#footnote279">279</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Okay. Were similar concerns expressed to you directly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by anybody else, to the best of your recollection?</span>

<a name="page1223"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. There were &#8211; you know, some people did have concerns. I can&#8217;t remember exactly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who and when, but as I said, this was a controversial appointment. I&#8217;ve read in some</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of these books about a number of people who have made these points, but I don&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recall many specifics, but clearly some people did have concerns, yes.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. And were they concerns expressed from within your own party?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I think there might have been one or two, I think there might have been a specific</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">MP, I think Andrew Tyrie. That&#8217;s not something I recall directly but something that has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been pointed out to me, but he may have expressed concerns to me, but ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. In terms of quantity, approximately how many people fall into this group of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expressing concerns to you?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I couldn&#8217;t put a number on it, but not &#8211; you know, a handful of people, I think it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would be.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-58"><a href="#para3-58" name="para3-58">3.58</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Ashdown cautioned Ed Llewellyn, whom he knew well, to the effect that the appointment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was a decision which the Prime Minister might well come to regret; but he did not have any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">new specific information about him. Mr Llewellyn saw no need to pass on Lord Ashdown&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opinion (for an opinion is all that it was) to Mr Cameron at the time, although he did so in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">summer of 2011 when the hacking scandal peaked. The point was not new and Mr Llewellyn</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">must have been well aware that Mr Cameron fully understood the position and his decision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was perfectly reasonable.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref280" href="#footnote280">280</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-59"><a href="#para3-59" name="para3-59">3.59</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Contrary to some assertions that concerns were raised by a wide range of different people,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord O&#8217;Donnell did not receive any complaints about Mr Coulson as he made clear in his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref281" href="#footnote281">281</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Neither the Deputy Prime Minister nor the royal household raised any concerns with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">me or officials either before or during Mr Coulson&#8217;s period of employment as a special</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">adviser. I have to admit to being somewhat surprised to be asked about Buckingham</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Palace when they have already clearly said on no occasion did any officials from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Buckingham Palace raise concerns to Downing Street and indeed it is outrageous to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">suggest this. Neither were any concerns raised with my by the Prime Minister or any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other special advisers about Mr Coulson&#8217;s conduct in previous employment.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The question of Mr Coulson&#8217;s security clearance in Government is an issue which aroused</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">much public comment. When recruited by the Conservative Party, Mr Coulson was the subject</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">publicly available information.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref282" href="#footnote282">282</a></sup> In Government he was vetted to a level known as SC, Security</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Clearance. He was not vetted to a higher level known as DV, Developed Vetting, although he</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">was in the course of the lengthy process of being assessed for this level of clearance at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">time of his resignation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref283" href="#footnote283">283</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The level of security clearance was not the decision of either Mr Cameron or Mr Coulson</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but the Civil Service.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref284" href="#footnote284">284</a></sup> SC is appropriate for long term, frequent access to secret material,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or occasional/controlled access to top secret material. DV vetting is exceptional, conducted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only where there is a &#8220;business need&#8221; and is required solely for those who have long-term,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">frequent/uncontrolled access to top secret material.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref285" href="#footnote285">285</a></sup> Lord O&#8217;Donnell made clear that it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not uncommon for people in Mr Coulson&#8217;s position to start work without DV clearance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but then come to require it. So far as Mr Coulson was concerned, he explained that a need</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for more frequent access to top secret material than SC clearance permitted had became</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apparent as a result of issues and stories concerning terrorism. He put it this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref286" href="#footnote286">286</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It quite often turned out that they would start off with that view &#8211; or, in this case,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Number 10 permanent secretary would have that view &#8211; and then, as events</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">changed, they would realise &#8211; the first big terrorist event came along and then there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would be a lot of papers which, by their nature, were all top secret, and then you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would say, &#8220;Actually, this isn&#8217;t working, we need to give access to this&#8221;, or: &#8220;It would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have been better if that person had access to these papers routinely, therefore we&#8217;ve</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decided ...&#8221;. And this is what happened with Mr Coulson: we decided in the light of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">terrorist incident, the airline bomb plot, that actually it made for sense for him to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">DV&#8217;d so we could give him regular access to these papers.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Up to then, it hadn&#8217;t been an issue because I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;d been that interested in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">those aspects of work which would have required them to have top secret access.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Information concerning the recent Directors of Communication and Prime Minister&#8217;s Official</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Spokesmen showed that, of six post holders, three had DV clearance when they took up their</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In any event, the process of considering Mr Coulson for DV status would not have involved a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">detailed investigation of phone hacking at the NoTW; rather it is directed at whether he was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at risk of blackmail. Lord O&#8217;Donnell said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref288" href="#footnote288">288</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think some people have different understandings of what DV&#8217;ing would reveal. It</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wouldn&#8217;t have gone into enormous detail about phone hacking, for example.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: No. It&#8217;s concerned with whether you&#8217;re likely to be a risk.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">A. Whether you&#8217;re blackmailable, basically, yes, absolutely, and in terms of your</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">financial position or your personal life.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Upon his appointment as Director of Government Communications, Mr Coulson was required</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to declare any conflicts of interest. He still owned some shares in News Corp at that time. Their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gross value by the time he gave evidence was around &#163;40,000.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref289" href="#footnote289">289</a></sup> Lord O&#8217;Donnell confirmed</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to excuse his failure to do so. He first raised the point in his witness statement:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref291" href="#footnote291">291</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Whilst I didn&#8217;t consider my holding of this stock to represent any kind of conflict</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of interest, in retrospect I wish I had paid more attention to it. I was never asked</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about any share or stock holdings and because I knew that I wasn&#8217;t involved in any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">commercial issues, including the BskyB bid, it never occurred to me that there could</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be a conflict of interest&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Later, he said in evidence:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref292" href="#footnote292">292</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;This is by way of explanation, not excuse. My job in opposition was a busy one. My</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">job in government was busier still, and I didn&#8217;t take the time to pay close attention to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my own circumstances in this regard, and I should have done.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-65"><a href="#para3-65" name="para3-65">3.65</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Significantly for the purposes of the Inquiry, Mr Coulson did not discuss the existence of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his shareholding in News Corp with anybody in the Conservative Party or in the Coalition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government. There is no evidence that anyone else knew about it therefore, or ought to have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">asked about it.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref293" href="#footnote293">293</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Questions as to the wisdom of the appointment of Mr Coulson did not go away. When the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">New York Times published the article of 1 September 2010 which, amongst other things,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">directly accused Mr Coulson of encouraging or knowledge of phone hacking, Mr Coulson</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issued an immediate denial.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref294" href="#footnote294">294</a></sup> Mr Cameron was made aware of the article but was prepared</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to rely on Mr Cameron&#8217;s denial:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref295" href="#footnote295">295</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t recall exactly the conversations that took place. It was on the day I moved</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">into Number 10 Downing Street after the birth of our daughter, so that&#8217;s the memory</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I have from that day rather than anything around this, but I&#8217;m absolutely clear he</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">made an outright denial and that was that&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-67"><a href="#para3-67" name="para3-67">3.67</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the same month DAC John Yates reacted by offering to brief the Prime Minister on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">response of the Metropolitan Police Service to the article in the New York Times. The offer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was declined by Mr Llewellyn who made the Prime Minister aware of the approach.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref296" href="#footnote296">296</a></sup> Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cameron explained why Mr Llewellyn was right to decline the briefing, a decision which he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said DAC Yates has since accepted was proper and understandable:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref297" href="#footnote297">297</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. But so we understand it, why was it not appropriate?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Well, I think because there was the potential of an investigation following this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">allegation in the New York Times article, I think in terms of just the perception that</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was understandable and sensible, I think he said, and Gus O&#8217;Donnell, the Cabinet</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 24 February 2010, before the election, the Guardian published an article alleging that,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">while Mr Coulson was the editor, the NoTW had<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;employed</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> freelance</span><span style="font-style:italic"> private</span><span style="font-style:italic"> investigator</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigator concerned, for legal reasons, it was a reference to Jonathan Rees who was then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the subject of further criminal proceedings. Ian Katz discussed the issue first with Steve</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Hilton in February 2010 and then with Mr Llewellyn in October 2010. The information was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not passed to Mr Cameron. He explained why to the House of Commons on 13 July 2011,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence which he repeated to the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref299" href="#footnote299">299</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;First, this information was not passed on to me, but let me be clear that this was not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">some secret stash of information; almost all of it was published in The Guardian in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">February 2010, at the same time my office was approached.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It contained no allegations directly linking Andy Coulson to illegal behaviour and it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">did not shed any further light on the issue of phone hacking, so it was not drawn to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my attention by my office&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-69"><a href="#para3-69" name="para3-69">3.69</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The editor of the Guardian did not raise the issue with Mr Cameron at meetings both in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">month after the article was published and the following year.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref300" href="#footnote300">300</a></sup> Mr Cameron first became</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aware that Jonathan Rees had been employed by the NoTW on Mr Coulson&#8217;s watch when the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Guardian published a further more explicit story on 12 March 2011, seven weeks after Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Coulson&#8217;s resignation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref301" href="#footnote301">301</a></sup> In those circumstances there can be no criticism of Mr Cameron for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not raising the issue with Mr Coulson or taking action arising from it.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-70"><a href="#para3-70" name="para3-70">3.70</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Matters eventually got to a point where, on 21 January 2011, Mr Coulson resigned. From his</span>

<a name="page1227"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I had a number of conversations with him about his impending resignation and what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">followed from the New York Times article, which I know you&#8217;ve looked at, is the police</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">then had an initial look to see if they should investigate again and said they shouldn&#8217;t,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">then they had another look and again concluded that they shouldn&#8217;t, and then the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Crown Prosecution Service on 10 December said they weren&#8217;t going to take it any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">further. So again, these weren&#8217;t just assurances accepted by me, as it were, there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were others that took this view.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Then, really, this was the start of the process whereby Andy Coulson was becoming</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">clear that, as he put it, when the spokesman needs a spokesman, it&#8217;s time to move</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on. He was finding his job was impossible to do because of all these stories and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rest of it, and obviously I had a number of discussions with him about his departure.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-71"><a href="#para3-71" name="para3-71">3.71</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DuringtheeightmonthsinwhichMrCoulsonwastheDirectorofGovernmentCommunications,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he had very regular contact with the Prime Minister. His evidence gave a good insight into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron&#8217;s media operation. There were usually two meetings each day at which he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would see the Prime Minister, one in the morning between 08:30 and 09:00hrs and the other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the afternoon at 16:00hrs. Mr Coulson provided a brief media summary as part of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">morning meeting. The afternoon meeting involved an update and a look ahead. Mr Coulson</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">corroborated the Prime Minister&#8217;s evidence that Mr Cameron made a conscious decision to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reduce his personal contact with the media after becoming Prime Minister so that he could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concentrate on Government. Cabinet Ministers, Mr Coulson stated, were encouraged to do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more. He described the approach as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref303" href="#footnote303">303</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;One of the biggest changes of approach from opposition to government with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regard to communication and the media was the decision to reduce the amount of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">appearances by the PM. Cabinet members were encouraged to do more. We felt that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Gordon Brown&#8217;s habit of providing an almost constant commentary of interviews was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the wrong approach and that David Cameron would aim to be less obsessed by day to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">day media demands. This had the benefit of creating more time for the real work of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Government. It also created the impression and more important a reality, of a calmer,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more professional Government.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">This was demonstrated by the fact that on arrival in No10, David Cameron also opted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to swap Gordon Brown&#8217;s private office, which resembled a newspaper newsroom</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">complete with giant plasma screens showing 24 hour news channels, for the smaller</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">office next to the Cabinet Room&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-72"><a href="#para3-72" name="para3-72">3.72</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In Government Mr Coulson continued his policy of meeting media proprietors, executives and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seeking to cultivate and maintain a wide and deep range of contacts. This included contact</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">with former News International colleagues, both formal and informal in nature. He stayed at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dorneywood with Mr and Mrs Osborne, and with Mr and Mrs Brooks, in 2010. Having worked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">together, Mr Coulson and Mr Osborne had become friends.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref304" href="#footnote304">304</a></sup> Mr Coulson later spent the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I just make one other point, which is &#8211; because I recognise this is a controversial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">appointment, this has come back to haunt both him and me and I&#8217;ve said what I&#8217;ve</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">said about 20/20 hindsight, but in doing the job as Director of Communications for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Conservative Party, and then Director of Communications in Downing Street, he</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">did the job very effectively. There weren&#8217;t any complaints about how he conducted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">himself. He ran a very effective team. He behaved in a very proper way.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Of course, if that wasn&#8217;t the case, then I think people would have an even stronger</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">argument of saying, &#8220;Well, you took a risk, you employed this person and look what&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">happened.&#8221; He did his job very well, and I think that is an important point to make.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-75"><a href="#para3-75" name="para3-75">3.75</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Osborne, like Mr Cameron, has expressed regret at the appointment with hindsight. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stated:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref310" href="#footnote310">310</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I said on 25th July 2011 that &#8220;knowing what we know now, we regret the decision</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and I suspect that Andy Coulson would not have taken the job knowing what he</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">knows now. But we did not have 20/20 hindsight when we made that decision.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I hold this view because of the evidence that has since come to light about what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">happened at the News of the World that had not been uncovered by the original</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">police investigation. I did not speak to Mr Coulson before making this statement, or</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Matters came to a head in July 2011 when a full blown media storm erupted. It began on 4</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">profound public outrage. Mr Clegg put it this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref316" href="#footnote316">316</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A strong, free, diverse press is the lifeblood of a democratic society. Yet the evidence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of widespread phone hacking at The News of the World, culminating in the revelation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that Milly Dowler&#8217;s phone had been hacked, led to widespread and justified public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">revulsion.Inaveryvividway,illegalnewsroompracticeswereshowntohaveimpacted</span>

<p id="para-id-3-79"><a href="#para3-79" name="para3-79">3.79</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Events continued to move quickly after that. On 7 July 2011 James Murdoch announced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the closure of the NoTW which was being abandoned by advertisers. On 8 July 2011, Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cameron announced that there would be a judge-led inquiry to investigate phone hacking at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the NoTW and a second inquiry to look at the ethics and culture of the press. He described</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the moment as &#8220;carthartic&#8221; for both the press and politicians, a term to which he returned in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his evidence:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref317" href="#footnote317">317</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We&#8217;re here because of the truly dreadful things that happened not to politicians but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to ordinary members of the public whose lives had been turned upside down when</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they&#8217;ve already suffered through losing their children, and had their lives turned</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">upside down in a totally unacceptable way and this is, I think, a cathartic moment</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">where press, politicians, police, all the relationships that haven&#8217;t been right, we have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a chance to reset them and that is what we must do.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cameron&#8217;s aides. On 9 July 2011, DAC Yates expressed his &#8220;extreme regret&#8221; at not reopening</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In my view, it is important that politicians rise to the challenge to do the right thing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for the country. A free and fearless press is an essential part of our democratic process</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and politicians must act to maintain this wider principle. The opportunity is for this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Inquiry to produce recommendations that all political parties can get behind and get</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the balance of regulation right. That is why when I set up this Inquiry I agreed the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Terms of Reference with the leaders of the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties.&#8221;</span>

<a name="section4"></a>
<h2>4. Reflections</h2>

<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Cameron has worked closely with the media throughout his careers in politics and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">television. His experiences of the relationship between the press and the politicians in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1990s and early 2000s before becoming Leader of the Opposition were evidently formative.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both in Opposition and in Government, his declared strategy has been to engage with a very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wide range of broadcast and print media and to do so in depth, formally and informally.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He felt it necessary to make considerable efforts and to allocate a good deal of his time,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">especially in Opposition, to his media strategy. The scale of his disclosed contacts with media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">figures amply demonstrate that this was so. As Prime Minister, he took deliberate steps to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reducehispersonalcontactwiththemediabut,atadifferentlevel,theapproachofmaintaining</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wide and deep contacts with the media remained and was continued in Government.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The demands made of politicians both by the 24 hour news cycle and the increasing tendency</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to &#8220;high volume&#8221; newspaper coverage of events have become greater than ever during Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cameron&#8217;s time at the top level in politics. Those demands are felt in concentrated form by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">directors of communication for political parties and, especially, by the Director of Government</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Communication.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne have, with hindsight, expressed regret at their decision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to appoint Mr Coulson to that post. Mr Coulson&#8217;s own assurances played an important part</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in that decision. He continues to stand by them. For obvious reasons concerned with the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal investigations and prosecutions (both in England and Scotland), I have not asked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any questions directed to the issue of what, if anything, Mr Coulson did know and when or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether the assurances that he has given are accurate. These are for another time. None of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, however, means that I cannot address the Terms of Reference.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The results of Mr Cameron&#8217;s media strategy in Opposition were successful in winning</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the support of the centre right press and the endorsement of News International. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstances in which Rupert Murdoch and his close advisers decided to endorse Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cameron are complex. Mr Cameron went to great lengths to secure meetings face-to-face</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Mr Murdoch and other News International executives and editors. The benefits of this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may have played some part in the outcome but should not be overestimated. As Mr Osborne</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fairly observed, the Conservatives were not the only politicians dining with the Murdochs and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their executives.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref321" href="#footnote321">321</a></sup> There were many factors other than personal contact.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence does not, of course, establish anything resembling a &#8216;deal&#8217; whereby News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">International&#8217;s support was traded for the expectation of policy favours. All of those involved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strenuously deny that there was a deal whether express or implied. The documents do not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gainsay them. Nor do the Coalition Government&#8217;s actions in Government.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-7"><a href="#para4-7" name="para4-7">4.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nevertheless, Mr Cameron frankly and, in my view, properly accepts that politicians have got</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">too close to the media. In his words:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref322" href="#footnote322">322</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Yes. I mean, that&#8217;s part of my evidence, really, is to say I think this relationship</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">has been going wrong for, you know &#8211; it&#8217;s never been perfect. There have always</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been problems and you can point to examples of Churchill putting Beaverbrook as a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">minister. There have been issues for years.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">But I think in the last 20 years, I think the relationship has not been right. I think it has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been too close, as I explain in my evidence, and I think we need to try and get it on a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">better footing.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-8"><a href="#para4-8" name="para4-8">4.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The problem is public perception. This section of the Report has dealt with too many issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where the public, not knowing any more than it has (or, I might say, than what it reads in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers), has been entitled to worry about the way things have been done and what has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been going on. A way of conducting relationships with the media which leads to a situation in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which a public Inquiry is needed to take an objective, not to say forensic, look at the matter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in order to reassure the public cannot be considered as satisfactory or itself in the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-9"><a href="#para4-9" name="para4-9">4.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although it manifests itself in different ways, the problem is not unique to any individual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politician or any one political party. It has affected previous administrations, both in office</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and whilst seeking power. As Mr Cameron has agreed, change is needed, and that means that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political leaders need to show leadership in making that change. That is also my concluded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view. I consider in the Conclusions and Recommendations section of this Part of the Report</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what, in my view, would support political leaders in making that change.</span>
