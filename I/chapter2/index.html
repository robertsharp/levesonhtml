<h1>CHAPTER 2<br/>THE CONSERVATIVE YEARS</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Prime Minister thatcher: 1979-1990</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Margaret, now Baroness, Thatcher enjoyed sustained, substantial though not unqualified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">support from a range of national newspaper titles throughout her tenure as Prime Minister,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">yet she is reputed to have spent little time herself actually reading newspapers:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Margaret Thatcher never read a newspaper from one week to the next.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">While titles with a consistent history of leaning to the left of centre were equally consistently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">critical, those sections of the press with a history of shifting political leanings were as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">supportive as traditionally Conservative newspapers. In that sense, at any rate, from Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mandelson&#8217;s perspective:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Mrs Thatcher was able to call on the virtually uncritical support of both publishers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">and editors.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A particular feature of Baroness Thatcher&#8217;s era was the strong personal relationship which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">she enjoyed with a number of newspaper proprietors, characterised by mutual respect and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">shared political ideology. Rupert Murdoch described himself to be a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> great</span><span style="font-style:italic"> admirer&#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Baroness Thatcher, agreeing that he was on the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> same</span><span style="font-style:italic"> page</span><span style="font-style:italic"> politically</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry heard a consistency of opinion on this matter. Mr Murdoch&#8217;s title, The Sun,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was described to the Inquiry by Tony Blair as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> major</span><span style="font-style:italic"> part</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> supporting</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Mrs</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Thatcher&#8221;,</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although Mr Murdoch himself put it more modestly.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> David Mellor QC observed that:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> [Rupert</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Murdoch&#8217;s]</span><span style="font-style:italic"> ...straightforward</span><span style="font-style:italic"> right</span><span style="font-style:italic"> wing</span><span style="font-style:italic"> populist</span><span style="font-style:italic"> opinions</span><span style="font-style:italic"> made</span><span style="font-style:italic"> him</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> soulmate</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for Mrs Thatcher&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Sir</span><span style="font-style:normal"> John</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Major</span><span style="font-style:normal"> attributed</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Baroness</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Thatcher&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:normal"> rapport</span><span style="font-style:normal"> with</span><span style="font-style:normal"> newspaper</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proprietors to her political outlook:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Margaret was probably the most right of centre leader the Conservative Party had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had for quite a long time, and I think that appealed to the natural instincts of many</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proprietors and editors at the time, and I think support was accordingly offered.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Andrew Neil, the former editor of The Sunday Times, also described Baroness Thatcher and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Murdoch as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> ideological</span><span style="font-style:italic"> soul</span><span style="font-style:italic"> mates&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> Sir John interestingly connected the bond between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Baroness Thatcher and these proprietors with their common commitment to trade union</span>










 <span style="font-size: 15px;">reform, to shared views about business (and buccaneering businessmen)<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> and the European</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Union, and to popular admiration for Baroness Thatcher&#8217;s role in the Falklands War.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Baroness Thatcher&#8217;s relationship with many proprietors did not manifest itself in frequent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meetings with them or their editors. Mr Murdoch firmly denied the suggestion that he had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consulted with her regularly on every important matter of policy.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup> Mr Neil saw Baroness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thatcher once in seven years.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup> Kelvin MacKenzie told the Inquiry that he probably saw</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Baroness Thatcher about twice a year but later confirmed that he did not doubt that she</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wanted his support.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The relatively modest number of meetings does not necessarily indicate that a friendly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proprietor did not have access to the Prime Minister. Mr Murdoch was readily received when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he approached herwhilst hewas a bidder for Times Newspapers. The result was thathe visited</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chequers for lunch where he briefed her on his bid and his vision for Times Newspapers. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acquisition of Times Newspapers is described in detail elsewhere.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is easy to understand why Baroness Thatcher enjoyed a good relationship with a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of proprietors but more difficult to attribute any specific benefit for either party to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship itself. Baroness Thatcher enjoyed a good deal of positive media coverage,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although even generally supportive titles were sometimes critical (for example, Mr Murdoch</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">preferred to support President Reagan over Baroness Thatcher when the United States</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">invaded Grenada).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup> But the explanation for the positive coverage is readily attributable to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editorial approval for her policies and disapproval of those of the Opposition. There was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">straightforward political alignment and an element of straightforward mutual personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rapport (not to say admiration).</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Importantly, it is clear from Mr Murdoch&#8217;s evidence, which is corroborated by contemporary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">notes, that he neither expressly asked for nor was expressly offered any favourable policy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decisions by Baroness Thatcher.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup> He was indeed permitted to buy Times Newspapers without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) but this does not appear to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">me to be directly attributable to personal influence. The Prime Minister was not in any event</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the decision maker.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Neil suggested that in late 1985, in the run up to the major industrial dispute at Wapping,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Murdochwentto&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> squareThatcher</span> &#8221;,bywhichhemeantseekanassurancethattherewould</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be sufficient policing of the dispute to enable him to continue to do business at Wapping.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That was indeed the result, but the Government&#8217;s stance during the Wapping dispute was in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accordance with its approach to other industrial disputes (not least the miners&#8217; strike).</span>










 <p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An indication of the influence of Mr Murdoch towards the end of Baroness Thatcher&#8217;s tenure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was provided by Mr Mellor in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;By the time Murdoch came to establish Sky, a brave entrepreneurial investment that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deserved to succeed, and a process I was happy to help along in the Broadcasting Act</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">1990, he was used to Ministers doing his bidding, rather than the other way around.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He was personally charming to deal with, but he was one of the few people, apart</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from Heads of State, I, as a minister, had to visit at his premises rather than him</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">having to schlepp over to the Home Office.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-10"><a href="#para1-10" name="para1-10">1.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There were nevertheless decisions on media policy taken by the Government which went</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">against supportive proprietors. News International was not granted a domestic broadcasting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">licence and had to launch Sky, its satellite television service, using a foreign satellite.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup> On</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this, the Sunday Times, under Mr Neil, supported Lord Heseltine against Baroness Thatcher.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-11"><a href="#para1-11" name="para1-11">1.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">More than one witness suggested that the prospect of honours played a part in Baroness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thatcher&#8217;s relationship with senior media figures. Alastair Campbell put it bluntly:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Margaret Thatcher had much more press support, partly for political and ideological</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reasons, in that most owners and editors are right wing and genuinely supported</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">her, but also because she operated what today would be seen as a corrupt system of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">patronage using the honours system to reward supportive owners and editors&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-12"><a href="#para1-12" name="para1-12">1.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Mandelson did not put it so high:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;She cultivated and honoured and nurtured editors and journalists very successfully.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The relationship was, I think, relatively calm during her period. It might not have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">seemed so calm to her on all occasions ...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-13"><a href="#para1-13" name="para1-13">1.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Grade offered these thoughts on the question of patronage:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...we are happily past the days when the politicians of the day used to pack the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">boards of the regulators with their friends and supporters, such as my time as a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">controller of BBC One when in the days of then Mrs Thatcher&#8217;s government when the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">board of the BBC were packed with her friends. We&#8217;ve moved on from then, we have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">a Nolan process ...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-14"><a href="#para1-14" name="para1-14">1.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An issue of interest to the Inquiry was the question of the perception amongst politicians of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the extent to which newspaper endorsement assists election prospects. Andrew Marr said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There is always a hierarchy of media contacts. For a Conservative minister, contacts</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at The Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, The Spectator and blogs like Conservative home</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are particularly valuable, and likely to be closer; Liberal Democrats will more likely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">turn to papers and blogs read by their activists, and Labour, ditto. Throughout the</span>







 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Thatcher, Major and Blair governments, the Murdoch stable was always perceived by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">its rivals to have a privileged position.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;This was because of its spread and power as a publishing group, and Mr Murdoch&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">readiness to use papers such as the Sun to intervene aggressively. But it made close</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">social relationships, at Murdoch parties or Oxfordshire get-togethers, peculiarly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">disheartening for press rivals&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<p id="para-id-1-15"><a href="#para1-15" name="para1-15">1.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As notable as the active support of much of the press for Baroness Thatcher was its hostile</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attitude to the Opposition. Throughout Baroness Thatcher&#8217;s time in office, successive Leaders</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Opposition, first Michael Foot and then Neil Kinnock, were the subject of considerable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adverse press coverage. Writing from the Labour Party&#8217;s perspective, Mr Campbell described</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the period as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;What we do know is that the press [Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock] received was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hugely biased against them, and in favour of Mrs Thatcher and her Party. Michael</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Foot had long been derided by the right wing media for perceived political and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">personal shortcomings, the most famous being the alleged disrespect he showed in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">attending the 1981 Remembrance Sunday Service in what was mythologised as a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;donkey jacket&#8221;. But that was but part of a long campaign during which in several</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">papers Mr Foot could only be defined negatively. According to the book, Stick it up</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">your Punter, the Sun and the Express told freelance photographers covering a Foot</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">visit not to bother sending pictures of the Labour leader &#8220;unless falling over, shot or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">talking to Militants.&#8221; The Daily Mail, under a pre-knighted David English, led a front</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">page with a disputed claim that Nissan would &#8220;scrap plans for a &#163;50m car plant&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">if Labour won the election. &#8220;35,000 jobs lost if Foot wins&#8221; screamed the headline.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I cite this as a typical rather than exceptional example. Labour&#8217;s defeat in 1979, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a seeming shift to the left, ignited not so much political debate as focus on sinister</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Marxist forces, wrongly ensuring that at times in the public debate Labour&#8217;s political</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">doctrine was indistinguishable from the Communists&#8217;. The Express earned top marks</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from Tory Central Office with a &#8220;Spot the Trots&#8221; feature of 70 &#8220;extremist&#8221; candidates,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">among them Neil Kinnock and Robin Cook&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-16"><a href="#para1-16" name="para1-16">1.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Mandelson put it this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think what I meant by [horrible and bloody] is that, you know, there has been a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">longer standing trend in the press to mix reporting with comment, and it didn&#8217;t simply</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">revolve around that period in the 1980s and the 1992 election. I think that what took</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this sort of merging of comment and reporting to a higher level was the more lethal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cocktail, which I believe that the Labour Party was exposed to, and that was a sort of</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mixture of aggression and inaccuracy, and I think that the Labour Party generally and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">its leader, Mr Kinnock, in particular were the victims of that.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think that the press took their gloves off, I think there was a sort of lack of scruple</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or restraint in the reporting of the Labour Party in those years.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Now I also quite honestly observe in my witness statement that, you know, a lot of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the damage the Labour Party had done to itself in the early part of the 1980s. We</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">weren&#8217;t exactly making it easy for people to report us positively or warmly given the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">vote-losing policies, the divisions, the entries into the Labour Party by the far left.</span>


 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;But by the end of the 1980s, by the time we got to the 1992 General Election, a great</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deal, I would say the bulk of that swamp had been emptied, and that the Labour</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Party had changed and I don&#8217;t think we were given the credit for those changes and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think Mr Kinnock in particular was on the receiving end of treatment by the media,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">notably but not only News International titles, that was not warranted and was not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">fair&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-17"><a href="#para1-17" name="para1-17">1.17</a></p>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that time. He didn&#8217;t get a fair crack of the whip, and therefore if he tried to sell a policy,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it tended to get misrepresented<span style="font-style:normal"> .&#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Headlines</span><span style="font-style:normal"> from</span><span style="font-style:normal"> this</span><span style="font-style:normal"> era</span><span style="font-style:normal"> included:</span><span style="font-style:normal"> &#8220;</span> Glenys the Menace<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The relationship between the Labour Party and News International was particularly poor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">during this period for another reason: the dispute at Wapping. Labour sought to mark its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disapproval of Mr Murdoch&#8217;s handling of the dispute by cutting off the supply of political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">news to his reporters. As Andrew Grice, formerly the political editor of the Sunday Times,</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">put it:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There was a major industrial dispute at Wapping in 1986/7. During that period,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">officially at least, the Labour party was not even talking to the Murdoch papers and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Murdoch paper journalists were banned from any briefings or press conferences the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Labour party held. So the back cloth was not just difficult relations but no official</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relationships at all&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-19"><a href="#para1-19" name="para1-19">1.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Campbell said that after the Wapping dispute the Labour Party wanted nothing to do with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Murdoch papers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-20"><a href="#para1-20" name="para1-20">1.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A similarly confrontational line was also taken by the Labour Party with TV AM when it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involved in an industrial dispute. Adam Boulton explained to the Inquiry how he was unable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to take cameras with him into the Labour Party conference:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...I report that in the context of having been through the TV AM dispute when, at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the urging of the ACTT, the Labour Party had done precisely that. They had blacked,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as it was then called, TV AM so we could not take our cameras, for example, into the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Labour Party Conference of that year so that we &#8211; their spokesmen would not appear</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on our programmes. And of course, the immediate effect of that is that it means that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">your offering is weaker than the offering of your competitors, who have full access to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">all the political parties&#8221;.</span>

<h2>2. Prime Minister Major: 1990-1997</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In November 1990 Sir John Major took up office with what he himself described as a quixotic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approachtothenationalpress.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup> Hewaskeentowintheirsupportandcloselyfollowedpolitical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">coverage. But he did not seek a close relationship with proprietors and editors. Instead, he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">kept his distance, leaving contact primarily to others, especially his Press Secretary, a post</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">held throughout his tenure by a civil servant.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir John fared well, initially, so far as newspaper coverage was concerned. The 1992 election</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was marked by fiercely hostile coverage towards Sir John&#8217;s political rival Lord Kinnock.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, it was not long before sections of the press turned their hostility towards him.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By the time of the 1997 election, The Sun and The News of the World had unequivocally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transferred their support to New Labour.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Major years are undoubtedly important for the work of the Inquiry in relation to media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">policybecauseitfelltoSirJohn&#8217;sGovernmenttoconsiderandrespondtotherecommendations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Sir David Calcutt QC&#8217;s reports.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup> Many, including Sir John and Mr Cameron, now consider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the response of the time amounted to a missed opportunity.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As Prime Minister, Sir John made a conscious choice not to seek a close relationship with any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">part of the media. He did not think it appropriate and, in any event, he did not share a closely-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aligned political ideology or personal affinity with any of the media proprietors of the time.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his own words:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;As Prime Minister, I did not inherit &#8211; or seek &#8211; a close relationship with any part of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the media. I did not go out of my way to engage with the press. This was my own</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">choice, made in part by natural instinct, and in part because the Black and Murdoch</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press were wedded to a more ideological type of Conservatism than my own. Nor</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">did I engage closely with the Maxwell press or other centre or centrist left titles. This</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decision was, to an extent, quixotic, since the press are a daily route to the electorate.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Nonetheless, a close engagement did not feel comfortable or proper to me and I left</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relationships with the media largely to the No 10 Press Office &#8211; then staffed exclusively</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by civil servants &#8211; and, where appropriate, the Party machine...I did not offer any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">peerages or knighthoods to any national newspaper proprietors or editors ...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir John explained to the Inquiry his view that in terms of democratic accountability, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">best relationship between the media and senior politicians is one of &#8216;constructive tension&#8217;. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be neither too friendly nor too oppositional. In particular, if the relationship becomes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">too close it can become the context for exchanges of self-interest: leaks and stories in return</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">for favourable coverage, as Sir John told the Inquiry had happened to an unnamed politician</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">during the passage of the Maastricht Bill.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In practice, Sir John did not often meet national newspaper proprietors. He met Mr Murdoch</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on three occasions (in 1992, 1993 and 1997 respectively), Lord (Conrad) Black on seven</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occasions and Lord Stevens twice (and attended four social events at his invitation). He did</span>




 <span style="font-size: 15px;">not meet Robert Maxwell at all, although Mr Maxwell did on occasion telephone No 10.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Strikingly, he not only turned down an invitation from Mr Murdoch in August 1993 to attend</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a &#8220;special celebration&#8221; to mark the launch of new Sky TV channels but also discouraged other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cabinet members from attending.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref38" href="#footnote38">38</a></sup> He met editors and political editors occasionally, typically</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the presence of his Press Secretary, and usually for the purposes of explaining a particular</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">policy.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref39" href="#footnote39">39</a></sup> He could recall hosting only one press lunch at Chequers, on 3 December 1995.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Unlike his immediate predecessor, he did not confer any peerages or honours on national</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper proprietors and editors (although the position was different in relation to regional</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and magazine editors).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The difference of approach was put into this context by Mr Campbell:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;You see, I think a lot of this started under Margaret Thatcher, because I think that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapers were given a sense of power. The numbers that received the peerages</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the knighthoods and the sense that they were almost part of her team. I think it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">changed under John Major, and then I think when we were in power, I think that we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; I think we maybe did give the media too much of a sense of their own place within</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the political firmament when we should have challenged it more&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord O&#8217;Donnell (as he now is), a career civil servant, served as Sir John&#8217;s Press Secretary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between 1990 and 1994 before being succeeded by another civil servant, Sir Christopher</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Meyer. Lord O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s brief was to present Government policy on an even-handed basis to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all members of the media. This approach marked a change from the higher profile approach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of his predecessor, Sir Bernard Ingham, and was associated with the return of the Guardian</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and The Independent to the lobby. In Lord O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s own words:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, I was told by the then cabinet secretary, Robin Butler, that what he wanted me</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to do in the role as press secretary was to lower the profile of the press secretary &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as you mentioned, Mr Ingham, now Sir Bernard, had a higher public profile &#8211; and to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">establish very clearly the impartiality of the process. Its relationship with the media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">needed to change. At the time when I took over as Press Secretary, the lobby briefings</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had got to a stage where two newspapers, the Guardian and the Independent, had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">exited the lobby, and my job really was to try and get back to a situation where</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">all newspapers could be represented there and felt able to attend, and indeed the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Guardian and the Independent did come back in to the lobby.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;So it was trying to establish general principles of the Prime Minister&#8217;s press secretary</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">being there clearly to present, in an impartial fashion, government policy, and to do</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that equally to all members of the media, both broadcast and newspapers.&#8221;</span>








 <p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The distance which Sir John put between himself and the national press did not prevent his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government from paying close attention to the press or from seeking to get their message</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">across to the press through briefings. Sir Christopher put it in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...Enormous attention was paid to editors of national newspapers &#8211; this extended,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to a degree, to regional editors, but not much &#8211; and so a considerable effort went</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">into courting them, bringing them around for privileged one-on-one briefings for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">example. This was in the early 1990s. I believe that that practice has now expanded</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">phenomenally over the years.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;So what it came down to was an exaggerated belief in the influence of the front</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">page headline and commentary columns within. There was an absolute belief that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapers and their editors could win or lose elections depending on how they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reported the stories.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I personally believe that that influence is gigantically exaggerated.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;So the result was we did pay &#8211; we, in Downing Street, did pay a lot of attention, more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">than I thought was necessary, to trying to pull people on board. And of course the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more you do that, the more demanding the editors and proprietors, in some cases,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">become. So I was always a bit sceptical about that.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As Philip Webster, the editor of The Times website and a former political editor with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">paper, observed in his evidence, Sir John built good relations with the press on his way to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Downing Street.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup> Once in office, between 1990 and 1992, Sir John received press which he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">himself thought was appropriate, and regarded as neither especially supportive nor hostile.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That, of course, falls to be contrasted with the extremely negative political coverage that was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accorded to the Leader of the Opposition during the same period.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By 1993, the evidence clearly shows that Mr Murdoch&#8217;s British titles were writing some very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hostile, and sometimes very personal, articles about Sir John. A selection of such articles was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attached to a briefing note which Lord O&#8217;Donnell produced for the then Prime Minister on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">18 August 1993.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup> Lord O&#8217;Donnell suggested in the note that Sir John took the opportunity of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a forthcoming meeting with Mr Murdoch to communicate to him the matters quoted below.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the result Sir John did not consider it appropriate to do so, not least because of the implied</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">threat, but the document nevertheless gives a flavour of the level of concern generated by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the adverse press coverage:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Your papers have made matters worse. They have ceased to make rational criticisms</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of policy. They are now simply anti everything and anti me in particular. (see attached</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cuttings.) This is bad for economic confidence and hence, bad for business. Longer</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">term political repercussions difficult to assess. Conservative MPs now see no reason</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to be helpful to media. [Pressure growing over privacy rules, VAT on newspapers,</span>





 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cross-ownership. I am not keen to move on any of these areas but MPs from all parties</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">becoming increasingly attracted to them.]&#8220;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-12"><a href="#para2-12" name="para2-12">2.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Peter Riddell described the coverage of the Major Government as becoming &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hostile</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref49" href="#footnote49">49</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Webster said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, there were occasions I think where the treatment of certain leaders got a little</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bit &#8211; was over the top, I think. I recall newspaper treatment of Neil Kinnock, John</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Major, latterly of Gordon Brown, where it got too personal and in a sense I felt that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was going a little bit too far. But I don&#8217;t regret the passing of the age of deference at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">all. I remember in the late 1960s, when I joined the Times, there was a much more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deferential attitude of reporters towards politicians. I am rather glad that is all gone.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It&#8217;s just in some cases I think the treatment has been just a little bit too personal at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">times.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There were probably many reasons for the change in coverage and the maintenance of its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">changed course. Antipathy to the Government&#8217;s policies and, in due course, the rise of New</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Labour were probably amongst them. But Sir John&#8217;s personal relationship, or rather lack of it,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with influential media figures of the time was probably also a factor. Mr Murdoch said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">51</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. So the support the Sun gave to the Tory Party. not that it was the strongest</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">support, because you, to put it bluntly, weren&#8217;t that appreciative of Sir John Major&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. Or his government. Well, we were reading in all the papers of cabinet divisions&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-14"><a href="#para2-14" name="para2-14">2.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Kelvin MacKenzie, then editor of The Sun, said something similar:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref52" href="#footnote52">52</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. First of all, were your relations with or respect for Mr John Major as good as they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were with Baroness Thatcher?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. No, they were &#8211; no, we didn&#8217;t have a &#8211; no, we did not have a particularly good</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relationship. He was no Thatcher, John Major.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was a conflict in the evidence of Mr MacKenzie and Sir John in relation to the content</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a telephone conversation which both men recalled took place late on Black Wednesday.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whatever the precise course of the conversation, however, it is noteworthy that the editor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of The Sun was amongst those, including HM The Queen and senior ministers, to have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">telephoned by the then Prime Minister.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-16"><a href="#para2-16" name="para2-16">2.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir John put it to the Inquiry that there had developed something of a culture of press hostility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to his administration, and personal ridicule of him, which resulted in coverage which went</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">beyond vigorous partisanship, and was not only unfair but inaccurate and misleading. He</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">cited what he considered to be the mischaracterisation of his Back to Basics initiative as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">moral crusade, certainly a depiction which had serious repercussions for his Government,</span>





 <span style="font-size: 15px;">and which was associated with (and was claimed as legitimising) highly intrusive coverage of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the sexual behaviour of a number of Conservative politicians.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref54" href="#footnote54">54</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-17"><a href="#para2-17" name="para2-17">2.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He also pointed to the caricaturing of the Citizens&#8217; Charter:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref55" href="#footnote55">55</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Similarly, a policy to improve the culture of public services was launched under the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">title &#8220;Citizens&#8217; Charter&#8221;. This policy was aimed at improving public services, ensuring</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">courtesy to the taxpayer who paid for them, and improving the esteem in which public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">servants and public services were held. The press undermined this campaign from the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">outset, through a total misrepresentation of the facts behind it &#8211; led by journalists</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who seemed to have no experience of public service and little care for it.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">added)<span style="font-style:italic"> .</span></span>

<p id="para-id-2-18"><a href="#para2-18" name="para2-18">2.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir John also pointed to a number of examples of unwarranted press intrusion into his private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and family life. These included the following:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) intrusion by a tabloid title into the family&#8217;s holiday home in Portugal to rearrange the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">furniture, take photographs and publish a story; Dame Norma Major telephoned the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editor to seek an explanation but was told that she and her husband had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> no</span><span style="font-style:italic"> right</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any privacy<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref56" href="#footnote56">56</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) an attempt to blag personal information about his son&#8217;s then girlfriend:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref57" href="#footnote57">57</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;on another occasion, my office received a telephone call purporting to be from the A&E</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Department of a hospital. The caller explained that my son&#8217;s then girlfriend had been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">involved in an accident and that emergency surgery was necessary. However, before</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this could be carried out, it was vital to know whether she was pregnant. Even though,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the face of it, this enquiry was clearly an urgent one, before giving any response my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">office made immediate contact with my son&#8217;s girlfriend, who was entirely well and in a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">meeting. For the record, she was not pregnant&#8221;;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) speculative surveillance of his son:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref58" href="#footnote58">58</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In circa 1996/7, my son was followed repeatedly by an individual on a motorbike, with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a long piece of equipment attached to his bike. My son became very alarmed, since this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was at a time when Northern Ireland was a much larger security concern than it is today</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and &#8211; through his rear view mirror &#8211; he believed the equipment might be a rifle. My son</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">followed the security procedures he&#8217;d been taught to follow, in order to &#8220;shake off&#8221; his</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pursuer, but to no avail. He therefore continued to drive, and requested assistance from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Cambridgeshire Armed Response Unit who flagged down the motorcycle and pulled</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it over. It turned out that the rider was a photographer for the News of the World, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the equipment was a telephoto lens. The motorcyclist had been instructed to follow my</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">son &#8220;day and night&#8221;, in the hope of providing a story.&#8221;;<span style="font-style:normal"> and</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) picture manipulation:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Following the General Election of 1997, I was on a private holiday. Following a picnic</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the beach, I tossed an empty bottle to my wife, who was immediately beside me,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">tidying up. The following day, a series of photographs appeared in one of the British</span>






 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">tabloids (from all of which my wife had been airbrushed), accusing me of tossing the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bottle onto an empty beach, and thus being a &#8217;litter lout&#8217;.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-19"><a href="#para2-19" name="para2-19">2.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was also this from Paul McMullan, the former News of the World journalist:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Yeah, I was sent to France &#8211; because I&#8217;d lived there and worked for an agency for a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">while &#8211; to try and track down the woman who took John Major&#8217;s virginity. This was a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">while ago. We found her but we couldn&#8217;t get a picture of her with her new boyfriend.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So the idea was she traded in John Major, the Prime Minister, for this French wrinkly.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think the cleaner was in the house, so I blagged my way in and pinched it off the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mantle piece and copied it. I remember at the time Rebekah Brooks said, &#8220;No, put</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it back, we&#8217;re not allowed to nick stuff!&#8221; And Piers said, &#8220;No, who cares? Well done.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We&#8217;ll put it in the paper.&#8221; Which is what we did.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-20"><a href="#para2-20" name="para2-20">2.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir John nevertheless fairly also said this about his personal coverage:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref61" href="#footnote61">61</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. You refer to your disengagement in the first sentence of paragraph 7. Would it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be fair to say, though, Sir John, that you were very sensitive about what was written</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about you by the press?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. It certainly would be, yes. I wouldn&#8217;t deny that at all in retrospect. It&#8217;s certainly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">true. I was much too sensitive from time to time about what the press wrote. God</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">knows, in retrospect, why I was, but I was...I woke up each morning and I opened the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">morning papers and I learned what I thought that I didn&#8217;t think, what I said that I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hadn&#8217;t said, what I was about to do that I wasn&#8217;t about to do.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;So there was a practical need to know what was going on but did I read them too</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">much? Yes, I did. Was it hurtful sometimes? Yes, it was. Did I think, it was malicious?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think that&#8217;s for others to make a judgment about.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-21"><a href="#para2-21" name="para2-21">2.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was a significant exchange between Mr Murdoch and Sir John shortly before the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">election. Sir John invited Mr Murdoch and his wife to dinner because he had been urged by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">party officials to &#8220;woo&#8221; newspaper proprietors. Sir John said this about the occasion:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref62" href="#footnote62">62</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...In the run-up to the 1997 election, in my third and last meeting with him on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2 February1997,hemadeitclearthathedislikedmyEuropeanpolicieswhichhewished</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">me to change. If not, his papers could not and would not support the Conservative</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Government. So far as I recall, he made no mention of editorial independence but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">referred to all his papers as &#8220;we&#8221;. Both Mr Murdoch and I kept our word. I made no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">change in policy, and Mr Murdoch&#8217;s titles did indeed oppose the Conservative Party...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-22"><a href="#para2-22" name="para2-22">2.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As Sir John observed:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref63" href="#footnote63">63</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It is not very often someone sits in front of a prime minister and says to a prime</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">minister: &#8220;I would like you to change your policy, and if you don&#8217;t change your policy,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my organisation cannot support you&#8221;. People may often think that, they may often</span>




 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">react &#8211;but it&#8217;s not often that point is directly put to a prime minister in that fashion,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">so it&#8217;s unlikely to have been something I would have forgotten.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-23"><a href="#para2-23" name="para2-23">2.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When Counsel to the Inquiry explored the nature of the opposition of Mr Murdoch&#8217;s papers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to his Government at the 1997 election, Sir John said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref64" href="#footnote64">64</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q ...the Sunday Times continued to support the Conservative Party and the Times&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">position was more equivocal, supporting anybody who happened to be anti-Europe&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A &#8220;Well, may I please have a definition of &#8220;support&#8221;? If you mean, did they perhaps</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">write an editorial saying, &#8220;On balance, the least of all evils is the Conservative and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you had better vote for them&#8221;, I think the answer is probably that they did. If you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mean: was there news coverage day in, day out, morning after morning, weekend</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">after weekend, hostile, then I would have to say to you that I think it was. So I think I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would have preferred to have less of the editorial support and more of the equitable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">news coverage&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-24"><a href="#para2-24" name="para2-24">2.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He did also acknowledge:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref65" href="#footnote65">65</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...After all, they had written about the Conservative Party between 1992 and 1997,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">how could they, in all credibility, have then said, &#8220;Despite all we have written over</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the past five years, we actually invite you to vote for these people we&#8217;ve been telling</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you are useless for five years&#8221;? I think that would have been quite a difficult editorial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">position to take&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-25"><a href="#para2-25" name="para2-25">2.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">More than one commentator has perceived a cyclical nature in the relationship between the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press and Prime Ministers, starting well and finishing badly. Mr Riddell suggested:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref66" href="#footnote66">66</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Recent prime ministers &#8211; John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211;have all sought close relations with the media, at various levels, from proprietors,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">through editors to political correspondents, during their rise to the top. But, when</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they have been in office for some time, the relationship has soured as media criticism</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">has increased, and each PM has complained about the stridency, intrusiveness and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">unfairness of the media. Both the initial closeness and later disillusion have been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">detrimental to the public interest. It would have healthier to have a more distant,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">workmanlike, relationship throughout.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-26"><a href="#para2-26" name="para2-26">2.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Webster agreed:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref67" href="#footnote67">67</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. You describe, rather like Mr Riddell, a circle whereby recent prime ministers and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you name John Major and Tony Blair as initially having very good relations with the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press but eventually becoming disillusioned; would you add Gordon Brown to that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">list?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. Yes, I would, yes. I think in all cases they began with good relations. John Major</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">built good relations with the press on his way to Downing Street. But he became very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">quickly disillusioned with the press afterwards&#8221;.</span>




 <p id="para-id-2-27"><a href="#para2-27" name="para2-27">2.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It would be perverse to suggest that Sir John&#8217;s relationship with the press was &#8216;too close&#8217; in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sense of too friendly, or such as to give rise to perceptions of mutual favour. It was, however,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">certainly personal. The lesson many subsequent politicians took from observation of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal destructiveness of the press towards political leaders such as Mr Foot, Lord Kinnock</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Sir John was a complex one. In part, it had to involve scrupulous reassessment of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unpopular policy positions. That in itself contained its own complexities: was unpopularity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the press the same as unpopularity with the public? How far did the press themselves</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">convince the public to dislike a policy, and was that fair or unfair? How should the personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dimension of a political leadership position be considered integral to the political? And, most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of all, what could be done about any of it? For some at least, one of the lessons taken from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these experiences was that previous relations between politicians and the press had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">&#8216;not close enough&#8217;.</span>
