<h2>1. Purchase of The Times and The Sunday Times</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 22 October 1980 Thomson British Holdings Limited (Thomson) announced its decision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to withdraw from the publication of The Times, The Sunday Times and their associated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publications and to cease publication of all the titles in March 1981 if a buyer could not be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">found by that time.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> It is well known that in the end a buyer was found: Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News International (NI). The acquisition of these iconic titles immediately gave NI an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important place in the national market for broadsheet newspapers. When combined with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">company&#8217;s existing tabloid titles, the News of the World and The Sun, it also conferred upon</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the company a very substantial share of the national newspaper market. The circumstances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by which NI came to acquire these influential titles has been the subject of controversy ever</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">since. This section of the Report examines that transaction for what it may tell us about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship between the press and politicians of the time.</span>

<h3>The decision to sell</h3>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is evident from the contemporary documents that Thomson&#8217;s ownership of Times</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Newspapers had, by the autumn of 1980, become commercially disastrous. The sale marked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a decision by Thomson to cut its losses and a conclusion that it had no realistic prospect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of reversing the position. At the root of Thomson&#8217;s problems was the state of industrial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relations. So severe was the problem that publication had been suspended for 11 months in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1978/79 amidst disputes over procedures, guarantees of continuous production, a new wage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">structure, manning levels and the operation of new technology. Publication was resumed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in November 1979 but many of the agreements reached between management and unions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">soon began to unravel. Industrial disruption in the shape of various forms of non-cooperation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from sections of the workforce prevented the operation of new technology. In August 1980</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was a further strike by members of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prevented publication of The Times and its supplements. During October 1980, The Sunday</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Times was damaged by action in the context of a dispute involving major matters of principle</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between members of the National Graphical Association (NGA) and the National Society of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operative Printers and Assistants (NATSOPA). That action alone, which affected production on</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">two successive weekends, is estimated to have cost Thomson &#163;500,000 in lost profits. Given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the continuing industrial unrest, the conclusion recorded at the time by Thomson was that:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> ...there</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> no</span><span style="font-style:italic"> possibility</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> an</span><span style="font-style:italic"> improvement</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> industrial</span><span style="font-style:italic"> relations</span><span style="font-style:italic"> at</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Times</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Newspapers,</span></span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The draft management plan for Times Newspapers produced in September 1980, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered by Thomson to be &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> optimistic</span> &#8221;, forecast continuing losses until 1982 and</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref1" name="footnote1" title="Go back to footnote reference 1 in the text">1</a>.

<span style="font-size: 15px;">came against the background of very substantial interest free loans made by Thomson to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Times Newspapers which, by 28 September 1980 totalled &#163;69.8.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> At the time, the company</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described its reasoning in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...the Board of TBH concluded that, in Thomson&#8217;s ownership, neither The Times nor</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Sunday Times was economic as a going concern and that, in the interests not only</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of shareholders but also of the Group&#8217;s employees, the present situation, if allowed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to continue, would threaten the future security and development of the Group as a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">whole.&#8221;</span>

<h3>Setting the deadline</h3>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of some importance to the later political debate was the manner in which it decided to put</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the titles on the market. In particular, and as described later in this section, the March 1981</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deadline for closure of the publications, unless a buyer could be found became fundamental</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Secretary of State&#8217;s reasoning when he later exercised his discretion to permit NI&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acquisition of the titles without a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">(MMC).</span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At the time Thomson asserted that it had to balance a number of factors: (i) its obligations to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">shareholders, as part of a public company, having regard to the scale of Times Newspapers&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">losses and the demands on the cash resources of the Group; (ii) its desire to see the titles</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">survive in other hands; (iii) the legal requirement to give 90 days&#8217; notice of potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">redundancies and begin consultations with the trade unions concerned; and (iv) the legal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessity to give certain minimum periods of notice to employees under the terms of their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">employment.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thomson recognised that any potential purchaser would have to reach satisfactory manning</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">andtechnologyagreementswiththeunions.Thomsonitselfhadbeentryingforyears,without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">success, to achieve just that. It was convinced that: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> The</span><span style="font-style:italic"> prospect</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> achieving</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> agreements</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">necessary to make the Titles economic exists only in the context that the alternative is the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">certain cessation of publication and the closure of the Titles&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Having</span><span style="font-style:normal"> adopted</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> deadline,</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thomson resolutely stuck to it. It appears to have worked. When writing to the Secretary of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">State on 23 January 1981 the company was able to state that since the announcement of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deadline production of the Times Newspapers titles had been efficient and uninterrupted.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Putting back the deadline would not have been an easy matter. Following the 22 October 1980</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">announcement, Thomson gave notice of redundancy proposals both to the Department of</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">Employmentandtotherelevanttradeunionsallowingforthestatutoryperiodofconsultation.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Notices to staff were issued at the end of November. Once issued, these notices could not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been withdrawn unilaterally.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Seven proposals, or serious indications of interest, were received by S.G. Warburg & Company</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Limited (Warburgs) before the end of year deadline set by Thomson. They came from:</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">(a) NI;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL);</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) Pergamon Press Limited;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) Lonrho Limited;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) Sea Containers Inc (for The Times only);</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(f) A consortium including Journalists of The Times (JOTT) (for The Times only); and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(g) Sir Harold Evans, editor of The Sunday Times, and his associates.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of other parties expressed but did not follow up an interest and two parties</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expressed an interest in the supplements only.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-10"><a href="#para1-10" name="para1-10">1.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In evaluating the bids and, before that, when deciding with whom to engage in serious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">negotiation, Thomson applied a range of non-financial criteria which were agreed by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Directors of Times Newspapers Holdings Limited (TNHL). These were:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) the new owner or owners should have (i) editorial credibility; (ii) commercial viability;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and (iii) managerial skills industrially;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) the new owners should be seen to have no direct religious, sectional or political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interests;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) the new owners should be of good reputation;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) the new owners should be asked if they would give a written guarantee of independence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the editors on similar lines to that which they have enjoyed under the Astor and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thomson ownership; if the appointment of the present editors was to continue then on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what terms;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) the new owners should, for preference, be British but Commonwealth and North</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">American would not be excluded; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(f) the new owners should be asked if they had any views on staff involvement or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consultation (this refers to JOTT), and would they agree a form of trust on similar lines</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the National Directors to act in event of further disposals?</span>

<p id="para-id-1-11"><a href="#para1-11" name="para1-11">1.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Other non-financial criteria upon which Thomson stated they placed considerable weight in</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">evaluating the proposals of the various parties included:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) their ability and determination to conclude complex and difficult negotiations with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">unions;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) the financial and managerial resources required to sustain and develop the titles;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) the strength of their commitment to support the individual titles; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) the views of the journalists.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref9" name="footnote9" title="Go back to footnote reference 9 in the text">9</a>.  pp16-17, <em>ibid</em></p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref10" name="footnote10" title="Go back to footnote reference 10 in the text">10</a>.  pp17-18, <em>ibid</em></p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1235"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-1-12"><a href="#para1-12" name="para1-12">1.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thomson&#8217;s strategy was to negotiate with a single purchaser of all the titles as a continuing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">business without interruption to production. It decided not to pursue negotiations with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other bidders unless a single purchaser and uninterrupted production proved impossible.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The reasons given by Thomson for adopting this approach were that the separate acquisition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of The Times would require its removal from the company&#8217;s Gray&#8217;s Inn Road complex, at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some considerable cost, cause the loss of 2,000 jobs, almost certainly cease publication for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a period, and risk industrial unrest which might seriously disrupt production of The Sunday</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Times.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-13"><a href="#para1-13" name="para1-13">1.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Fully understanding that any potential purchaser would only commit to the acquisition subject</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to a satisfactory deal with the unions, Thomson recognised the importance of maximising the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">chances of such an accommodation with the unions. The company decided that this was best</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">achieved by ensuring that negotiations with the unions should take place with not more than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one prospective purchaser of all the titles.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-14"><a href="#para1-14" name="para1-14">1.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The result of this approach was that, at the start of 1981, Thomson entered into serious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">negotiations with NI and ANL. Of the others who might have been eligible on these criteria,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lonrho did not in the end submit a specific proposal and, for reasons which are not fully</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained in the contemporary documents, but which appear to relate to the fact that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">company was owned by Robert Maxwell, Thomson chose not to negotiate with Pergamon</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press Limited.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-15"><a href="#para1-15" name="para1-15">1.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Internal discussion between Sir Denis Hamilton, Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of TNHL, Sir</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Harold Evans (as he now is) and William Rees-Mogg, then editor of The Times, resulted in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their unanimous agreement that Mr Murdoch was the most suitable future proprietor. Their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">agreement to this effect is recorded in a memorandum to Thomson from Sir Denis, dated 16</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">January 1981.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup> It is right that I qualify the agreement set out in that document by reference</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the oral evidence of Sir Harold, who indicated to the Inquiry that in fact his own support for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Murdoch was, quite naturally, secondary to his preference for his own bid. The explanation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the discrepancy between what is recorded in the document and Sir Harold&#8217;s oral evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seems to lie in Thomson&#8217;s negotiating strategy. Of course Sir Harold preferred his own bid,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but that was at this stage academic because Thomson was at that time only countenancing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bids for all of the titles, a restriction which excluded Sir Harold&#8217;s bid for The Sunday Times.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Harold&#8217;s preference, amongst those who were bidding for all of the titles, was for NI. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">memorandum gives eight numbered reasons for preferring Mr Murdoch. First, and perhaps</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">foremost amongst them, was the assessment that: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> He</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> highly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> effective</span><span style="font-style:italic"> manager.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> He,</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">therefore, has the best chance of success on his proven track record. He has built up a big</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">business entirely on his own. The company is in a tough spot. It needs a tough operator to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">survive.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> It</span><span style="font-style:normal"> is</span><span style="font-style:normal"> also</span><span style="font-style:normal"> interesting</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> note</span><span style="font-style:normal"> reason</span><span style="font-style:normal"> number</span><span style="font-style:normal"> 5:</span><span style="font-style:normal"> &#8220;</span> He is neither greatly to the Left or</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">greatly to the Right in his politics&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-16"><a href="#para1-16" name="para1-16">1.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In preferring NI&#8217;s bid, Thomson was not selecting the highest bidder. ANL offered more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">money. However, its bid was thought by Thomson to fall short on other grounds, specifically</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the fact that ANL was not prepared to commit to the continuance of the titles. Thomson also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">took into account the capacity of ANL to carry through the transaction and subsequently to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">manage the titles, and the likely reaction of interested parties, including the journalists, to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ownership of the titles by ANL.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having emerged as Thomson&#8217;s preferred bidder, the next step was for Mr Murdoch to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appear before the Editorial Vetting Committee of Times Newspapers, consisting of the then</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the then editors (Sir Denis Hamilton, Lord Dacre, Lord Greene, Lord Roll, Mr Evans and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Rees-Mogg). He did so on 21 January 1981. The purpose of the meeting was to evaluate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be an acceptable proprietor and at the heart of that process was establishing what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assurances Mr Murdoch would be prepared to give on matters such as: maintenance of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">titles, resources for their development; editorial independence and quality; board structures,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">especially continuance of the system of Independent National Directors; and restrictions on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the acquisition of shares by persons other than the purchaser.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-18"><a href="#para1-18" name="para1-18">1.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Vetting Committee was sufficiently impressed to recommend Mr Murdoch to the Board</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of TNHL as the preferred bidder. He secured the recommendation by providing a series of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">formal undertakings. The principal undertakings were published by TNHL on 22 January</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1981 in a press release and covered the preservation and enhancement of the system of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Independent National Directors; protection in relation to the appointment and dismissal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of editors; limitation on the disposition of titles; and, in some detail, the maintenance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editorial independence.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></span>

<h3>The Fair Trading Act 1973</h3>

<p id="para-id-1-19"><a href="#para1-19" name="para1-19">1.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A valid transfer of The Times and The Sunday Times to NI could not lawfully be executed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">without the written consent of the Secretary of State under s58 of the Fair Trading Act 1973.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The provision was engaged because the circulation of NI&#8217;s titles exceeded the limit stipulated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in s58(1). In the normal course of events the Secretary of State was prohibited from giving his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consent until he had received a report on the proposed transfer from the MMC. However, a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of exceptions to this rule were provided by the statute including, materially, s58(3)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) which provided that:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Where the Secretary of State is satisfied that the newspaper concerned in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">transfer is not economic as a going concern and as a separate newspaper then if he is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">also satisfied that, if the newspaper is to continue as a separate newspaper, the case</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is one of urgency, he may give his consent to the transfer without requiring a report</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from the Commission under this section ...&#8221;</span>
<h4>23 January 1981 &#8211; Thomson apply for consent</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-20"><a href="#para1-20" name="para1-20">1.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By letter dated 23 January 1981, James Evans, Joint Deputy Managing Director of The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thomson Organisation Limited applied to the Secretary of State for Trade, the Rt Hon John</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Biffen MP (as he then was) for written consents for the transfer of The Times and The Sunday</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Times from TNHL to NI.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup> A memorandum, enclosed with the letter, explained the factual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">background in support of the application.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-21"><a href="#para1-21" name="para1-21">1.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The basis for contending that the case was one of urgency was the March 1981 deadline</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which Thomson had itself imposed. In addition to citing the original reasons for setting the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deadline, the memorandum explained that it had resisted requests to extend the deadline</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and considered an extension to be impossible. Thomson steadfastly maintained its reliance</span>

<a name="page1237"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">upon its original reasons and cited five further reasons in support of its stance. They were as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) trade union opinion at a senior level is very strongly of the view that a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deadline for closure as an alternative to sale is essential if the necessary new</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">arrangements are to be made with their members, particularly at chapel level,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to secure the necessary cost reductions vital to the financial future of the Titles;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) since the announcement of October 1980 the staff of Times Newspapers have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">inevitably been under a very considerable strain due to the uncertainties of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">their future and to prolong this period of uncertainty could now easily lead to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">many of the staff seeking other employment thus jeopardising the ability of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Times Newspapers to continue publication of the Titles;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) in addition, if the March deadline was extended, even for a very limited period,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it would be necessary to withdraw a very large number of notices already</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">issued, particularly those which terminate simultaneously with the deadlines.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Since notices cannot be withdrawn unilaterally by the employer and must be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">subject to the agreement of the individual employee, it is highly likely that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">trade unions concerned would seek to exact a heavy price for agreement to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">withdrawal of notices or any extension of the notice period. Other alternatives</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">such as the offer of short-term engagements have been considered but give</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rise to legal consequences involving a cost exposure which it is impossible to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">risk. Even if some employees were willing to cooperate, a position could easily</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">emerge in which an insufficient number did so and the company would then</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be faced with a contractual commitment to pay those employees for a further</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">period yet be unable to produce the Titles.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(d) in the consultations which have already taken place with the trade unions</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">since 22 October 1980, there has been great pressure from the trade unions to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">discuss redundancy terms on the basis of closure. The company has declined</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to do so, mainly for the reason that so long as there is a possibility of sale it is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not only inappropriate to do so but inadvisable. The terms of redundancy on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">closure are likely to be a very contentious issue and discussion of them would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">run a grave risk of causing disruption at a time when continuity of production</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is vital for the prospects of sale. It will be necessary, for legal reasons, to enter</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">into discussions of redundancy terms on the basis of closure within a very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">short time. If there is a further period of uncertainty as to whether or not a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sale can be achieved, this could jeopardise the negotiations now beginning</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for the improvements required as a pre-condition of sale and survival of the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">Titles;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(e) further uncertainty could have very adverse trading consequences. While</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">readers and advertisers have remained loyal to the Titles not only through the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">period of 11 months&#8217; suspension but also through erratic publication caused</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by industrial disruption, there are now signs that advertisers are becoming</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reluctant to commit ahead in terms of booking space except on a short-term</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">basis, and this is a particular problem for The Sunday Times Colour Magazine</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">because of its longer &#8220;lead&#8221; time to publication. In order to secure sufficient</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bookings for issues subsequent to 8 March, the Sunday Times Colour Magazine</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is now having to offer substantial discounts to advertisers. This has very</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref19" name="footnote19" title="Go back to footnote reference 19 in the text">19</a>.  pp10-12, <em>ibid</em></p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1238"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">serious implications in view of the importance of the magazine to the financial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">position of The Sunday Times.&#8221;</span>
<h4>26 January 1981 &#8211; Mr Biffen&#8217;s consideration of the application</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-22"><a href="#para1-22" name="para1-22">1.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Biffen acted with great speed. On 26 January 1981, he met first Thomson and then Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch, before attending a meeting of the Cabinet Ministerial Committee on Economic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Strategy.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-23"><a href="#para1-23" name="para1-23">1.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The fact that Mr Biffen met Mr Evans, who acted on behalf of Thomson, on the morning of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">26 January 1981, and the substance of their discussions, is evidenced by the letter which the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">latter sent to the former later the same day. Mr Biffen attempted to persuade Thomson to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extend the deadline and indicated that it would be reasonable to hope for a report from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MMC by 25 March 1981. The letter sets out Thomson&#8217;s substantive response to that request.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The company remained immovable on the subject, making essentially the same points as are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">set out in their earlier memorandum of 23 January 1980 (discussed above) but also relying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">upon a condition in their agreement with NI that, if the Secretary of State&#8217;s agreement had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not been obtained by 12 February 1981, then the agreement would not have effect.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-24"><a href="#para1-24" name="para1-24">1.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Biffen&#8217;s meeting with Mr Murdoch is evidenced by an office minute prepared by Mr Biffen&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">officials. It is an important document, not least because it records Mr Biffen as being minded,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at that time, to refer the transfer to the MMC:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;1 The Secretary of State said that there was a presumption behind the legislation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that he had to refer a newspaper merger automatically to the MMC unless particular</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">financial and timing considerations applied which allowed him to exercise discretion</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">over whether the merger should be referred or not. He said that he had still to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">come to a decision on whether these considerations applied in this instance though</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he admitted that he was prejudiced in favour of a reference in order to defuse any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">criticism of the bid&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-25"><a href="#para1-25" name="para1-25">1.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Murdoch signalled to the Secretary of State his willingness to maintain his bid if Thomson</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extendeditsself-imposeddeadline.Althoughhewasatpainstoexplainthatanysuchextension</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would create problems both for him and for Thomson. He thought that an extension of about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">two months would be required, on the assumption that the MMC reported favourably by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">25 March 1981, because of the need thereafter to negotiate with the unions.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-26"><a href="#para1-26" name="para1-26">1.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Biffen maintained his preference for a referral to the MMC throughout the meeting. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does not appear to have ventilated any concerns about plurality. Rather, his concern appears</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to have been to avoid criticism. The final paragraph of the minute states:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;8 The Secretary of State concluded that in his political judgment an MMC</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation would be the best means of defusing criticism. He considered that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">MMC would be able to complete a report in about eight weeks and he hoped that Mr</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Despite his clear preference for an MMC investigation, Mr Biffen did explore the alternative at</span>

<p id="para-id-1-28"><a href="#para1-28" name="para1-28">1.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At 4.45hrs on the same day, Mr Biffen attended a meeting of the Cabinet Ministerial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Committee on Economic Strategy, chaired by the then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Times Newspapers was one of two items discussed. In the intervening period between his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meetings with Mr Evans and Mr Murdoch and the meeting of the Cabinet Committee, Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Biffen had received Thomson&#8217;s letter declining to extend their self-imposed deadline because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he was aware of it by the time of the meeting.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-29"><a href="#para1-29" name="para1-29">1.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is clear from the minutes that Mr Biffen understood the test which he was required to apply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under s58(3)(a) Fair Trading Act 1973 and that his Cabinet colleagues correctly understood</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the decision had to be taken by Mr Biffen and not collectively. Mr Biffen reported that:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...On the basis of advice from his Department&#8217;s accountants, he was satisfied that neither</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Times nor The Sunday Times was economic as a going concern, though only in the case</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of The Times was the issue clear-cut. He was also satisfied the case was one of urgency ...&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Consequently, discussion was focused on whether Mr Biffen should exercise his discretion to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consent to the merger without prior reference to the MMC. The minute succinctly records</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">how Mr Biffen appears to have regarded the choice before him:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...He (the Secretary of State), therefore had two alternatives open to him. He could</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">make a reference to the MMC in the hope that the Thomson Organisation would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">then extend their deadlines, but with the risks of causing TBH to lose a substantial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sum of money, of declaring around 4,000 redundancies, and of bringing about what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">might prove to be the permanent closure of The Times. Alternatively he could give his</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consent without a reference, subject to a condition which would in effect entrench</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the undertakings which Mr Murdoch had given, bearing on the independence of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the papers and on editorial freedom, and ensure that they could not be changed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">thereafter without his consent.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-30"><a href="#para1-30" name="para1-30">1.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In discussion it was thought unlikely that Thomson would refuse to extend their deadline in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the event of a referral, but that there was little advantage in a reference and considerable risks</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and costs in making it. Thomson had taken the view that no suitable alternative purchaser</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">had made a bid. Those who were pressing for a reference were mainly concerned to secure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">greater authority behind the undertakings on independence which had already been given.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This concern should be met by entrenching the undertakings in the consent. The Opposition,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was thought, might be less inclined to press for a reference when they understood the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potential consequences. It was left to Mr Biffen to make his decision.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup></span>

<a name="page1240"></a><!--new page--><h4>27 January 1981 &#8211; Mr Biffen&#8217;s decision and debate in Parliament</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-31"><a href="#para1-31" name="para1-31">1.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An Emergency Debate was held in the House of Commons on 27 January 1981 to discuss</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a reference of the transfer to the MMC. Contrary to the hopes expressed in Cabinet the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">previous day, the Opposition pressed vigorously for a reference. The Rt Hon John Smith MP</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pointed first to the concentration of newspaper power which would result from the transfer,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">describing it as:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;probably</span><span style="font-style:italic"> unique</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> unprecedented</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> our</span><span style="font-style:italic"> history&#8221;</span> ;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup> second, to the special</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">place of The Times and The Financial Times in national life; and third to the mechanism for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scrutiny afforded under the Fair Trading Act 1973. As to that Act, he contended that The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sunday Times was economic as a going concern. The undertakings given by Mr Murdoch, he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argued, removed rather than strengthened existing safeguards.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-32"><a href="#para1-32" name="para1-32">1.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The financial issue was contested by Mr Biffen, who insisted that he had to look at the issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under the existing ownership and under present conditions. He was supported in his approach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the Rt Hon Peter Emery MP, who had been the Minister responsible for getting the Act</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">onto the statute book.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup> Mr Biffen also made clear his view that there was a real possibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of closure if he chose to refer the matter to the MMC, pointing out that he had no power to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compel the MMC to produce a report to an abridged timetable. He concluded:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;After earnest consideration, and to avoid disruption and uncertainty, I have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">concluded that I should give my consent forthwith, and without a Monopolies and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mergers Commission investigation, to the transfer of Times Newspapers to News</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">International, subject to certain conditions.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-33"><a href="#para1-33" name="para1-33">1.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The eight conditions referred to were firmly entrenched. Those relating to editorial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independence were incorporated into the articles of association of the relevant companies.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Any change to them required the Secretary of State&#8217;s consent. All of the conditions, if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breached, were potentially the subject of criminal proceedings and a custodial sentence.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sections 62(2) and 62(3) of the Fair Trading Act 1973 provided:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">those conditions, as the case may be shall be guilty of an offence&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;(3) A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable, on conviction on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to a fine or to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">both&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">At the end of the debate, Mr Biffen quoted Sir Harold Evans who had said earlier in the</span>

<a name="page1241"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence to the Inquiry, that what he said was in the context of his still preferring his own bid</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">to that of NI.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-35"><a href="#para1-35" name="para1-35">1.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The debate did not split strictly down party lines. Jonathan Aitken MP (Conservative), who,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as the great-nephew of Lord Beaverbrook, had family connections with a newspaper empire</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">spoke against the transfer, warning:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The plain fact is that Mr Murdoch has strewn assurances and safeguards on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspaper and television ownership like confetti, all round the world, and the more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">one examines those assurances the more one has to say that in far too many instances</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they have proved to be worthless.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-36"><a href="#para1-36" name="para1-36">1.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Aitken was one of a number of MPs who criticised Thomson&#8217;s self-imposed deadline and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">believed that there were other credible bidders. He put it graphically:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Lord Thomson and Mr Murdoch are putting a phoney pistol to the head of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State and saying to him, in effect, &#8220;Stand and deliver without your</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reference to the commission.&#8221; I believe he should have called their bluff, because</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there were plenty of other serious alternative bidders in the ring&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-37"><a href="#para1-37" name="para1-37">1.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">From the other side of the political fence, Ron Leighton MP (Labour), who was a sponsored</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">member of the printing union NATSOPA, made clear the support of the trade unions for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">NI bid:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The printing trade unions and, I understand, a very large number of journalists</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">take the view that the best chance of keeping the publications in existence is Rupert</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Murdoch &#8211; not Atlantic Richfield or Associated Newspapers ...it is our view that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">most viable offer is the one from Murdoch&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-38"><a href="#para1-38" name="para1-38">1.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Two MPs alleged at the time that the decision was, in reality, that of the then Prime Minister.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Firstly, Phillip Whitehead MP opined:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I detect the opinions of the Prime Minister. I think that it is the Prime Minister who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">has dictated that Rupert is owed a favour and that the proposal should not go to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the commission. The Minister is an honourable man and a man somewhat given to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">private and public agonising.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Biffen rejected that suggestion.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-39"><a href="#para1-39" name="para1-39">1.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, the Rt Hon Geoffrey Robinson MP said: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> In</span><span style="font-style:italic"> this</span><span style="font-style:italic"> his</span><span style="font-style:italic"> first</span><span style="font-style:italic"> major</span><span style="font-style:italic"> decision</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> right</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hon. Gentleman has failed to stand up to the Prime Minister. That is the reality...This is a</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">straightforward pay-off for services rendered by<span style="font-style:normal"> The</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Sun</span> .<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref38" href="#footnote38">38</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-40"><a href="#para1-40" name="para1-40">1.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the result, the motion was defeated by 281 votes to 239 and the transfer took place without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a reference to the MMC.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-41"><a href="#para1-41" name="para1-41">1.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The debate was followed by a brief correspondence between Mr Smith and Mr Biffen, about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the figures upon which the Secretary of State had relied. By letter dated 3 February 1981,</span>

<a name="page1242"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Biffen conceded that he had made an error in the House but, for reasons which were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained in the letter, stood by the overall conclusion that neither The Times nor The Sunday</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Times was economic.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref39" href="#footnote39">39</a></sup></span>
<h4>The decision not to commence judicial review proceedings</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-42"><a href="#para1-42" name="para1-42">1.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The reaction of journalists at The Sunday Times was such that initially a legal challenge by way</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of judicial review of Mr Biffen&#8217;s decision seemed likely. In the result support for such action</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">collapsed. Sir Harold Evans explained that this change of heart was the result of concern that,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if a claim had been successfully brought, and a reference to the MMC ordered, The Times</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might have been lost.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup></span>

<h3>The continuing controversy</h3>

<p id="para-id-1-43"><a href="#para1-43" name="para1-43">1.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Allegations that the Minister might have taken into account irrelevant political considerations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were not only raised in Parliament but repeated outside. In his diary entry for 14 June 1987,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Wyatt states that he told Mr Murdoch that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I reminded Rupert during the evening how at his request and at my instigation she</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had stopped the Times acquisition being referred to the Monopolies Commission</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">though the Sunday Times was not really losing money and the pair together were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">not.&#8220;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-44"><a href="#para1-44" name="para1-44">1.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The entry for 1 December 1995 recites a conversation with Dr Irwin and Cita Stelzer, recording</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he (Wyatt) had said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I had all the rules bent for him over The Sunday Times and The Times when he bought</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">them. Because of the strikes the Sunday Times was at that time losing a bomb, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">so was the Times. Through Margaret I got it arranged that the deal didn&#8217;t go to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Monopolies Commission which almost certainly would have blocked it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-45"><a href="#para1-45" name="para1-45">1.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Harold Evans was explicit in his suggestion to the Inquiry that there had in fact been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">something of a transaction in this matter between Baroness Thatcher and Mr Murdoch.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup> He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also said that he was told that Baroness Thatcher had determined the titles must go to Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch because she valued his support:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I was told by someone I know that Mrs Thatcher had determined it must go to Mr</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Murdoch because she valued his support. In this belief, I was supportive of Mr Hugh</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Stephenson at The Times, who had it from a friend in the Cabinet Office that Mrs</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Thatcher&#8217;s real debt of gratitude was the crucial factor in doing it. Lord Donoughue,</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Bernard Donoughue, had it from the Cabinet Office that she owed him a debt. He had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">supported her in the last election, and would support him in the next. Mr Jim Prior</span>

<h3>Lunch at Chequers</h3>

<p id="para-id-1-46"><a href="#para1-46" name="para1-46">1.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">More than 30 years after the events in question, in March 2012, and not long before Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch gave evidence to the Inquiry, previously unpublished documents were released</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the Churchill Archives Centre. These revealed that Mr Murdoch had visited Chequers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for lunch with Baroness Thatcher on Sunday 4 January 1981. This was a surprise because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Murdoch had not told the author of<span style="font-style:italic"> The</span><span style="font-style:italic"> History</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Times,</span> Graham Stewart, about it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when interviewed in 1995. Sight of the documents, which he did not dispute, did not rekindle</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any recollection.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup> In the light of that, and of the allegations of influence made in 1981 and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thereafter, these documents call for careful scrutiny.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-47"><a href="#para1-47" name="para1-47">1.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Events are primarily recorded in a four page note for the record produced by Sir Bernard</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ingham (as he became) the day afterwards.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup> The lunch was attended by Baroness and Sir</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Denis Thatcher, Sir Bernard and Mr Murdoch. It was at Mr Murdoch&#8217;s request. There was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discussion of President Reagan&#8217;s then embryonic administration and of Australian politics.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The main purpose of Mr Murdoch&#8217;s visit though was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> ...to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> brief</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Prime</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Minister</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> his</span><span style="font-style:italic"> bid</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">turning the business around are set out in some detail. Mr Murdoch pointed out the scale</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the financial risk that he was taking and the difficult economic climate in which he would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have to operate. He also speculated about the other bids which he thought had been made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(Sir Bernard had tried but failed to establish through the Department of Trade information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the bids).</span>

<p id="para-id-1-48"><a href="#para1-48" name="para1-48">1.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The impression given by the note is that Mr Murdoch did most of the talking. Sir Bernard was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">careful to record the passive role played by Baroness Thatcher in the last paragraph of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">document:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Prime Minister thanked Mr. Murdoch for keeping her posted on his operations.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">She did no more than wish him well in his bid, noting the need for much improved</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mr Murdoch made it clear that in his view the prime need, given the inevitability of</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">levels.&#8221;</span>

<a name="page1244"></a><!--new page--><h3>Reflections</h3>

<p id="para-id-1-50"><a href="#para1-50" name="para1-50">1.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There appears to be little reason to doubt the difficulty of the situation faced by Thomson</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the autumn of 1980. Electing to cut their losses was a commercial decision in the face of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mounting losses and real industrial relations problems. The reasons which they recorded at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the time explain why it was important for them to set a deadline. Other aspects of Thomson&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behaviour fall well within the range of reasonable responses for an organisation in its position.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Looked at from the company&#8217;s point of view, Thomson&#8217;s preference for a single bidder with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the means to purchase the whole of Times Newspapers is understandable. The successful sale</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of either title individually could have jeopardised the fortunes of the other. Their choice of Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch as preferred bidder, later endorsed by the Times Vetting Committee, is explicable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the merits of his bid. ANL, the other serious contender for a purchase of both titles, would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not commit to maintaining them both. Mr Murdoch was thought to be a man capable of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">negotiating successfully with the trade unions. Indeed, he was the preferred choice of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">trade unions. Most significantly for the purposes of this Report, there is no evidence that any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political pressure was put upon Thomson to prefer NI&#8217;s bid.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-51"><a href="#para1-51" name="para1-51">1.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, that there was a confidential meeting between the then Prime Minister and Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch, the fact of which did not emerge into the public domain for more than 30 years, is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">troubling in its lack of transparency. It serves as a reminder of the importance of contemporary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice to make public the fact of such meetings. The perceptions at the time and since of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">collusive arrangements between the Prime Minister and the preferred bidder are corrosive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of public confidence.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-52"><a href="#para1-52" name="para1-52">1.52</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Not surprisingly, the contemporary documents do not evidence any form of express &#8216;deal&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between Mr Murdoch and anyone in the Government of the day, including the Prime Minister.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The note of the meeting itself is careful to record that Baroness Thatcher did no more than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wish Mr Murdoch well. The minutes of the Cabinet Ministerial Committee on Economic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Strategy demonstrate that the committee was well aware that the decision was ultimately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for Mr Biffen alone. They are corroborated by Mr Biffen&#8217;s contemporaneous denial that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">took irrelevant considerations into account.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-53"><a href="#para1-53" name="para1-53">1.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Why then did Mr Murdoch seek an invitation to Chequers? The prospective deal was plainly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of great importance to him. He no doubt believed that there was real value in meeting the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prime Minister face-to-face, to inform her of his bid and his plans in the event that it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">successful, and importantly, to form a personal connection. He would have expected to make</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a good impression on Baroness Thatcher; he would have known of her respect for risk taking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">entrepreneurs, and that they would have thought alike on the merits of turning around a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">troubled newspaper company with industrial relations problems. Their world views had much</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in common.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup> There is no evidence that the approach made any difference to the outcome</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of events; nevertheless, Mr Murdoch was no doubt making an investment, not least in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context of the union confrontation which both would have seen in the future.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-54"><a href="#para1-54" name="para1-54">1.54</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have carefully considered what conclusions (whether as to fact or credibility), if any, I should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">draw from Mr Murdoch&#8217;s inability to recall the meeting either when interviewed for the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">History of The Times<span style="font-style:normal"> or</span><span style="font-style:normal"> when</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> appeared</span><span style="font-style:normal"> before</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Inquiry.</span><span style="font-style:normal"> It</span><span style="font-style:normal"> is</span><span style="font-style:normal"> perhaps</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span><span style="font-style:normal"> little</span><span style="font-style:normal"> surprising</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he does not remember a visit to a place as memorable as Chequers, in the context of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bid as important as that which he made for Times Newspapers. However, perhaps that is all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I need to say.</span>

<h2>2. Response to the reports of Sir David Calcutt QC</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Report has already considered the background to, and conclusions of, the Calcutt Reviews</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in some detail.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">51</a></sup> This section of the Report does not seek to repeat any of that detail but to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examine the political response to the Calcutt Reviews.</span>
<h4>The first Calcutt Report</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir David Calcutt QC published his first report on Privacy and Related Matters in June 1990. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was highly critical of the existing Press Council and set out in clear terms the failings of that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisation. It recommended that the Press Council be abolished and replaced with a new</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">self-regulatory organisation, the Press Complaints Commission. The report recommended</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this new organisation should deal with the numerous and substantial concerns that had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been raised around the behaviour of some parts of the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The report recommended that the new PCC be given 18 months to demonstrate that self-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation could work effectively. Sir David recommended that, if this challenge could not be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">met, then an independent complaints-handling tribunal should be set up (which would have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">required legislation). The details of the recommendations are set out elsewhere.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref52" href="#footnote52">52</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The response of the industry was swift but selective. The Press Council was disbanded, and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press Standards Board of Finance (PressBoF) was created for the purpose of funding the PCC.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC itself was incorporated on 1 January 1991. However, many of the recommendations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made in the first Calcutt report were not implemented by the PCC. For instance, the Code of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Conduct was promulgated by the industry rather than the PCC itself, and the appointments to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thePCCweremadebythenewChairman,ratherthanbywayofanindependentappointments</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">process.</span>
<h4>The second Calcutt Report</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Concern about the conduct of the press continued and was not dispelled by the PCC. The final</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">straw appears to have been the publication in The Sun of the detail of intimate conversations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between the Princess of Wales and James Gilbey, and the Prince of Wales and the Duchess</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Cornwall (as she now is). On 9 July 1992, Sir David was asked by the Rt Hon David Mellor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">QC MP, Secretary of State for National Heritage, to conduct a second review and he did so,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reporting in January 1993.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In summary, Sir David&#8217;s second report made clear his view that the press was neither able nor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">willing to initiate reforms that might constitute a credible form of self-regulation in which the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public could have confidence. He put it in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Press Complaints Commission is not, in my view, an effective regulator of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press. It has not been set up in a way, and is not operating a code of practice, which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enables it to command not only press but also public confidence. It does not, in my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">view, hold the balance fairly between the press and the individual. It is not the truly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">independent body which it should be.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">He therefore recommended that the proposals set out in his first report for a Press Complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Tribunal be enacted as soon as possible. The detail of his recommendations is set out more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fully above,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref54" href="#footnote54">54</a></sup> but can be summarised as having three main &#8216;strands&#8217; as follows:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) the PCC should be disbanded and replaced by an independent Press Complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Tribunal;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) the introduction of new criminal offences, making it a criminal offence to enter property</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with a view to obtaining personal information without consent, to place surveillance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">devices on private property without consent, or to photograph or record someone on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private property without consent. Various defences were proposed; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) consideration of a new tort of privacy.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both the PCC and the industry opposed Sir David&#8217;s analysis. The PCC suggested an alternative;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">namely amendments to the Code of Practice, new guidance for journalists and some changes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the way in which the PCC was run and governed.</span>

<h3>The Political Response: David Mellor</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In December 1989, some six months before Sir David&#8217;s first report, Mr Mellor was a Home</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Office Minister of State, working to David Waddington MP, who was then Home Secretary. At</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that time, prior to the creation of the Department of National Heritage following the 1992</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">election, the Home Office was responsible for media policy. Mr Mellor gave a television</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interview in that month indicating that, in the light of Sir David&#8217;s forthcoming report, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press were now drinking in the &#8216;last chance saloon&#8217;. These were words the press were never</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to forget.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Mellor became Secretary of State for National Heritage on 11 April 1992, just over a year</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">after the PCC had been created. Shortly after commissioning Sir David Calcutt&#8217;s review, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">July 1992, Mr Mellor was the subject of a &#8220;kiss and tell&#8221; story, in which the actress Antonia</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">de Sancha sold her story of his extra-marital affair with her. Conversations between Ms De</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sancha and Mr Mellor had been recorded and were then published in The Sun. Although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Mellor survived in office, the press pursued details of his private life and published a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of further stories about him, including one which alleged that he had enjoyed two</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">free holidays; one as the guest of the daughter of an official of the Palestine Liberation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Organisation and one as the guest of the ruler of Abu Dhabi. Finally, after weeks of personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and negative coverage, Mr Mellor resigned on 24 September 1992.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Mellor felt at the time that he had been hounded out of office by the press as a result of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his comments and his formal request to Sir David to conduct a second review; asked by the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry whether he believed that the timing of the adverse articles was deliberate, however,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref55" href="#footnote55">55</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;No, I think it was coincidental, because interestingly, the News of the World had the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">first chance at the de Sancha story and elected not to publish it, so... I think it was just,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you know, an inconvenient moment for one&#8217;s private life to fall out of the cupboard.&#8221;</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref54" name="footnote54" title="Go back to footnote reference 54 in the text">54</a>.  Part D, Chapter 1</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref55" name="footnote55" title="Go back to footnote reference 55 in the text">55</a>.  p30, lines 7-11, David Mellor MP, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-26-June-2012.pdf</p><!--footnote-->

<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, he did claim that coverage of the the &#8216;kiss and tell&#8217; story had been personal and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disproportionate, and that the press did appear to be pursuing a personal attack:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref56" href="#footnote56">56</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;What shouldn&#8217;t happen, though, is it then becomes a sort of vendetta and people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">then go around thinking because you are a wounded animal, rather like in those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nature films, you know, the beast can sort of rip you to bits without any worry about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fairness, truth or anything and you know, we come to the wretched Chelsea shirt. You</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know ... fan that I am of Chelsea Football Club, I have never owned a Chelsea shirt.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Never felt the need to &#8211; and that was a total invention.... Insofar as my rather sad and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pathetic little Chelsea shirt incident has any relevance... it shows a press that was out</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of control and had no concern with the truth whatsoever, no concern with the public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interest. They were just having a laugh and I was stupid enough to put myself in a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">position where they could laugh at me, fool that I was&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although Mr Mellor took the view that the timing of the articles, shortly after he announced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the second Calcutt Review, was coincidental, there is no doubt that there was a measure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of press triumphalism at his resignation. The day after his resignation, The Sun&#8217;s front page</span>

<h3>Lord Brooke</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-14"><a href="#para2-14" name="para2-14">2.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Mellor was replaced as Secretary of State for National Heritage by the Rt Hon Peter Brooke</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MP, now Lord Brooke. Lord Brooke was Secretary of State for National Heritage between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">September 1992 and July 1994. As such, he was Secretary of State for the period immediately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">following the publication of Sir David&#8217;s second report and the first of two Secretaries of State</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with responsibility for responding to that report. He described this role in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I should stress that my involvement in that response [the government&#8217;s response to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Sir David&#8217;s second report] was my principal media responsibility during my 22 months</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">as Secretary of State&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is important to note from the outset that although Sir David&#8217;s second report was published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in January 1993, the Government&#8217;s response to it did not emerge until 1995, after Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Brooke&#8217;s time as Secretary of State. He explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;the chronological narrative indicates how not once but twice we ran out of time to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">settle the genuine departmental differences between us&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">He concluded:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref61" href="#footnote61">61</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;only historians can fully determine how, where or why we failed, which of course I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regard as an embarrassment&#8221;.</span>

<a name="page1248"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry was interested in understanding how and why there was no consensus, why</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the process took so long, and why so little was ultimately done. In order to answer these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">questions, it is necessary to consider the chronological narrative in a little detail.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-16"><a href="#para2-16" name="para2-16">2.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Upon publication of the second report in January 1993, Lord Brooke made an oral statement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the House of Commons. Having made clear that a final response would have to await the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">report of the Select Committee on National Heritage on Privacy and Media Intrusion and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the outcome of the debate on Mr Soley&#8217;s Bill,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref62" href="#footnote62">62</a></sup> Lord Brooke indicated that the Government</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was broadly supportive of Sir David&#8217;s recommendations relating to privacy, such as the case</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for new criminal offences to deal with specified types of physical intrusion, and that further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consideration should be given to the introduction of a new tort of infringement of privacy as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommended. However, on the central recommendation that a Press Complaints Tribunal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be set up, he put the Government&#8217;s position this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref63" href="#footnote63">63</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I turn now to Sir David&#8217;s recommendation that the Government should introduce a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">statutory regime for dealing with complaints against the press. That raises separate,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and more difficult, issues which need to be carefully weighed. The Government agree</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with Sir David that the Press Complaints Commission, as at present constituted, is not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an effective regulator of the press. It is not truly independent and its procedures are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deficient. Sir David&#8217;s detailed analysis of those shortcomings is compelling. We also</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recognise the strength of the case that he makes in his report for a statutory tribunal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with wide-ranging powers. At the same time, we are conscious that action to make</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">such a body statutory would be a step of some constitutional significance, departing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from the traditional approach to press regulation in this country. In the light of those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">considerations, the Government would be extremely reluctant to pursue that route. A</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">most persuasive case for statutory regulation would need to be made out.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-17"><a href="#para2-17" name="para2-17">2.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That was also the view of the press. The report of the Select Committee on National Heritage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was published on 24 March 1993.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref64" href="#footnote64">64</a></sup> In summary, it recommended a new Protection of Privacy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Bill, but rejected the recommendation for a press complaints tribunal concluding that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> unless</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">future events show such a tribunal to be utterly unavoidable<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;,</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref65" href="#footnote65">65</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> it</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> preferable</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> rely</span><span style="font-style:normal"> on</span></span>

<h4>Strand 1: The Press Complaints Tribunal</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-18"><a href="#para2-18" name="para2-18">2.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In rejecting the proposal of a tribunal, the Select Committee did propose the appointment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a Press Ombudsman (which would also have required legislation), on the basis that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> a</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regulatory level is needed beyond that of the Press Commission<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span><span style="font-style:normal"> The</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Ombudsman,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> it</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">been rejected without an investigation.&#8217;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref66" href="#footnote66">66</a></sup> Lord Wakeham (then the Chairman of the Cabinet</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 28 June 1993, Lord Brooke minuted Lord Wakeham saying that the White Paper would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acknowledge the steps already taken to meet some of the Calcutt and Select Committee</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criticisms, but that the Government preferred to retain self-regulation. It was clear therefore</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from that date that the Government had decided to reject the proposals for a either a Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Complaints Tribunal, or a Press Ombudsman.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-20"><a href="#para2-20" name="para2-20">2.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 29 July 1993 the Lord Chancellor&#8217;s Department, in conjunction with the Scottish Office,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">published a consultation paper. This floated the idea of a voluntary press Ombudsman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scheme being set up within the PCC itself. In September 1993, Lord Brooke gave a speech to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Conservative Party conference, referring to the concept of a &#8216;voluntary Ombudsman&#8217;. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">November 1993, he gave a speech to the Institute of Public Relations, calling on the press to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">establish such a voluntary Press Ombudsman. Again, as will be seen, this was never something</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken up by either the press or by Government.</span>
<h4>Strand 2: criminal offences</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-21"><a href="#para2-21" name="para2-21">2.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 14 January 1993, Lord Brooke made a statement to the House of Commons in which he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said this about the new proposed criminal offences:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref68" href="#footnote68">68</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Government accepts the case for new criminal offences to deal with specified</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">types of physical intrusion and covert surveillance ... Subject to further examination of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the details of the proposed offences ... The Government will bring forward legislation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">in due course&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-22"><a href="#para2-22" name="para2-22">2.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By May 1993, the Cabinet had agreed that the Criminal Justice Bill, to be introduced either</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that year or the following year, should include provisions on intrusion. Indeed, Lord Brooke</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">told the Inquiry that, before a Cabinet meeting in June 1993, Sir John Major had expressed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest in seeing details of proposed criminal offences. At that meeting, the new proposed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal offences were discussed. Lord Brooke told the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref69" href="#footnote69">69</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;CriminaloffenceshadbeendiscussedonJune24<span style="font-size: 9px;"> th</span> in termsofParliamentaryhandling.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I sought to reach agreement with the Home Secretary and that the offences should</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">apply to those who profited from, or even used without profit, the results of illegal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">intrusion. The intrusion and the use of the material should thus be separate offences.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The offences should only apply to personal information but the offences should be in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the 1993-4 session of legislation, having been accepted as far back as 1990&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-23"><a href="#para2-23" name="para2-23">2.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 18 August 1993, a Cabinet Office note on possible criminal offences on intrusion concluded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by noting that the aim remained to publish a White Paper in September of that year, following</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">a discussion at the first meeting of Cabinet after the summer break. However, the ambition of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publishing the White Paper in September was not fulfilled.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-24"><a href="#para2-24" name="para2-24">2.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In January 1994, Lord Wakeham met with the Lord Chancellor (Lord MacKay), Lord Brooke,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Home Secretary and a number of other senior politicians, to discuss the Calcutt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations. Lord Wakeham himself described this meeting as productive, and it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appears that a common view was reached on the proposed criminal offences. By 8 February</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1994, Lord Brooke was proposing to circulate a draft of the White Paper which recommended</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the introduction of the new criminal offences. This draft of the White Paper was sent to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prime Minister on 3 March.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref68" name="footnote68" title="Go back to footnote reference 68 in the text">68</a>.  HC Hansard, 14 January 1993, Col 1067</p><!--footnote-->

<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 7 March 1994, No 10 wrote to Lord Brooke asking for some further time to consider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the White Paper, and on 31 March 1994 wrote again, asking him to recast the draft White</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Paper. The new draft was to make the case for the new criminal offences whilst balancing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it with the arguments against; acknowledging the need for wide defence provisions against</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal offences but also the disadvantages of the offences with such defences included.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This intervention marked a turning point in the history of the response to the recommended</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal offences.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-26"><a href="#para2-26" name="para2-26">2.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The new draft White Paper was produced on 30 June 1994.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref70" href="#footnote70">70</a></sup> The Chancellor of the Exchequer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expressed some disappointment that there had been a retreat on the idea of new criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">offences.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-27"><a href="#para2-27" name="para2-27">2.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By the time of Lord Brooke&#8217;s departure on 20 July 1994, it was clear that the Government&#8216;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">support for Sir David Calcutt&#8217;s recommendation for new criminal offences to be introduced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was beginning to wane. Indeed, as will be seen, no new criminal offences were in fact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">introduced.</span>
<h4>Strand 3: civil offences</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-28"><a href="#para2-28" name="para2-28">2.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As referred to above, on 29 July 1993, the Lord Chancellor&#8217;s Department, in conjunction with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Scottish Office, published a consultation paper. This proposed the introduction of a civil</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">penalty for infringement of privacy. Lord Brooke told the Inquiry that the Lord Chancellor was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">known to be of the view that his proposed tort would render unnecessary any changes to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal law.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref71" href="#footnote71">71</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-29"><a href="#para2-29" name="para2-29">2.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In January 1994, the Lord Chancellor invited the Department of National Heritage to agree</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there should be a statutory remedy for infringements of privacy, arising from their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusions on the July consultation paper that the civil law should be put on a statutory</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">footing.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-30"><a href="#para2-30" name="para2-30">2.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 3 March 1994 Lord Brooke provided a draft White Paper to the Prime Minister on that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">basis. By the end of that month, the Prime Minister had asked him to redraft it. On the issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the new tort, the new draft was to say that, although a new tort was under consideration,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the inclusion by the PCC of like provisions within its own Code of Conduct would be even</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">better. Again, by the time that Lord Brooke left office, it was clear that the Government had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also retreated from this recommendation, preferring instead to encourage enhanced self-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-31"><a href="#para2-31" name="para2-31">2.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In July 1994, the Rt Hon Stephen Dorrell MP was appointed as Secretary of State for National</span>

<a name="page1251"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Government accepts the [Select] Committee&#8217;s analysis of the dilemma [posed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by the need for a balance between freedom of expression and privacy] and agrees</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that, at the stage when Sir David Calcutt and the Committee reported, the necessary</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">balance between these rights manifestly did not exist...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Since that time, however, the press has shown hopeful signs of greater self-restraint,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the PCC has improved its procedures and practices. There have been regrettable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">lapses by individual newspapers, and the Government is still to be convinced that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspaper industry, through the PCC, is fully in control of its members and we have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">entered a new era of wholly responsible journalism. But it considers that statutory</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">intervention at this stage would be out of proportion and possibly counter-productive.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Nonetheless the Government would urge the industry to consider further the self-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regulatory improvements set out in paragraphs 2.36 to 2.39 and in paragraph 4.19</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">... Failure to implement these changes, particularly if any such failure coincided with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">further press abuse, will incline the Government to introduce, or give support to any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Private Members&#8217; Bill introducing intrusion offences, a privacy tort, or both.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-32"><a href="#para2-32" name="para2-32">2.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In written evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Dorrell indicated that his first instinct upon taking office</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was to take some time to reassess the various options. He noted as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref74" href="#footnote74">74</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;(a) I am personally hostile to any proposal for official regulation of freedom of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expression;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) Quite apart from issues of principle, any proposal to regulate the activities of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press carries obvious political risks;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) I was reluctant to publish the draft White Paper which combined a theoretical</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">willingness to legislate (about which I was dubious) with practical unwillingness</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to do so (which I thought was unconvincing)<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref75" href="#footnote75">75</a></sup> ;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(d) I was conscious that there had been substantial debate before I took office</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">between senior members of government, some of whom were more sympathetic</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to a regulatory response than I was.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-33"><a href="#para2-33" name="para2-33">2.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his oral evidence Mr Dorrell was asked to elaborate why, in his view, the Government was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so keen to avoid replacing the PCC. His explanation was as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref76" href="#footnote76">76</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think it starts as an issue of principle ... it would be a step of considerable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">constitutional significance ... There was also, because this was a real political world</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with a real political set of decisions, there was the reality that if you were going to</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">even contemplate going down that road, you would encounter huge opposition from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the press themselves, based both on principle and it&#8217;s often argued on self-interest,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but it would be powerful, vigorous opposition, and that would, as a practical matter,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have made it impossible for such a proposal to have been carried through the House</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of Commons. So whether you address it as an issue of principle or reality, it wasn&#8217;t an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">option that merited very serious consideration&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Dorrell&#8217;s written evidence indicates that, as of November 1994, the imminent appointment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Lord Wakeham as Chair of the PCC prompted a dialogue with the PCC about the options for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">improving the self-regulatory structure, and that this dialogue continued into the early weeks</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of 1995. He described his objectives at that stage as being to develop the policy outlined in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the draft White Paper so that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref77" href="#footnote77">77</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) the Government could report that it had agreed improvements to the operations of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC which would justify its decision not to replace it; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) it could also report a clear conclusion &#8211; namely that it intended to proceed with its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commitment to legislate the proposed criminal intrusion offences, and that it did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intend to proceed with legislation to introduce a new tort of infringement of privacy.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-35"><a href="#para2-35" name="para2-35">2.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This policy position was summarised in a minute sent by Mr Dorrell to the Prime Minister on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2 March 1995.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref78" href="#footnote78">78</a></sup> This minute prompted responses from three Ministers, all of whom favoured</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proceeding with the policy position set out in the original draft White Paper.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-36"><a href="#para2-36" name="para2-36">2.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 20 March 1995, Mr Dorrell produced a further minute for the Prime Minister. This brought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a number of matters to his attention. In relation to the proposed tort of privacy, the minute</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">revealed a real concern about taking on the press, reading as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref79" href="#footnote79">79</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The tort would be the wrong thing at the wrong time. Most importantly, it would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mean a major row with the press (the Daily Mail editorial of 16 March, annex B, is a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">good indication of the strength of feeling). By contrast, the press has never been in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">serious doubt that the criminal offences would be enacted&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span> .</span>

<p id="para-id-2-37"><a href="#para2-37" name="para2-37">2.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The relevant Daily Mail editorial was headed &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Who</span><span style="font-style:italic"> are</span><span style="font-style:italic"> they</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> cry</span><span style="font-style:italic"> foul?</span> &#8221; and started with</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">corruption any concerted political clamour for privacy legislation is liable to be dismissed as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">little better than a self-protection racket<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref80" href="#footnote80">80</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-38"><a href="#para2-38" name="para2-38">2.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Dorrell was asked whether he was concerned about press coverage of this nature. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref81" href="#footnote81">81</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I was told early in my political life: any fool can have friends, it takes a wise man</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to have the right enemies. You have to pick which battles you&#8217;re going to fight. I&#8217;m</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not in favour of having government policy determined by press editorial, but nor</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">am I in favour, in the real world, of government policy being determined blind to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press editorial. You have to choose which arguments you&#8217;re going to have. One of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">elements of that choice is that there&#8217;s not much point in the government committing</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">itself to a course of action which, because of press hostility, it is profoundly unlikely to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">get through the House of Commons. That was in my judgment the position that would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have been in if we&#8217;d contemplated going down the route of introducing legation and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">privacy.</span>

<a name="page1253"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q: It seems that editorials from the more influential papers like the Daily Mail were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">certainly having an effect on your thinking?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: Of course. That&#8217;s part of the public discussion and I think it would be &#8211; for a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">politician to deny that the views of newspaper editorials are taking into account in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">policy making would be both implausible and actually wrong in principle.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">A third minute was produced by Mr Dorrell for the Prime Minister on 24 April 1995. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">minute referred to a request from the Prime Minister as to how the Government might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">present a &#8220;do nothing&#8221; option.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref82" href="#footnote82">82</a></sup> Mr Dorrell was asked about this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref83" href="#footnote83">83</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q: So can I take it from that that the Prime Minister was beginning to think in terms</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">of a &#8216;do nothing&#8217; option?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: I think it&#8217;s relatively hard to draw any other conclusion from this correspondence.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The government was arguing itself to a standstill, and therefore there had to be &#8211; it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was a reasonable question for him to ask. We had an obligation to reply to Calcutt.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We also had an obligation to reply to a Select Committee report, which this response</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was by then two years behind schedule, so we had to bring the matter to a conclusion</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">somehow.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-40"><a href="#para2-40" name="para2-40">2.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The third minute accordingly discussed the &#8220;do nothing&#8221; option. It explored how such a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision could be presented. The practical options appeared to be: first, making no statement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at all, second announcing that nothing was going to be done, or third making a statement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which (a) confirmed the intention to legislate the intrusion offences<span style="font-style:italic"> when</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Parliamentary</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">time permits<span style="font-style:normal"> (italics</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> original)</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> (b)</span><span style="font-style:normal"> asserted</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> preference</span><span style="font-style:normal"> for</span><span style="font-style:normal"> self-regulation</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wider field of privacy law but underlined that continued public confidence in this approach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">depended on the effectiveness of the PCC. When asked why the words &#8220;when Parliamentary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">time permits&#8221; was in italics, Mr Dorrell confirmed that this was because the real intention</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was in fact simply not to enact these provisions.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref84" href="#footnote84">84</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-41"><a href="#para2-41" name="para2-41">2.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Dorrell&#8217;s minute expressed the view that the final option was the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> least</span><span style="font-style:italic"> bad</span><span style="font-style:italic"> choice</span> &#8221; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that although it would &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> take</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> good</span><span style="font-style:italic"> deal</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> brazening</span><span style="font-style:italic"> out,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> given</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> history</span> &#8221;, it could not &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> be</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q: Can I suggest that this political debate and the consideration of the announcing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;do nothing&#8221; and the third option of saying that you&#8217;re going to legislate when</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Parliamentary time permits, is that an example of a phenomenon which has been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">referred to by Tony Blair of not being able to be entirely frank for fear of how matters</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">will be perceived?</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: I think that is a reasonable way of putting it, and I think it&#8217;s pretty explicit in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">minute. I was asked to dress up a &#8216;do nothing&#8217; option. One way of doing nothing is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to announce that you&#8217;re going to do nothing, and I made it clear in the minute why,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as a member of the government, that didn&#8217;t seem to me to be an attractive way of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">announcing it, but clearly the option (c) amounts to the same thing.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q: Indeed it wasn&#8217;t your preferred way forward, but a variation of the &#8216;do nothing&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">option was in fact what happened, wasn&#8217;t it?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">A: Substantively, yes&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Committee meeting which was held on 15 June 1995. This set out Mr Dorrell&#8217;s preferred</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">option, namely to legislate on the criminal offences but not the tort, and it encouraged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC to raise its game; but noted that the Government had no plans to replace it. No</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear consensus appears to have been reached at that meeting, and Mr Dorrell explained in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence that Ministers had differing views on the appropriate way forward.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref86" href="#footnote86">86</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-43"><a href="#para2-43" name="para2-43">2.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of discussions took place thereafter between No 10 and the Department of National</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Heritage, but matters were interrupted by the Prime Minister&#8217;s decision to resign his position</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as Leader of the Conservative Party on 22 June 1995. Following Sir John Major&#8217;s re-election,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Dorrell moved to the Department of Health.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-44"><a href="#para2-44" name="para2-44">2.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Dorrell was asked whether he considered that the Government&#8217;s response to Sir David&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">second report had been a missed opportunity. Unlike Sir John Major, he did not think so:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref87" href="#footnote87">87</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;My basic response to that is no I don&#8217;t. First of all, at a purely mechanistic level,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the ability to do anything fundamental in legislative terms I don&#8217;t think was there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">because, as I have already said, I don&#8217;t think in reality we&#8217;d have been able to carry</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">legislation, so there was no opportunity, if that&#8217;s what you wanted to do. But ... I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">am not persuaded that if we go down the legislative route here we don&#8217;t create a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">problem, a cure that&#8217;s worse than the disease&#8221;.</span>

<h3>Virginia Bottomley MP</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-45"><a href="#para2-45" name="para2-45">2.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The results of the discussions referred to above were the White Paper, published on 17 July</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1995, some two and a half years after the publication of Sir David&#8217;s second report. The Rt Hon</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Virginia Bottomley MP, now Baroness Bottomley, as the new Secretary of State for National</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Heritage, was responsible for its publication. The key points of the White Paper were as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref88" href="#footnote88">88</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;(a) The Government does not find the case for statutory measures in this area</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">compelling. It believes that, in principle, industry self-regulation is much to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">preferred.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) The Government has long recognised that there is, in principle, a case for the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">introduction of [new physical intrusion] offences ... The Government has however</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">so far been unable to construct legislation which in practice would be sufficiently</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">workable to be responsibly brought to the statute book.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) In considering the results of the consultation [on the feasibility of introducing a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">new tort of the infringement of privacy] the Government draws two conclusions.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">First it does not believe there is sufficient public consensus on which to base</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">statutory intervention in this area. Secondly it strongly prefers the principle of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">self-regulation ... It therefore has no present intention to legislate a new civil</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">remedy&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-46"><a href="#para2-46" name="para2-46">2.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In summary, the PCC was to remain, and there was to be no new tort and no new criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">offences.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Baroness Bottomley summarised the position she inherited as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref89" href="#footnote89">89</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Taking over in July 1995, I had little direct knowledge of the conditions prior to Sir</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">David&#8217;s report. There was confidence that John Wakeham, as Chairman of the PCC,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was the man for the moment and would lead self regulation in an authoritative</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">manner with, if necessary, greater menace than before&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-48"><a href="#para2-48" name="para2-48">2.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">She therefore moved forward with the response to Calcutt largely as it had been prepared</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under her predecessor. She announced to Parliament that the Government would &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> for</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the present allow Lord Wakeham&#8217;s commission, and the press, to demonstrate that self-</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">creation of a compensation fund from which the PCC would compensate those whose privacy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been violated by the press and a number of changes to the Code to place greater weight</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the protection of individual privacy.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref92" href="#footnote92">92</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-49"><a href="#para2-49" name="para2-49">2.49</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This was a complete victory for Lord Wakeham and the press, delivered through negotiation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the Government in relation to the improvements that could be delivered through</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">self-regulation. Baroness Bottomley appeared to consider that the Government and Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Wakeham had an understanding and she presumed it would be honoured on both sides. She</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> satisfied</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Lord</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Wakeham,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> who</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> trifled</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> had</span><span style="font-style:italic"> got</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> measure</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the role. There were lists of improved reforms and mechanisms.<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref93" href="#footnote93">93</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-50"><a href="#para2-50" name="para2-50">2.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This was demonstrated, for example, in February 1996, when a Private Member&#8217;s Bill on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protection of privacy was brought forward, Baroness Bottomley was keen to honour that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">agreement. In a letter to the Lord President of the Council she said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref94" href="#footnote94">94</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;More importantly, the Bill would cut across our policy on press regulation. It would be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">strongly resisted by the media, and would undermine the position of John Wakeham,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whose authority as chairman of the Press Complaints Commission is predicated on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Government&#8217;s assurance that it will not introduce legislation provided that he</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">can make self-regulation work. For this reason alone, I think that the Bill should be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">blocked at Second reading.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-51"><a href="#para2-51" name="para2-51">2.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By the end of 1996, it was becoming clear that the PCC and the press had not delivered on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all that the Government had asked, and expected, of it in 1995. An internal Department of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Heritage review of press self-regulation for the Secretary of State concluded that<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref95" href="#footnote95">95</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;in certain crucial respects, and as shown by a series of unremedied press abuses, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">weaknesses of self-regulation identified by the first review (covering July 1995-April</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">1996) have not been addressed, largely because the industry and Commission have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not implemented various recommendations which you [Mrs Bottomley] made&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Department of Heritage note recorded agreement with Baroness Bottomley that she</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should write to Lord Wakeham to seek assurances that there would be action on breaches</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">without a complaint, as well as incorporation of guidance on the public interest. This note</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">shines a very interesting light on the relationship that had hitherto existed between Baroness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Bottomley and Lord Wakeham. Baroness Bottomley was warned that seeking assurances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from Lord Wakeham which he was known not to be willing to give would be a distinct change</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of approach:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref96" href="#footnote96">96</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;You should note that this will be a change of approach to the Press Complaints</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">1 above) were agreed in draft by the recipient before they were sent, so that, for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">example, your letters to Lord Wakeham tended to be limited to recommendations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which he personally favoured, which he thought the industry would accept, or which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he felt he could reject or defer in a plausible way. Equally, we could ensure that his</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">letters to you were less evasive than they might otherwise have been. I think that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">difficulty with this method is that your letters push mostly at open doors, whereas it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is the closed ones on which he has not been very forthcoming and which are at the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">root of the present failures of self-regulation.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-53"><a href="#para2-53" name="para2-53">2.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It has not been possible to follow these policy developments from start to finish, but the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence presented demonstrates first, that the 1995 Government response to Sir David</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Calcutt&#8217;s report was developed on the basis of an understanding between the Government</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Lord Wakeham (clearly acting on behalf of the press), and second, the limited extent to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which even that understanding, so wholly in favour of the industry, was ultimately delivered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the industry or the PCC.</span>

<h3>Lord Wakeham</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-54"><a href="#para2-54" name="para2-54">2.54</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Wakeham said in evidence that he was appointed as a fixer, a man tasked with restoring</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the reputation of the PCC with leading figures within Government and of convincing the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the effectiveness of the PCC.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref97" href="#footnote97">97</a></sup> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lord Wakeham summarised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the thinking of the industry in relation to his appointment in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref98" href="#footnote98">98</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think the newspaper industry did not want statutory control and that they accepted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they needed someone to be the chairman with a bit of clout, who could stop statutory</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">control by getting the standards up to an acceptable level, and this was my view of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what I thought they probably wanted.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think if you wanted someone who could guide the PCC to a better code of behaviour,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it would have been difficult at the time to find anyone better than John Wakeham or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more capable of being able to do it. Certainly he made some efforts to do it, but I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think at the end John would concede there was more perhaps needed to be done than</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he was able to do. But it was perfectly credible to believe that he would achieve more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">than almost anyone in doing it.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir John also made clear the political impact of Lord Wakeham&#8217;s appointment (as well as the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intelligence of the industry decision) in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref100" href="#footnote100">100</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I mean, those who were at all queasy about it would then say, &#8220;Look, here is one</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of our own, a very respected former Cabinet Minister who is actually chairing the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">PCC. Therefore, why don&#8217;t we wait and see how well he gets on? Why rush ahead</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with legislation?&#8221; So his appointment did have a material effect upon views in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Parliamentary party.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-57"><a href="#para2-57" name="para2-57">2.57</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Smith of Finsbury, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport between 1997 and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2001, noted that the appointment of Lord Wakeham as Chair of the PCC represented a sea</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">change in that organisation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref101" href="#footnote101">101</a></sup> He explained that Lord Wakeham moved to look seriously at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">how the powers of the PCC might be strengthened, stating that this was the first time that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC had demonstrated a preparedness to make real change. This, he suggested, led policy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">makers to be sufficiently impressed to remove the threat of concerted political action.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref102" href="#footnote102">102</a></sup> This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he asserts:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref103" href="#footnote103">103</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;effectively ensure[d] that the Calcutt proposal for statutory intervention did not have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">political legs.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-58"><a href="#para2-58" name="para2-58">2.58</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Certainly, Lord Smith gave evidence that on his assumption to office, press reform was no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">longer an issue accorded any priority.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref104" href="#footnote104">104</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">It may be argued that this was the purpose of Lord Wakeham&#8217;s appointment; in the words</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Lord Smith, to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> draw</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> sting</span> &#8221; of political pressure for greater and more far-reaching</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reforms. Lord Wakeham was regarded as an able political operator and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> outstandingly</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">skilful<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> his</span><span style="font-style:normal"> efforts</span><span style="font-style:normal"> at</span><span style="font-style:normal"> reforming</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> PCC.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref105" href="#footnote105">105</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-60"><a href="#para2-60" name="para2-60">2.60</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The purpose of his appointment, however, has been open to question. On the one hand, it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argued that it was to make use of his finely tuned political antennae to deliver the minimum</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reform necessary to placate the proponents of greater press reform and preserve as much of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the industry influence and control of the system of press self- regulation as possible. On the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other hand, it is contended that this was a genuine attempt at reform, that ultimately though</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">well intended fell short of delivering real and effective change. The third possibility is that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Wakeham&#8217;s tenure as Chair of the PCC fell somewhere between those two stools.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-61"><a href="#para2-61" name="para2-61">2.61</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The role of Lord Wakeham is altogether more complex and nuanced than as the fixer he claims</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">himself to be. He was also appointed as Chair to make certain that the PCC was satisfactory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the industry it sought to regulate. As the Report has noted, Lord Wakeham gave evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he was a strong supporter of both press freedom and self-regulation:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref106" href="#footnote106">106</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you could be a chairman of a body that was running a system of self-</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regulation unless you believed in self-regulation. I think that would be a bit difficult.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">And I can&#8217;t imagine you being a very good chairman of a Press Council if you didn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">believe in press freedom. I would have thought they were pretty self-evidently things</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that were required for the job.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The key to Lord Wakeham&#8217;s success was that he provided the Government with a solution</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to what had increasingly become an intractable problem. By the time Mr Dorrell became</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State, the Government may have privately abandoned proposals to implement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the recommendations of Sir David Calcutt&#8217;s second report. It seemed to those in Government,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including Mr Dorrell, that the most effective way forward was through reform of the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">itself. Lord Wakeham had the personality, status and apparent willingness to take that reform</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">forward to the satisfaction of Government.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref107" href="#footnote107">107</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-63"><a href="#para2-63" name="para2-63">2.63</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is testament to the political skills of Lord Wakeham that, in this particular context, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC emerged as a potential solution to the issue of privacy.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref108" href="#footnote108">108</a></sup> Additionally, it was fortuitous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for Government that Lord Wakeham moved quickly to introduce reforms to make the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC more credible. These included, for example, the strengthening of the position of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Privacy Commissioner, and the appointment of men of stature to key positions within that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisation, about which Lord Wakeham said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref109" href="#footnote109">109</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, I suppose this is the flipside of me being appointed as the chairman. I mean,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">things were changing and here it seemed to me that it was important to try and get</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Press Complaints Commission more highly respected and therefore to get the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">right people and have the right people appointing them seemed to me to be a move</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">in the right direction.&#8217;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-64"><a href="#para2-64" name="para2-64">2.64</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By the time that Baroness Bottomley took over as Secretary of State, it is clear that Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Wakeham was successfully influencing Government policy, very much to the advantage of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC and the press without distinction between the two.</span>

<h3>Sir John Major</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-65"><a href="#para2-65" name="para2-65">2.65</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first Calcutt report was published a few months before Sir John Major became Prime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Minister, but the second report was published in January 1993 when he had been in that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">position for a number of years and had, of course, been returned to power following his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">election victory in April 1992. Asked about his direct role in responding to Sir David&#8217;s second</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">report, he said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref110" href="#footnote110">110</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t acquire direct ownership of the issue, certainly not. It was one of 20</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or 30 &#8211; there are 30 to 40 issues a day that cross a Prime Minister&#8217;s desk. The fact</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the matter is that he or she can almost never have direct ownership of an issue. It</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">has to be sub-contracted to the appropriate Secretary of State and the appropriate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Cabinet committee and that is what happened with the Calcutt Report ... The day-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to-day detail of examination, of what is a very complex matter ... was predominantly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the hands of the Secretary of State, although when things were snarled up, they</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were reported back to me and I became sucked in, in terms of expressing an opinion</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and inviting people to go back and look at something again or recognising that it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">wouldn&#8217;t work&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir John was asked in evidence about the three &#8216;strands&#8217; to the Calcutt recommendations. As</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the recommendation for an independent tribunal, he noted:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref111" href="#footnote111">111</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The grounds of principle we had in mind was the freedom of the press to comment.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">That was why we regarded the idea of a statutory tribunal as very much as a last</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">resort and something that we were not at the time attracted to.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-67"><a href="#para2-67" name="para2-67">2.67</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As to the proposed privacy tort, he noted:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref112" href="#footnote112">112</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There were several difficulties with the tort of privacy. One of the difficulties was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that it was very easy to portray a tort of privacy as being a piece of legislation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that favoured people who were relatively well off and relatively well organised but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">without complete access to legal aid for everyone would not be available to be used</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by the vast majority of people ... The other point about the tort of privacy was that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it became apparent in the deliberations of the Cabinet subcommittee was that there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was a very substantial philosophical difference within the Conservative Party, within</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ministers, as to the desirability of a tort of privacy.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Some thought it would be very difficult to frame and might only be unfairly framed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and that would be unfair on the media. Others thought it would provoke such hostility</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that it would dwarf everything else that the government were doing. To that extent,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">some of them were very wary. Others were simply philosophically unsure that it was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the right time and right place to actually go down that route.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There was a universality of opinion across the press that the tort in particular would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be very damaging to investigative journalism. That was their view and they expressed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it very forcibly in the columns of their newspapers ... It was a universality of opposition</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that we thought would spill out beyond opposition to that into opposition on wider</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">areas of policy as well. The government would, in effect, become tainted. I think some</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">colleagues felt that and there would be a general opposition to what the government</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were doing and not just an opposition focussed on that particular piece of legislation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and that particular provision.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref113" href="#footnote113">113</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-68"><a href="#para2-68" name="para2-68">2.68</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As to the proposed criminal offences:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref114" href="#footnote114">114</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I asked the then Secretary of State why he felt that the press weren&#8217;t very concerned</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about the criminal clauses and he said that was what they had told him in discussion.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I don&#8217;t suggest that they were enthusiastic; I suggest that there wasn&#8217;t a last-ditch</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">determination by the media to have fought against that&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-69"><a href="#para2-69" name="para2-69">2.69</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Asked why, in general terms, the Government had been unable to implement any of the main</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Calcutt recommendations, he said as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref115" href="#footnote115">115</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The principal reason, at the end of the day &#8211; not the only reason, but the principal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reason, at the end of the day, why we were unable to enact Calcutt is that we could</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not have got it through the House of Commons. If you cannot get something through</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the House of Commons, you are powerless. That is the difference between &#8211; a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">government with a large majority can force something through. A government with a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">small majority &#8211; and in the 1990s we had a small majority to start with and it shrank</span>

<p id="para-id-2-70"><a href="#para2-70" name="para2-70">2.70</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He also noted that the appointment of Lord Wakeham as Chairman of the PCC had also had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a significant effect:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref116" href="#footnote116">116</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It would have been difficult at the time to find anyone better than John Wakeham</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or more capable of being able to do it ... I mean, those who were at all queasy about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">[statutory regulation] would then say: &#8216;Look, here is one of our own, a very respected</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">formerCabinet ministerwhois actually chairing thePCC. Therefore,why don&#8217;twewait</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and see how well he gets on? Why rush ahead with legislation?&#8217; So his appointment</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">did have a material effect upon views in the Parliamentary party&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-71"><a href="#para2-71" name="para2-71">2.71</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Asked about the &#8216;do nothing&#8217; option contained in the minute of 24 April 1995, Sir John gave</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence as to why Mr Dorrell was asked to explore this option, and why it was the option</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">eventually chosen:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref117" href="#footnote117">117</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t carry anything through Parliament, and at the time, I think we had a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">majority of &#8211; I think our majority had fallen to single figures by then. So we were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">talking about a majority of nine and arguably the most contentious piece of legislation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that anyone could have seen for quite a long time.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-72"><a href="#para2-72" name="para2-72">2.72</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his written evidence, Sir John expressed the view that the failure to implement any of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Calcutt review recommendations was a &#8216;missed opportunity&#8217;. Asked to elaborate on this in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">oral evidence, he said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref118" href="#footnote118">118</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, I do. I do feel that. I think many of the things that have happened subsequently</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that have led to this Inquiry may not have happened if we had been able to enact,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and I think in the interest if the good majority of the press, the press wouldn&#8217;t have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fallen into the disrepute in which the criminal activities have laid it. If these changes</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had been made, I don&#8217;t think many of the things that subsequently happened would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have happened. So in that sense it was a missed opportunity. But it was a missed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">opportunity which was unavoidable. It wasn&#8217;t a missed opportunity because we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">shirked it. It was a missed opportunity because we couldn&#8217;t do it&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span></span>

<h3>Reflections</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-73"><a href="#para2-73" name="para2-73">2.73</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The triumph of the &#8216;do nothing option&#8217; demonstrates the way in which the press and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians have worked together on questions of media policy. In this case, the context was of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a reactive policy: both the Government and the industry leaders were responding to external</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">events.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-74"><a href="#para2-74" name="para2-74">2.74</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, doing nothing is both recognisable and perfectly legitimate in very many areas of policy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and politics; there are many competing demands on the political agenda and public concern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about press standards was, in a pre-internet age, afforded little publicity. Doing anything,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particularly in this area, is always more difficult. Second, the press objected to the proposals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both vociferously and comprehensively, deploying the megaphone at full volume. Third, they</span>

<h2>3. Human Rights Act 1998</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Long Title of the Human Rights Act 1998 (the HRA) states that it is designed to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> give</span><span style="font-style:italic"> further</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">effect to rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the preface to the White Paper &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Rights</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Brought</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Home</span> &#8221;, the Prime Minister explained that</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A great deal has been written about the HRA, the debates in Parliament when the Bill was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being passed, and precisely what it was intended to achieve. No such exercise is required in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this context. This section of the Report seeks solely to ascertain the concerns of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">during the passage of the Bill through Parliament, and to set out the basis on which any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">amendments and concessions were made following lobbying efforts carried out directly or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on their behalf.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is clear that the initial publication of the Human Rights Bill by the incoming Labour</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government led to substantial concerns being expressed by most sections of the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, there was a general concern about a &#8220;judge-made&#8221; privacy law which the Human Rights</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Act in general might lead to. Initially at least, the press argued that in order to avoid this, they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be excluded from the ambit of the Human Rights Act entirely.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, but linked to the general concern, a number of specific concerns were expressed,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in particular about pre-action restraint in privacy cases. Representations were made to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the effect that pre-trial injunctions should be granted in privacy cases in only the most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exceptional of circumstances. The press argued that in general terms the Bill should ensure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that complainants make full use of the PCC rather than the courts.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As a result, what followed was sustained lobbying, and then detailed negotiations between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">government and Lord Wakeham, Chair of the PCC at that time. In summary, although the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government took the view that the press should not be excluded from the ambit of the HRA,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these negotiations led to the enactment of section 12. This provides as follows:</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(1) This section applies if a court is considering whether to grant any relief which,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">if granted, might affect the exercise of the Convention right to freedom of</span>

<h3>The Role of Lord Wakeham</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Wakeham, who had been a Conservative member of the House of Lords since 1992,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref120" href="#footnote120">120</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">became Chair of the PCC in January 1995. Given his background, and his commitment to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the principles of self-regulation and freedom of the press, it would be surprising if he did</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not have strong personal views about the Human Rights Bill. In the event, he led support of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the case the press was advancing with enthusiasm and effectiveness. Questions arise as to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether in doing so he was speaking on behalf of the PCC (as its Chair), the press as a whole,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">or both. On that point, Lord Wakeham said this in his evidence to the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref121" href="#footnote121">121</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I must make it clear that throughout the discussions on the Bill, I never acted as a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;representative of thepress&#8217;. My concern was always with thefutureof self-regulation,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the way in which the human rights legislation might undermine it.&#8221;</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref120" name="footnote120" title="Go back to footnote reference 120 in the text">120</a>.  he was Secretary of State for Energy between 1989 and 1992, and Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lordsbetween 1992 and 1994</p><!--footnote-->

<a name="page1263"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Asked about this in oral evidence, Lord Wakeham expanded as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref122" href="#footnote122">122</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q: Some commentators have said that it is simply inappropriate for the chairman</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the regulator, who&#8217;s meant to be, at the end of the day, an impartial mediator</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and complaints handler, to essentially lobby on behalf of the press in respect of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">government decisions that might affect the press&#8217; commercial interests ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: I was never a regulator. I never said I was a regulator. I didn&#8217;t pretend to be a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regulator. My task was to try and raise standards in the press by means of a code and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by self-regulation. You have to bear in mind that when I went there, the press had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been governed previously by the Press Council, and there ... wasn&#8217;t a code. We were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the starting of the code. It was pretty crude when we started, and we refined it, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at no time was it a regulator&#8217;s job. It was a job of raising standards in self-regulation.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q: Did you speak to the press industry when the human rights bill was going through</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Parliament? Did you speak to representatives of the press industry?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: Ican&#8217;trememberdoingso.Ican&#8217;tabsolutelyswearthatIneverspoketoajournalist</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at any time about it, but I certainly wasn&#8217;t representing them. My concern was for the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public. The Press Complaints Commission, in my view, was the best way of protecting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the public and I didn&#8217;t want to see it destroyed in the way that it more or less has been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the last few years.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whether or not the PCC was a regulator in the full sense of that term, a question arises about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">how far Lord Wakeham as the Chair of the self-regulatory body charged with the responsibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for resolving press complaints should have been speaking out in support of the case which the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press clearly espoused. He would doubtless have been aware of the position the press was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taking on these issues regardless of whether he discussed them with journalists and editors.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In any event, the connection between the role of the PCC in maintaining press standards and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opposing the Human Rights Bill insofar as it related to the press is not immediately apparent.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-10"><a href="#para3-10" name="para3-10">3.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Other witnesses disagreed with Lord Wakeham&#8217;s recollection. Asked about a debate in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">House of Commons during the second reading of the Bill, the Rt Hon Jack Straw MP gave</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence to the Inquiry as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref123" href="#footnote123">123</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q: Then ... you make it clear that there were discussions which involved you, the late</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Lord Williams and Lord Wakeham ... &#8220;The new clause was drafted in consultation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with Lord Wakeham and representatives of the national and regional press. They</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have given it a warm welcome.&#8221; So the upshot is that part of the explanation for the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">genesis of section 12, a consultation, agreement if you like, which you reach with Lord</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Wakeham, who may well have been speaking for a large section of the press. Is that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">fair?</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: Yes. He was certainly speaking for a large section of the press. Whatever his</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">position in the House of Lords, he was chairman of the Press Complaints Commission</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">... I mean, it wasn&#8217;t a piece of private enterprise by Lord Wakeham. There would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have been no purpose served in busy ministers spending their time speaking to Lord</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Wakeham if this was just a sort of personal foible. He had a very influential position</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and he was tending to speak on behalf of the press ... I worked on the basis that if I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could square Lord Wakeham, I&#8217;d square most sections of the press, which is what I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wanted to do&#8221;.</span>

<a name="page1264"></a><!--new page--><h3>Concerns of the press and lobbying</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-11"><a href="#para3-11" name="para3-11">3.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In any event, regardless of whether he formally represented the interests and concerns of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press, it is clear that Lord Wakeham played a central role in advancing the arguments</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which the press would have wished to raise. On 12 January 1998 Lord Wakeham wrote to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Smith,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref124" href="#footnote124">124</a></sup> the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, expounding his principal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns about the Bill:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref125" href="#footnote125">125</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;... there are two central problems with the Bill. The first is the issue of prior restraint</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; and the new arsenal of weapons that will be available to the rich, the corrupt and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">those comfortable with the courts to gag newspapers. The second is whether the PCC</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should be a public authority within the terms of the Bill &#8211; and therefore the sort of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">legal entity which the newspaper industry never intended it to be&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-12"><a href="#para3-12" name="para3-12">3.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The issue of &#8216;prior restraint&#8217; is explained below: in fact, it came to the fore slightly later in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">chronological sequence. The second issue is technical, but may be boiled down to this. If the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC was a public authority within the meaning of what is now section 6 of the HRA, then it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be unlawful for it to act incompatibly with any human right. It was believed, or feared,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the time &#8211; depending on one&#8217;s point of view &#8211; that the effect of incorporating Article 8 of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Convention into domestic law would be to create a privacy law &#8216;by the back door&#8217;. Subject</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the application of section 6, the PCC would become bound to apply it.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-13"><a href="#para3-13" name="para3-13">3.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Wakeham made two speeches in the House of Lords during the Committee stage and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Third Reading of the Human Rights Bill. In written evidence, he explained that his view</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref126" href="#footnote126">126</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Bill as drafted would damage the freedom of the press and badly wound the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">system of tough and effective self regulation that we have built up to provide quick</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">remedies without cost for ordinary citizens. It would inevitably produce a privacy law,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">despite the Government&#8217;s stated opposition to one&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-14"><a href="#para3-14" name="para3-14">3.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Initially, the press through Lord Wakeham tried to obtain a complete exemption from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">HRA. Lord Wakeham accepted this in oral evidence, also noting that he did not expect that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this would be considered acceptable:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref127" href="#footnote127">127</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q: Did you initially seek to get the press a complete exemption from the provisions</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the Human Rights Act?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: I certainly did, with absolutely no chance whatsoever of getting it through the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">House of Lords, but I wanted to raise the issue, which was important. I have to tell you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that Parliament is in favour of strengthening restraints on the press whenever they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">find an opportunity, and if there&#8217;s any legislation flows from the circumstances we&#8217;re</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in, I have considerable reservations as how it would get on in Parliament.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In oral evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Straw explained why Lord Wakeham&#8217;s assessment that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic"> absolutely</span><span style="font-style:italic"> no</span><span style="font-style:italic"> chance</span><span style="font-style:italic"> whatsoever</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> getting</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> through</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> House</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Lords</span> &#8217; was correct:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref128" href="#footnote128">128</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;... Lord Wakeham went on to say that there was a second issue, which he described</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as far more serious, which was whether the PCC should be a public authority within</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the terms of the bill. In fact, the PCC was not a public authority within the terms of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Bill, but what the PCC were trying to secure was a situation where the media were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">outwith the impact of the Bill so you just drew a ring around them somehow and they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be excluded from any adjudication on the conflict between Article 8 and Article 10</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or anything else. Now, that was just impossible to meet, and I had to explain that to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">them, and we didn&#8217;t meet it.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It&#8217;s also simply incorrect for anyone now to say that nobody knew that a Human</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Rights Act would lead to a law of privacy. Of course they did. They said so. But as I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">brought out in my Gareth Williams lecture, we all knew it was going to do that. That</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was discussed endlessly in Parliament.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-16"><a href="#para3-16" name="para3-16">3.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I now turn to the issue of &#8216;prior restraint&#8217;, in relation to which Lord Wakeham also made strong</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">representations. What this issue amounted to concerned the legal test the High Court should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apply in granting without notice injunctions in privacy cases: in essence, Lord Wakeham&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contention was that it should be more difficult for privacy claimants to obtain such injunctions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than would ordinarily be the case because the right to freedom of expression would always</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be in play.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref129" href="#footnote129">129</a></sup> Here, it is fair to point out that the reasons he advanced back in 1998 were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">broadly similar to the reasons he gave to the Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions in</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">2011:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref130" href="#footnote130">130</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;My concern was to stop privacy cases by and large coming to the courts at all. I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wanted people who felt they were done down by the press to go to something less</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">than court. You only have to look in the papers the other day; it cost a footballer half</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a million pounds to bring a privacy action, which he lost. That is of no use to the vast</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">majority of my old constituents ... I wanted section 12 to try to encourage the use</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the Press Complaints Commission and therefore people would not come to court</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nearly as much so we could deal with it....&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-17"><a href="#para3-17" name="para3-17">3.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On this issue Lord Wakeham received a sympathetic ear from Government. The Inquiry heard</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence that extensive negotiations took place between Lord Wakeham, Lord Smith and Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Straw who was then the Home Secretary. Mr Straw explained in oral evidence to the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">why he took the view that these negotiations were both necessary and appropriate:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref131" href="#footnote131">131</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I was very anxious to achieve a consensus on this legislation because I have a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">principle which is that major constitutional change should only go through if there is</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">some kind of greater legitimacy, either through a consensus in Parliament or through</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a referendum, and the Conservatives were opposing the bill at second reading and I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was anxious to see whether we could reach an accommodation so we could get their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">endorsement to it. Also I thought a part of what Lord Wakeham and the PCC were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">saying was reasonable. [On the issue of prior restraint] ... I thought they had a point</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">there&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">concerned, for news is a perishable commodity and to delay its publication, even for a short</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">period, may well deprive it of all its value and interest<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Straw</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> light</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this principle, the Government believed that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref134" href="#footnote134">134</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The courts should consider the merits of an application when it is made and should</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not grant an interim injunction simply to preserve the status quo ante between the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">parties&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-19"><a href="#para3-19" name="para3-19">3.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Wakeham gave evidence as to precisely how section 12 of the HRA came about, including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the nature of his involvement in its genesis. In written evidence, he explained as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref135" href="#footnote135">135</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;... I believe Jack Straw understood ... [my views] more clearly ... When the Bill moved</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from the Lords to the Commons in the spring of 1998, he moved swiftly to try to deal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with some of the issues that were raised and what became Section 12 was the result.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Jack worked closely with me on the wording of the amendment, and we eventually</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">agreed it at a hastily arranged meeting at Heathrow Airport.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I believe Section 12 was the best compromise that was likely to have been achieved</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the circumstances. It tried to tackle the issue of prior restraint and in Jack Straw&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">phrase in the House of Commons, &#8216;preserve self regulation&#8217;. But it has &#8211; as the recent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rows over super-injunctions have shown &#8211; only been partially successful.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-20"><a href="#para3-20" name="para3-20">3.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence of Lord Wakeham and Mr Straw therefore appears to be consistent. Mr Straw</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also accepted that the Government agreed to the inclusion of section 12 having regard to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns of the press. On 2 July 1998 the Bill had reached its second reading in the House of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commons. Mr Straw was asked at the Inquiry about a debate which took place on that day:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref136" href="#footnote136">136</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q: You were debating what was then clause 13, which became section 12, and ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you told the Commons: &#8220;As the Committee will know, there was concern in some</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sections of the press that the bill might undermine press freedom and result in a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">privacy law by the back door.&#8221; And then you say that was not the government&#8217;s view</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and you&#8217;ve dealt with the issue.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A: Yes.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">Q: Butontheissueofpriorrestraintandwhatbecamesection12,thethirdparagraph,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you say: &#8220;We recognise the concerns expressed in the press. As I have made clear,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for example in respect of the bill&#8217;s impact on the churches, we are anxious to deal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">constructively with them. In the light of those concerns we decided to introduce a</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">new clause specifically designed to safeguard press freedom. We thought long and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hard about it...&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A: Yes.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Even so, it would be going too far to conclude that the Government introduced what became</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">section 12 on account of the concerns of the press and for no other reason. Taking Mr Straw&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence as a whole, he made it clear that there were other reasons for &#8216;raising the bar&#8217; in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to the grant of without notice interim injunctions. Press concerns may have been a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">factor to which the Government had regard, and there may have been a form of compromise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as to the precise wording of the provision; this appears to have been a case in which the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thrust of overall Government policy and the interests of the press came into alignment.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-22"><a href="#para3-22" name="para3-22">3.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I do not overlook the evidence of Mr Blair who placed a somewhat different interpretation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of these events:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref137" href="#footnote137">137</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Was it the position that News International &#8211; I suppose together with everybody</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">else &#8211; were lobbying for complete press immunity from the Human Rights Act?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes, that&#8217;s right. They wanted no suggestion that you would move outside the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bounds of the PCC and self-regulation.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. And were you generally supportive of that position?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes, that was &#8211; I mean, my &#8211; my view was that if you were to deal with this, you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had to deal with it head on, as it were, not through the Human Rights Act, which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would be a sort of side way of dealing with it. Also, at that time, I think I&#8217;m right in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">saying it was Lord Wakeham who was head of the PCC, who was something actually</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I thought was doing quite a good job of that, and the PCC were pretty fierce on this,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on behalf the whole of the media, really, not any one particular part of it.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Was the position reached that following, if I can put it in these terms, pressure</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from Lord Irvine &#8211; of course then your Lord Chancellor, who I think was responsible for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">piloting the act through Parliament generally, certainly of course through the Lords</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; that he persuaded you that your position was incorrect and we ended up with a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">compromise, which we see in the form of Section 12 of the Act?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">A. That&#8217;s right.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. In terms, though, of what your position was, what was the problem in allowing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a privacy law to develop incrementally through Article 8, which is what would have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">happened &#8211; indeed has happened in any event &#8211; with the introduction of the Act in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the form in which we now see it?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. As I say, I felt we should still be with the self-regulation argument, and I knew</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that we were going to have quite a big battle over it if we changed that position. In</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the end, we did come to a compromise, and I think that compromise was perfectly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sensible, by the way.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-23"><a href="#para3-23" name="para3-23">3.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I can quite understand how from Mr Blair&#8217;s perspective, section 12 appeared to be a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compromise; he after all was supportive of the press case for complete exemption from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scope of the HRA. But the evidence of Lord Wakeham and Mr Straw clearly demonstrates</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that complete immunity was unrealistic and unacceptable, not least from the point of view</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of public opinion.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-24"><a href="#para3-24" name="para3-24">3.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of academic commentators have taken the view that the press concerns about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the application of the HRA and any satisfaction they may have gained from section 12 were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">misplaced. They argue that irrespective of the HRA, judges were already developing the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">common law of breach of confidence to protect privacy. They also argue that the Government</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not intend by section 12 to include any provision which required the courts to do more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than apply the principles set out in the Convention, and that it would have been pointless to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attempt to do so in any event, as the UK&#8217;s international obligations would permit persons who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">took the view that domestic law inadequately protects their rights to bring a claim against the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">UK in the European Court of Human Rights.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref138" href="#footnote138">138</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-25"><a href="#para3-25" name="para3-25">3.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, evidence given to the Inquiry by a number of media lawyers was to the effect that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the procedural provisions of section 12 have, in fact, afforded considerable protection to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press. Mark Thomson, of Atkins Thomson Solicitors, put it this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref139" href="#footnote139">139</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It is important to note that section 12 of the HRA has made the threshold tests for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interim injunctions harder to obtain than before &#8211; in effect, a potential claimant has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to show that he or she would be more likely than not to succeed at trial on proving the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">threatened publication is unlawful. Despite what the press say, for an interim court</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">measure, that is a high threshold, and one which is meant to reflect the importance of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">freedom of speech. This point was recognised by Jack Straw and Professor Phillipson</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in their evidence before the Select Committee.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-26"><a href="#para3-26" name="para3-26">3.26</a></p>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Lord Wakeham has kindly reminded me of what I said [at the time] ... it was words to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">theeffectthatthe introductionofsection12shouldmake these interlocutoryinjunctions</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pretty rare, and people in general would go to the Press Complaints Commission. We</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">can argue about the extent to which they are relatively rare. There has been a lot of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">publicity about individual ones, but they are fewer in number than is imagined&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-27"><a href="#para3-27" name="para3-27">3.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nonetheless, it is necessary to keep this in perspective. As already pointed out at paragraph</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">3.18 above above, section 12 of the HRA broadly reflected principles laid down by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.</span>
<h3>Reflections</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-28"><a href="#para3-28" name="para3-28">3.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is clear that the press in general, and Lord Wakeham in particular, lobbied heavily against</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Human Rights Bill insofar as it related to the press and related freedom of expression</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues. It is also clear that section 12 of the HRA was seen at the time as a form of compromise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between competing interests. Even so, the robust evidence received from Mr Straw suggests</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, although press/Wakeham lobbying had an influence on the ultimate course of events,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there were other sound reasons for enacting section 12.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Section 12 did not of course create a complete immunity for the press from the ambit of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">HRA. Following the comment that Lord Wakeham made to the Joint Committee on Privacy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Injunctions to the effect that he was disappointed that section 12 had not achieved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what had been hoped and that he wanted to encourage the use of the PCC,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref141" href="#footnote141">141</a></sup> there was the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">following exchange:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref142" href="#footnote142">142</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q (Lord Greenford): Do you think you succeeded in making freedom of expression</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">superior to the right of privacy?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Lord Wakeham: No, I do not. I think there was a balance, but the balance was not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">even-steven. What I thought I had achieved was what Jack Straw said in the House</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of Commons when he introduced section 12; I thought he got it exactly right at that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">time. It has not worked out like that, and I am disappointed.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-30"><a href="#para3-30" name="para3-30">3.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the other hand, Professor Gavin Phillipson told the Joint Committee:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref143" href="#footnote143">143</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Can I just add that there was nothing in section 12 to suggest that cases should be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">steered off to the Press Complaints Commission? Section 12 tells the courts what to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">do. It does not say anything about whether or not someone would prefer to go to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">PCC and there is nothing in it to say that injunctions will be rare. It simply says that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">injunctions will be granted only if the court thinks that the claimant has the stronger</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">case. If the claimant has the stronger case they will get the injunction&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">devoted to narrower questions relating to the way in which s77-78 of the Criminal Justice and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Immigration Act 2008 came to be enacted, but not implemented and, in particular, how far</span>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In this context, it is unnecessary to address any, save one of the issues raised in the Information</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">seriousness of the crime, even within the judicial system. They likewise do little to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deter those who seek to buy or supply confidential information that should rightly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">remain private. The remedy I am proposing is to introduce a custodial sentence of up</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to two years for persons convicted on indictment, and up to six months for summary</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">convictions. The aim is not to send more people to prison but to discourage all who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">might be tempted to engage in this unlawful trade.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In order to give effect to these recommendations, primary legislation would need to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enacted to alter the maximum penalties laid down in s60 of the DPA for breaches of s55. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO noted that a follow-up report would be published within six months in order to monitor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">progress on the recommendations made.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At least initially, the Government appeared to be amenable in principle to introducing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a custodial sanction in line with the ICO&#8217;s recommendation. The Foreword of<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been encouraging:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref146" href="#footnote146">146</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;These concerns, and the need for increased penalties, have been raised with the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Department for Constitutional Affairs. The positive response that I have received</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">so far is encouraging. These are early and welcome indications of progress on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">possibility of Government action.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 24 July 2006, the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) published a consultation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">paper on increasing the penalties for breaches of s55.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref147" href="#footnote147">147</a></sup> This sought views on whether the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposed custodial sentences would act as an effective deterrent to those who deliberately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or recklessly misused personal information. The consultation period ended on 30 October</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">2006.</span>

<h3>Responses to the consultation document</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The majority of respondents welcomed the introduction of custodial sentences. They</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indicated that the introduction of such sentences would provide a greater deterrence to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potential offenders, provide public reassurance that offenders would receive the appropriate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sentence, and achieve parity with a number of disparate pieces of legislation which dealt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with similar offences.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-7"><a href="#para4-7" name="para4-7">4.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, although the ICO&#8217;s recommendations were not specifically targeted at the press,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was the press that co-ordinated the vociferous formal objections to them. In response to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the consultation, the press strongly argued that the introduction of such penalties would</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">have a &#8216;chilling effect&#8217; on journalism and that this was contrary to the principle of freedom of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expression.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-8"><a href="#para4-8" name="para4-8">4.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Notwithstanding these objections, the Government&#8217;s position remained that the introduction</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of custodial sentences was both appropriate and in accordance with the views of the majority</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of respondents to the consultation document. By the time the ICO&#8217;s follow-up report,</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...continue to press the government to introduce the option of a prison sentence and</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 7February2007,theSecretaryof StateforConstitutional Affairs,LordFalconerof Thoroton</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I have today published the Government response to the consultation paper</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The response sets out how we will reform section 60 of the Data Protection Act</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">1998 to ensure that there is robust protection for personal data, and to strengthen</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">individuals&#8217; right to privacy&#8230;. The Government believe that the existing financial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">penalties are not sufficiently protecting people&#8217;s personal data.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">&#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">In summary, following careful consideration of the responses received, we are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proceeding with the proposals to introduce custodial sentences to section 60 of the</span>

<h3>The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-10"><a href="#para4-10" name="para4-10">4.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By clause 75 (later clause 129) of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, it was proposed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to amend s60 of the DPA to increase the penalties for offences under s55 of the Act, to allow</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for a period of imprisonment of up to six months following summary conviction and up to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">two years following conviction on indictment. It is important to note that, at that stage, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government did not have in mind any other alteration to the law such as the introduction of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a subjective element to the existing public interest defence.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref151" href="#footnote151">151</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-11"><a href="#para4-11" name="para4-11">4.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Bill received its Second Reading in the House of Commons on 8 October 2007, and at that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stage Clause 75 did not appear to be generating any serious controversy. As at 27 November</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2007, the Government was still actively rejecting any suggestion that this clause could have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a &#8216;chilling effect&#8217; on the press, and were pressing ahead with the relevant amendments.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref152" href="#footnote152">152</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-12"><a href="#para4-12" name="para4-12">4.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, in early 2008 it became clear that the press was organising a serious and concerted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">campaign against the proposals. The Rt Hon Jack Straw MP was Secretary of State for Justice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">during the relevant period.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref153" href="#footnote153">153</a></sup> His written evidence records that he received a number of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">representations from members of the press particularly in January 2008, and that a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of meetings to discuss the press concerns were held.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref154" href="#footnote154">154</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">By February 2008, and following continued vociferous representations from the press, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government was proposing to withdraw clause 75 (now clause 129) completely. The ICO</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expressed deep regret at this proposed course of action.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref155" href="#footnote155">155</a></sup> A letter from Mr Richard Thomas</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dated 4 March 2008 noted that:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The representations against the measure from media organisations have not been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">convincing. In effect, they are arguing against a criminal offence which has been on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the statute for many years. They object to tougher sanctions against activities which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they say do not exist or are not widespread. The louder their protests against stronger</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">penalties, the more it suggests questionable practices. The offence is only committed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">when there is deliberate or reckless disclosure of personal data without the consent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the organisation which holds it. The implication of their case is that they wish to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">able to break the law...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">This is a pernicious, and largely hidden, illegal market and I am determined to stop it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-14"><a href="#para4-14" name="para4-14">4.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas met the Prime Minister on 5 March 2008 to discuss the proposed withdrawal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of clause 75. Mr Thomas&#8217;s notes of the meeting record that the Prime Minister &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> accepted</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that a strong sentence is needed to deter all those involved&#8221;,<span style="font-style:normal"> but</span><span style="font-style:normal"> &#8220;</span> at the same time, he is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">concerned to strike the right balance with protecting freedom of the press, especially in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relation to legitimate investigative journalism. Now that some time has been bought (between</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Committee and Report stages in the Lords) he wants a compromise position to be achieved to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">minimise media concerns.<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref156" href="#footnote156">156</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-15"><a href="#para4-15" name="para4-15">4.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The compromise which was in the end achieved saw the replacement of clause 75 with two</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provisions, each of which required secondary legislation to be activated: the first providing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an additional defence to the offence in s55 of the DPA as to subjective belief in the journalism</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in question being in the public interest; and the second providing for an increase in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">maximum penalties under s55 to terms of imprisonment in line with the original proposals,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but only after consultation. These provisions were enacted in the form of ss77 and 78 of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 and, as has already been noted, the relevant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">secondary legislation has not as yet been introduced.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-16"><a href="#para4-16" name="para4-16">4.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Government&#8217;s official position therefore changed radically during this period. It is clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that pressure from the press as a whole was brought to bear, but cause and effect is not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessarily established by narrating the relevant sequence of events. The influence of press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lobbying, and the Government&#8217;s reasons for their change of policy, therefore fall to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">examined.</span>

<h3>Evidence of lobbying behind the scenes: reasons for the policy change</h3>


<p id="para-id-4-17"><a href="#para4-17" name="para4-17">4.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Not merely did representatives of the press makes strong public representations against the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">introduction of a custodial sentence, but a number of significant meetings took place behind</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the scenes. The issue was clearly one which the press had taken to heart, and the nature of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the relationship of a number of key players with politicians was such that ready access was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">available.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Prime Minister, Mr Brown, dined with Les Hinton, Murdoch MacLennan and Paul Dacre</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on 10 September 2007. Mr Hinton, then Executive Chairman of News International, did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">give evidence to the Inquiry. Mr MacLennan gave evidence on 10 January 2012 but was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">asked to deal with this occasion. The accounts I received from Mr Brown and Mr Dacre are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different in emphasis if not in substance. Mr Brown&#8217;s account of the dinner was as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref157" href="#footnote157">157</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. I remember the issue. I told them, as we started the dinner, what my own view</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was. I didn&#8217;t ask them for their view, I&#8217;m afraid. Maybe I should have. I told them what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my view was, that there should be a public interest defence, and therefore it wasn&#8217;t a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">question of them lobbying me. I was informing them that this was my view, but that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Michael Wills, who was an excellent minister, and Jack Straw, who was doing a great</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">job on this, were consulting people about how we could implement this in a way</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">where there was a public interest defence but we weren&#8217;t going to back off entirely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the potential need for legislation.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Mr Dacre&#8217;s account doesn&#8217;t quite match that, Mr Brown. Under tab 34, he gave a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">speech to the Society of Editors conference on 9 November 2008. So it&#8217;s about 16, 17</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">months after the relevant date.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A. Yes.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. He says:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;About 18 months ago [he means on 10 September 2007] I, Les Hinton of News</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">International and Murdoch McLellan [sic] of the Telegraph, had dinner with the Prime</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Minister Gordon Brown. On the agenda was our deep concern that the newspaper</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">industry was facing a number of very serious threats to its freedoms.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Then he said:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The fourth issue we raised with Gordon Brown was a truly frightening amendment</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the Data Protection Act.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">This is the amendment &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any disagreement in these accounts. He had it on his agenda</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for the meeting. They raised it, but I told them as they raised it: &#8220;Look, this is my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">view.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t say, &#8220;I&#8217;m waiting to hear your view&#8221;; I told them: &#8220;This is my view.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I remember this distinctly. I had already made up my mind before I went into the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">meeting, and I told Jack and Michael that there should be a public interest defence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and that we should probably postpone the implementation of this clause. Look, at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that time, of course, we didn&#8217;t have all the information we now have about the abuse</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of this &#8211; of data by the media. At that time, there was no suggestion that there was</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">anything other than what was called the rogue hacker. But again, my instinct is still</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the same, that there ought to be a public interest defence. I know it&#8217;s uncomfortable,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">because you are balancing off two freedoms, as we said at the beginning. You have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this right that I would defend for people to have privacy, and you have this right of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the media, I would say the individual, to express themselves and for the media to do</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this through a freedom of speech and therefore a willingness or ability to investigate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">things that are wrong, and you are balancing off these two freedoms. It seemed to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">me that we may end up with the custodial sentences, and that was an option that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was left to us. We said we&#8217;d come back to this, but at that time we thought that &#8211; let</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">us look at whether a public interest defence can be introduced into this legislation,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which is what we did.&#8221;</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref157" name="footnote157" title="Go back to footnote reference 157 in the text">157</a>.  pp74-76, lines 10-19, Gordon Brown, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-11-June-2012.pdf</p><!--footnote-->

<span style="font-size: 15px;">During the course of his oral evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Dacre touched on his lecture to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Society of Editors in 2008 but was not asked to address in detail the exact circumstances in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which the DPA issued was raised and discussed on this occasion; there was evidently not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thought to be an issue about it at that time. His understanding was that Mr Brown was hugely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sympathetic to the industry&#8217;s case and promised to do what he could to help.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref158" href="#footnote158">158</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-20"><a href="#para4-20" name="para4-20">4.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Brown&#8217;s recollection was that the initiative came from him, rather than that he was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responding to press influence or pressure. Mr Dacre&#8217;s was more along the lines that he and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his press colleagues had proved to be persuasive.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-21"><a href="#para4-21" name="para4-21">4.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A few questions perhaps arise. First, if Mr Brown was as sympathetic to the press case as Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dacre claimed, why was the Government were still pressing ahead with a Bill introducing a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">custodial sentence without a revised public interest defence as late as 27 November 2007?</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Secondly, Mr Brown&#8217;s testimony did not touch on the issue of the custodial sentence which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was, after all, at the centre of the press concerns; he referred instead to the need for a public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest defence. This overlooks the fact that s55 of the DPA in its un-amended form already</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contained such a defence, admittedly one cast in objective form.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-22"><a href="#para4-22" name="para4-22">4.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lastly, Mr Brown&#8217;s assertion that, in September 2007, his knowledge as to the extent of data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">abuse was somewhat limited (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> didn&#8217;t</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> all</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> information</span><span style="font-style:italic"> we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> now</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> about</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">abuse of this &#8211; of data by the media. At that time, there was no suggestion that there was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">anything other than what was called the rogue hacker&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> )</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref159" href="#footnote159">159</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> may</span><span style="font-style:normal"> be</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span><span style="font-style:normal"> mis-recollection</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">background events that triggered the move to amend the legislation. The contents of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO&#8217;s two reports were the reason for Parliament debating amendments to the statute in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the first place: there was no doubting what they said. The &#8216;rogue hacker&#8217; issue was relevant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the standing of the press and the extent to which journalists were likely to break the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">law but it had no bearing on the Motorman case: there was no question of increasing the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">penalty for offences under RIPA and both Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire had, in fact,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been sentenced to terms of imprisonment.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-23"><a href="#para4-23" name="para4-23">4.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Accordingly, the impact of the private dinner of 10 September 2007 on the evolution of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government policy at this time is difficult to tell. Mr Dacre clearly believed that it made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a difference; an examination of the chronology suggests that official Government policy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remained unchanged.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-24"><a href="#para4-24" name="para4-24">4.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Responsibility for the policy and the navigation of the legislative amendments through</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Parliament lay with Mr Straw as Secretary of State for Justice. As has been pointed out, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as was scarcely unusual, Mr Straw was also subject to behind-the-scenes lobbying by senior</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">members of the press, including Mr MacLennan, Mrs Brooks, Guy Black and Mr Dacre, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">latter of whom Mr Straw had known from their university days and with whom he enjoyed a</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">&#8216;respectful&#8217; relationship.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref160" href="#footnote160">160</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-25"><a href="#para4-25" name="para4-25">4.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Straw&#8217;s written evidence recorded that as a result of the representations made by the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(which included those received at a meeting that he had with Mr Dacre, Mr MacLennan and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mrs Brooks), and despite the Government&#8217;s commitment to bringing in custodial sentences,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he proposed to ministerial colleagues that the relevant clause should be withdrawn from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Bill to enable all parties to work out a compromise.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref161" href="#footnote161">161</a></sup> Interestingly, at no stage during his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">written or oral testimony did Mr Straw indicate that he had had any conversation with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prime Minister which referenced the latter&#8217;s preference for a public interest defence.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In oral evidence, Mr Straw explained why the Government&#8217;s position changed. Having referred</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to meetings he had had with various parties, Mr Straw was asked:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref162" href="#footnote162">162</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q: If we can look at the text of the letter dated 12 February 2008, you write to Mr.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Dacre. Under the heading &#8220;Data Protection Act&#8221;, you say:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We&#8217;re not proposing to criminalise any conduct which is currently against the law.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">However, we do understand your and the media&#8217;s concerns more generally about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the introduction of custodial sentences for breach of section 55. We have no wish to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">curtail legitimate and responsible journalism, and when the proposed penalties were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">designed it was not considered that they would have that effect. We&#8217;re not aware</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that section 55 has caused any problems such as a chilling effect since the DPA came</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">into force. The penalties were proposed and strongly argued for by the Information</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Commissioner to strengthen the protection of individuals&#8217; rights to respect for their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">privacy... But I have reviewed your proposals in light of the important points which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you and others have made. As I explained when we met, I was increasingly minded</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to consider inclusion of provision for the reasonable belief of someone at the time</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an offence was committed. I understand that there will still be considerable anxiety</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about the potential impact of this measure and that there is, therefore a case of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reconsidering it in slower time.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Then you say</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Alongside this, I am faced with the overwhelming need to achieve royal assent for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the bill by 8 May 2008, when the existing legal restrictions against prison officers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">taking industrial action otherwise terminate. Taking all these factors into account, I&#8217;m</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">making a further recommendation to colleagues and I will be back in touch&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So you&#8217;re faced here, Mr. Straw, with a double pincer movement. On the one hand,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you have the press stirring up trouble, making the arguments you&#8217;d expect them to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">make, and we can analyse those in a moment, and you would say, perhaps even more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">importantly, you had to get the bill through by a particular date because there were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other provisions in it which were absolutely vital. Is that it?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: Yes... I&#8217;m afraid that other issues then became subordinate to it. That&#8217;s life, that&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">politics.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q: Mr. Straw, we understand this is, as it were, a classic case study in realpolitik.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Royal Assent had to be obtained by a certain date for reasons extraneous really to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">merits of section 55. Had it not been for that consideration and/or the pressure you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were under by the press, would your policy position have been either adhere to the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">original position, in other words just up the sentence to include a custodial penalty,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or were you in fact persuaded by the merits of the argument that the subjective/</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">objective test should be introduced?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: .... I&#8217;d like to say that even in slower time I would have made the same judgment</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about the subjective defence that was inserted, but I can&#8217;t say for certain ... I am</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">absolutely clear that the two went together, and I mean I regret the fact that that I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">didn&#8217;t bring in the amendment to section 55 before the election, and I think it ought</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to have been brought in by now, but there we are&#8221;</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref162" name="footnote162" title="Go back to footnote reference 162 in the text">162</a>.  pp46-51, lines 13-25, Jack Straw, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-16-May-2012.pdf</p><!--footnote-->

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The immediate cause of the compromise, which ultimately was fashioned in the form of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ss77 and 78 of the 2008 Act, was the political reality of the need to enact the whole statute</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">before 8 May 2008, in the face of a threat of industrial action by prison officers. Mr Straw</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in particular formed the political judgment that this could only be achieved by compromise,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">notwithstanding that this had, at least, the appearance of yielding to pressure. Although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Government had a sufficient majority in the House of Commons to force through this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legislation in its original form, it had never had a majority in the House of Lords, and there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clearly was a risk that the Peers might decide to block or delay the Bill on this very point.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref163" href="#footnote163">163</a></sup> By</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then, the press had very publicly made it an issue, which was no doubt part of their overall</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">strategy.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-28"><a href="#para4-28" name="para4-28">4.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Straw was also asked to explain whether he had been persuaded by the logic and overall</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">merits of the press case, or whether political imperatives predominated. Understandably,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and very frankly, Mr Straw found that a difficult question to answer given the difficulty in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disentangling cause from effect: as he put it,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;because</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> became</span><span style="font-style:italic"> persuaded,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> if</span><span style="font-style:italic"> you</span><span style="font-style:italic"> follow</span><span style="font-style:italic"> me,</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">so you have to work out why you were persuaded...&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref164" href="#footnote164">164</a></sup></span>
<h3>Reflections</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-29"><a href="#para4-29" name="para4-29">4.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence leaves no room for doubt that the press brought its full resources and influence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to bear on an issue about which it clearly felt very strongly. In that respect, it was acting no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">differently from any other interested party with political influence in relation to proposed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">policy or legislative changes. Their case was highly stated, and to a degree they had the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government over a barrel on timing. The merits of the argument are dealt with in detail in</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Part H.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-30"><a href="#para4-30" name="para4-30">4.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The dinner engagement of 10 September 2007 must have made it clear to Mr Brown just</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">how seriously the press was prepared to campaign on this issue, and one way or another he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made it clear to his interlocutors that he might be prepared to move on aspects of the policy.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having said that, the DPA amendments was only the fourth item on Mr Dacre&#8217;s agenda and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as has already been pointed out, the Government adhered in the short term to its policy.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-31"><a href="#para4-31" name="para4-31">4.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">But Mr Brown would have been aware of how high the stakes had become, and that if the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">passage of the amendments through Parliament became problematic, for any reason, then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he was taking a significant political risk. These risks became more acute in January 2008 as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressure mounted, press lobbying intensified and deadlines loomed. Furthermore, there was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at least some presentational attraction in the argument that the increase in the sentencing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">options should be matched by a broadening of the scope of the public interest defence.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-32"><a href="#para4-32" name="para4-32">4.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, if anxiety about the passage of the Bill prior to 8 May 2008 might explain the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">compromise at that time, it does not explain why in the two years that followed the passage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the legislation until the general election, the legislation was not, in fact, commenced.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nobody has suggested that the policy had changed because something had happened to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cause the Government to consider that the legislation had been misconceived. A more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">plausible explanation may be that the impetus that had been provided by the<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">election meant that a further battle with the press over implementation was the last thing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the Government wanted.</span>

<h2>5. Communications Act 2003</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Communications Act 2003 (the 2003 Act) represented a major and controversial landmark</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in New Labour&#8217;s media policy. Its main features in relation to plurality and media ownership</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have already been outlined earlier in this Report.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref165" href="#footnote165">165</a></sup> The Act had a protracted legislative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">history covering a wide array of media issues. This sub-section of the Report focuses on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the genesis of those parts of the Act which relate to newspaper ownership, particularly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">foreign ownership, and cross media ownership involving national newspapers and terrestrial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">television. So far as terrestrial television is concerned, for reasons which will become clear,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the focus is on Channel 5. In particular, this sub-section seeks to examine the relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between politicians and the national press as it relates to the legislative process.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Legislation was considered and in due course enacted in the context of a rapidly changing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media landscape. Digital media and satellite television, in particular, were both growing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prodigiously. At the start of the story, the position was that (save for EU and EEA countries)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">foreign ownership of,<span style="font-style:italic"> inter</span><span style="font-style:italic"> alia</span> , analogue terrestrial television was prohibited.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref166" href="#footnote166">166</a></sup> Moreover,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cross media ownership was the subject of quantitative limits including a rule which stipulated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that no proprietor of a national newspaper could be a participant with more than a 20%</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest in a body corporate which was the holder of a licence to provide a Channel 3 service,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or Channel 5, or a national radio service.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref167" href="#footnote167">167</a></sup> Consequently, Rupert Murdoch, could not have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acquired Channel 5, had it been for sale, on not just one but two separate regulatory grounds:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ban on foreign ownership and the 20:20 rule.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-3"><a href="#para5-3" name="para5-3">5.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By the time that the 2003 Act became law, the position on both fronts had been reversed.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was no ban on foreign ownership and the 20:20 rule, insofar as it applied to Channel 5,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been dropped. It is true that a public interest plurality test had been inserted which would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have had to be applied to any bid by Mr Murdoch for Channel 5 but that was only as the result</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of determined campaigning against the Government by Lord Puttnam. The regulatory door</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been opened, by the Labour Government, for Mr Murdoch, amongst others, to bid for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the terrestrial channel, if it came up for sale. How did the change come about? Is there any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">merit in the suggestion (made at the time) that there was a &#8216;deal&#8217;, between Mr Murdoch and</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the then Labour Government?<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref168" href="#footnote168">168</a></sup> What influence, if any, did the media have on this policy?</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These are the issues to be explored.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-4"><a href="#para5-4" name="para5-4">5.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Many of the arguments deployed by diverse interests during the course of the consultations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and debates which took place remain pertinent to the question of media plurality today but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are not fully explored here. Current and future plurality issues are considered later in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Report.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref169" href="#footnote169">169</a></sup></span>

<a name="page1278"></a><!--new page--><h3>The Legislative Process</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-5"><a href="#para5-5" name="para5-5">5.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The development of policy on media ownership and the resulting legislation which gave</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">life to the policy, rested jointly with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI). The Secretary of State for Culture, Media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Sport was initially Chris Smith, now Lord Smith, and, later, Tessa Jowell. Stephen Byers,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and later Patricia Hewitt, were their counterparts at the DTI. Tony Blair was consulted at key</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stages and was involved in the decision making on a number of issues as to the direction of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the legislation.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-6"><a href="#para5-6" name="para5-6">5.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Striking features of the legislative process were both the length of time it took and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extensiveconsultation,scrutinyanddebatewhichoccurred,eachindicatorsoftheimportance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and sensitivity of the subject matter. A Communications White Paper<span style="font-style:italic"> A</span><span style="font-style:italic"> New</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Future</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Stephen Byers but the Act did not receive Royal Assent until 17 July 2003. In between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there were extensive consultations, a draft bill published in May 2002, pre-legislative scrutiny</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by a Joint Committee (described by Ms Jowell as a relatively unusual process), as well as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considerable debate in both Houses, notably consideration of a number of amendments by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the House of Lords.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref170" href="#footnote170">170</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-7"><a href="#para5-7" name="para5-7">5.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of some significance is the fact that Ms Jowell felt it necessary, shortly after her appointment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, to ask Mr Blair in terms whether or not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he had reached a &#8216;deal&#8217; with Mr Murdoch on the reform of cross media ownership rules. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">demonstrates that even within the Cabinet there was suspicion that an arrangement might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been reached:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref171" href="#footnote171">171</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Can I start by asking you whether you had any conversations with the prime</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">minister of the time when you took up the portfolio?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes, I did. From memory, it was, I think, the day after or within a couple of days of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">being appointed, once I had had time to assess what the priorities were for me as an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">incoming Secretary of State, what was in the in-tray.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I saw the Prime Minister, as I say, within a couple of days of my appointment, and I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had a conversation with him which was, I think, necessary, and I asked him whether</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or not any deal had been done with Rupert Murdoch on the reform of the cross-media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ownership rules. He gave me an absolute assurance, which I completely accepted, that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there had been no prior agreement, so that it &#8211; to a great extent, I had no constraints</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the conclusions I might reach...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-8"><a href="#para5-8" name="para5-8">5.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Blair confirmed Ms Jowell&#8217;s account of the conversation and that there was no implied</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deal with Mr Murdoch. He was not surprised by his Minister&#8217;s question, a fact which says</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">something at least about contemporary perceptions about the relationship between Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch and Mr Blair:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref172" href="#footnote172">172</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-9"><a href="#para5-9" name="para5-9">5.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Throughout there was a good deal of lobbying by interested parties. Amongst the many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lobbyists were News International and BSkyB. Views were received through written</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">submissions, formal meetings, if requested, correspondence and participation in conferences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and seminars.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref173" href="#footnote173">173</a></sup> News International contended that competition law was all that was required</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be further improved by the removal of the special newspaper regime that currently</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">News International was not alone in their view. All broadcasters, except Channel 4, maintained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there should be no restriction on ITV/Channel 5 joint ownership save for competition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">law.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref175" href="#footnote175">175</a></sup> Bloomberg LP forcefully pressed the case for the removal of the foreign ownership</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rules,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref176" href="#footnote176">176</a></sup> as did Telewest. DMGT complained, via a letter to Charles Clarke, then Minister</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Without Portfolio and Party Chairman, about the competitive disadvantage which it felt arose</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the domestic regulatory regime:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref177" href="#footnote177">177</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The fact is that foreign media companies are able to use the more relaxed regulatory</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">climate of their home countries to build the kind of powerful domestic base that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enable them, through acquisition, to become major global players. The irony is that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">these foreign firms are then able to acquire major British media companies that are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">denied to the Daily Mail & General Trust &#8211; an all British company &#8211; because of this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">country&#8217;s regulatory climate&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It contended:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;For the future, DMGT wants clear, consistent rules and an open and transparent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regulatory environment...&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">A briefing note from the period succinctly sets out the then Government&#8217;s thinking on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">democracy, plurality and diversity:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref180" href="#footnote180">180</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Our democracy and our cultural vitality depend on the availability of a range of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">different media voices, views and styles. The ownership of our newspapers, television</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and radio is therefore of the utmost importance. That is why the Government is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">concerned to ensure that citizens can receive a diversity of media content from a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">plurality of sources.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;DiversityisabouthavingawiderangeofcontentandintheWhitePaper,aNewFuture</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for Communications, we set out the commitments to public service broadcasting and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">positive content regulation that we believe will be sufficient to ensure this diversity.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Plurality is not about content but the source of that content, the &#8220;voice&#8221; behind it &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the owner. A plurality of voices should:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; ensure no individual has excessive control over the democratic process;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; provide a plurality of sources of news and editorial opinion, preserving the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">culture of dissent and argument on which our democracy rests;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; prevent the emergence of any one source able to control the news agenda by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the inclusion / omission of particular stories;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; maintain our cultural vitality by ensuring that different companies exist to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">produce different styles of programming and publishing, each with a different</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">look and feel.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We therefore need regulation that is specifically directed to ensure plurality and that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is why we have imposed rules on media ownership&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-13"><a href="#para5-13" name="para5-13">5.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence discussed in more detail below is consistent with the pursuit of these policy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">objectives throughout, although there was considerable debate about the best kind of rule to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apply and the precise formulation thereof so as adequately to protect plurality whilst at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">same time minimising the impact upon economic growth and the market.</span>

<h3>Foreign ownership of terrestrial television</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-14"><a href="#para5-14" name="para5-14">5.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At the start of the legislative exercise the Government&#8217;s position was that the existing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prohibitions on foreign (non EU/EEA) ownership of,<span style="font-style:italic"> inter</span><span style="font-style:italic"> alia</span> , analogue terrestrial television</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be maintained. The purpose of this prohibition, as expressed in the Communications</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">White Paper, was to help ensure that European consumers continued to receive high quality</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">European content. It was further felt that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> without</span><span style="font-style:italic"> reciprocal</span><span style="font-style:italic"> reforms</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> countries</span><span style="font-style:italic"> like</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">US or Australia that put restrictions on British companies, we cannot justify lifting our ban</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at the present time&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref181" href="#footnote181">181</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> However,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> downside</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> rule</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> it</span><span style="font-style:normal"> excluded</span><span style="font-style:normal"> investment</span></span>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref180" name="footnote180" title="Go back to footnote reference 180 in the text">180</a>.  p2, Tessa Jowell, https://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Exhibit-TJ13.pdf</p><!--footnote-->

<a name="page1281"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;So the very important and balanced judgment that we had to make was the extent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that we could open up the possibility of American investment, Japanese investment,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Australian investment in our British media without prejudicing the quality and without</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">jeopardising plurality.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-15"><a href="#para5-15" name="para5-15">5.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News International lost no time and lobbied energetically on the issue from an early stage. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">took issue with the status quo in its formal response to the White Paper.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref183" href="#footnote183">183</a></sup> Les Hinton wrote</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Ms Jowell and Kim Howells (then the newly appointed Parliamentary Undersecretary of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">State at DCMS) in June 2001 to congratulate them upon their appointments and sought a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meeting. He met Mr Howells on 26 July 2001, following up first with a brief letter the same</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">day in which he wrote: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> am</span><span style="font-style:italic"> particularly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> delighted</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hear</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> contrary</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> White</span><span style="font-style:italic"> paper,</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Government is prepared to consult on the foreign ownership prohibitions&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref184" href="#footnote184">184</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> then</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with a longer letter dated 8 August 2001 fully articulating News International&#8217;s position on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this issue and on cross media ownership.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref185" href="#footnote185">185</a></sup> The letter contained a thinly veiled threat to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">litigate relying upon Article 10 of the ECHR (freedom of expression), read with Article 14</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(prohibiting discrimination) and concluded:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Foreign ownership prohibitions are unnecessary, anachronistic and discriminatory.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, they are an insult to those foreigners such as Roy Thomson and Max</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Beaverbrook, whose contributions made Fleet Street what it was &#8211; not to say to those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">foreigners who are currently active in this industry.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-16"><a href="#para5-16" name="para5-16">5.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Government initially was not persuaded. As the consultation document was launched Ms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Jowell briefed the Prime Minister in November 2001 in the following terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref186" href="#footnote186">186</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Foreign ownership of broadcasting: our working assumption is that we stick to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">line in the White Paper that there will be no lifting of foreign ownership restrictions.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We invite views on whether we should develop reciprocal arrangements with those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">countries which might lift restrictions on UK companies, or put this issue on the table</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">for WTO discussion.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-17"><a href="#para5-17" name="para5-17">5.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The documentary evidence shows that arrangements had been made for both Ms Jowell and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Patricia Hewitt to meet Mr Hinton on 26 November, although the indications are that that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meeting was subsequently postponed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref187" href="#footnote187">187</a></sup> Ms Jowell was again due to meet Mr Hinton on 23</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">January 2002, although it is unclear whether this meeting in fact went ahead.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref188" href="#footnote188">188</a></sup> There was no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">documentary record of such a meeting having taken place amongst the DCMS&#8217; disclosure and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so the meeting may not in fact have gone ahead.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-18"><a href="#para5-18" name="para5-18">5.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first sign of a shift in the Government&#8217;s position on foreign ownership appears in an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">internalbriefingdocumentpreparedforMsJowellon30January2002,followingconsideration</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of responses to the formal consultation process, which had been launched in November of</span>

<a name="page1282"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">of the consultation responses and fully reasoned. The author of the document noted that all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the major British companies (TV and radio) had argued for reciprocity. Foreign companies</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(News International, Bloomberg, Telewest) had called for the restrictions to be removed.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Some independent voices had argued for the retention or strengthening of the rules to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">maintain levels of high quality European content. Six considerations were set out in support</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the recommendation:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref189" href="#footnote189">189</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;1. Tier 1 and 2 requirements will guarantee original production, independent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">productionandUKregional productionandprogramming.Non-EEAcompanies</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could bring welcome inward investment.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;2. There is arguably no difference in principle between French or German</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ownership, which we currently allow, and US or Australian ownership which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we ban. To remove the ban is to remove an anomaly. Other European countries</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(eg Germany, Spain, the Netherlands) have removed foreign ownership rules</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">without any obvious adverse effect.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;3. Foreign owners are already allowed into the newspaper market, where there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">has been no obvious loss of &#8220;British&#8221; content.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;4. The Radio Authority argue that foreign ownership will dilute the &#8220;local&#8221; nature</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of services, but there seems no reason why a large US company should have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any more reason than a large UK company to degrade the service offered in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any local area.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;5. Foreign ownership can be difficult to identify, eg in the case of Sky, which the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ITC do not consider to be a foreign-controlled company.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;6. A position of reciprocity would in effect add up to a ban on American</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">companies, given that the US is extremely unlikely to remove their rules on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">foreign ownership in the foreseeable future.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-19"><a href="#para5-19" name="para5-19">5.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Jowell did not accept the recommendations uncritically. An internal minute of 7 February</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2002 evidences the fact that she called for a note from the Radio Authority on foreign</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ownership. The official who considered that note did not feel that it provided a strong case</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for maintaining a ban on non-EEA ownership. The internal minute also records preliminary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legal advice about the strength of the ECHR challenge which had been threatened by News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">International (see 1.14 above) and Bloomberg. The view of the Department&#8217;s lawyers was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the matter was not clear cut and that the argument advanced against the secretary of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">state would involve an extension of the current law if it were to prevail.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref190" href="#footnote190">190</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-20"><a href="#para5-20" name="para5-20">5.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the result, both Ms Jowell and Ms Hewitt were persuaded that the best course was the</span>

<a name="page1283"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">7 May 2002. On the issue of foreign ownership, in the course of her statement about the Bill,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Jowell told the House:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref193" href="#footnote193">193</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We also intend to scrap the inconsistent rules that prevent the non-European</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ownership of some broadcasters. It makes no sense that French, Italian or German</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">companies can own television and radio licences, but Canadian, Australian or United</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">States companies cannot. The resultant inward investment should allow the UK to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">benefit rapidly from new ideas and technological developments. New blood and new</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">competition will help to give our industry the edge.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-21"><a href="#para5-21" name="para5-21">5.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In her evidence to the Inquiry, Ms Jowell, also explained how the change in policy thinking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to foreign ownership was interrelated with Ofcom&#8217;s emerging content regulation</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">role:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref194" href="#footnote194">194</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...we were very concerned to avoid a situation where we lifted the restriction on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">foreign ownership of terrestrial television in a way that invited dumping of low quality</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">content. So the decision on relaxing foreign ownership really moved alongside the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">development of our thinking on the content regulation role of Ofcom..&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-22"><a href="#para5-22" name="para5-22">5.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The history above has been set out at some length because it demonstrates an entirely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proper and reasoned approach to a significant policy decision. News International lobbied</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with characteristic determination (something that they would not have needed to do had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there been a pre-existing deal). The records show that in fact the change of policy on foreign</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ownership occurred as a result of the consideration of responses to a formal consultation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">process. Indeed further views were sought from the Radio Authority, and preliminary legal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advice taken about whether or not maintenance of the ban on foreign ownership would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discriminatory as alleged by News International and Bloomberg, before the Ministers made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their recommendation to Mr Blair. These are not the actions of persons seeking to advance a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular agenda, but those of persons seeking to make an informed decision.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-23"><a href="#para5-23" name="para5-23">5.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The reversal of position is consistent with a trend towards incorporating more, rather than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">less, deregulation as the policy developed. Both the removal of the ban on foreign ownership</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the relaxation of the 20:20 Rule in relation to Channel 5 (see below) exemplify this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">trend. The Ministers plainly took account of, and were influenced by, the responses to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consultation process. It was the responses of large foreign owned media companies which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proved more persuasive.</span>

<h3>Channel 5</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-24"><a href="#para5-24" name="para5-24">5.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Consideration of the relaxation of the 20:20 rule in relation to Channel 5 first requires some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">background. At the material time, Channel 5 was not for sale. Nor had either BSkyB, or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News Corporation, indicated a firm intention to bid for the channel if it did come onto the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">market. BSkyB was, however, potentially interested as is evidenced by an internal Sky memo,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obtained by DCMS through an undisclosed means, in which the possibility, amongst others,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a bid for Channel 5 is countenanced.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref195" href="#footnote195">195</a></sup> The memo is striking because it also appears to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">would happen if BSkyB bid for a Channel 3 licensee:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref197" href="#footnote197">197</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;For the record, shortly after Carlton made its bid for UN&M and Granada made its</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bids for both Carlton and UN&M, Irwin and I met with James Purnell. He confirmed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the Government would not rely on the 20:20 Rule to block a takeover bid by Sky</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for a Channel 3 licensee (and one would assume that the same approach would apply</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to Channel 5). James anticipated that any such bid by Sky would be referred to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Competition Commission (as was the case with bids by the ITV companies for each</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other). Assuming that the Competition Commission did not find such a bid by Sky to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be against the public interest, the Secretary of State would use the statutory power</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to amend the 20:20 Rule to ensure that it did not block that bid&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span> .</span>

<p id="para-id-5-25"><a href="#para5-25" name="para5-25">5.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not necessary to determine whether or not Mr Purnell did in fact say what is attributed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to him in the note because whatever he did say was overtaken by events when the rule fell to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be considered at the highest levels of Government as described below.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-26"><a href="#para5-26" name="para5-26">5.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">After publication of the draft Communications Bill, BSkyB&#8217;s potential interest in Channel 5 was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">confirmed by Tony Ball, then chief executive of BSkyB, who told the Guardian that a takeover</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Channel 5: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> could</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> interesting</span><span style="font-style:italic"> if</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> right</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref198" href="#footnote198">198</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-27"><a href="#para5-27" name="para5-27">5.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Channel 5 was in some difficulty because it had not lived up to financial expectations and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was rapidly losing money. It was entirely realistic to believe that it might be offered for sale</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to a large media organisation. One of its significant shareholders, United Business Media plc</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(UBM), had expressed the view to Ms Jowell, that its future best lay as a part of a larger media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisation and had gone so far as to identify BSkyB amongst others as a potential buyer.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Hollick, on behalf of UBM, wrote:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref199" href="#footnote199">199</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...As you know we own 36 per cent of Channel 5 which you visited recently. I was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">responsible for persuading the then Government to consider the award of a further</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">terrestrial franchise in the early 1990s. At the time I told the Government and the ITC</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that I anticipated that Channel 5 would have a brief and hopefully profitable career,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as a stand-alone station but would soon become part of a larger broadcasting and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">media enterprise where its small but innovative and different voice would thrive. I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had three particular options in mind; it should either become ITV 2 (to provide ITV</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with competitive bulk equivalent to the BBC), Sky 5 (where it would merge with Sky</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">1 and become the terrestrial arm of Sky), or Cable 1 (where it would become the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">terrestrial arm of the cable companies).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Channel 5 has indeed made a bright start and its ratings have exceeded our</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expectations but unfortunately its financial performance has fallen far short of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">plan and with its fifth birthday approaching it is still losing well over &#163;50 million per</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">year. The strategic and economic case for a merger of Channel 5 into a larger media</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Quite properly, Ms Jowell responded to UBM assuring Lord Hollick that his comments would</span>

<p id="para-id-5-29"><a href="#para5-29" name="para5-29">5.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Channel 5 had a very small audience share and did not enjoy universal coverage.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref201" href="#footnote201">201</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nevertheless, the concern in some quarters was that if it was acquired by News Corporation,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or BSkyB, then with the benefit of heavy investment it could grow in influence and audience</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">share and be used to cross-advertise BSkyB&#8217;s satellite channels. The scenario was taken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seriously enough to have been specifically covered in Ms Jowell and Ms Hewitt&#8217;s briefing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ahead of their appearance before the Joint Pre-Legislative Scrutiny Committee.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref202" href="#footnote202">202</a></sup> It is in this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context that the Government&#8217;s modification of the 20:20 rule falls to be considered.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-30"><a href="#para5-30" name="para5-30">5.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Despite a general wish to deregulate, the direction initially and jointly taken by Ms Jowell and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Hewitt in relation to Channel 5 was in favour of maintaining the 20:20 rule. Thus, on this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">point, their joint recommendations to Mr Blair, made by letter dated 7 March 2002, following</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the formal consultation, and in preparation for the publication of the draft Bill, were:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref203" href="#footnote203">203</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">competition rules to prevent undue dominance; maintaining restrictions on significant</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">and were detailed in annex 3 thereto as meaning:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref204" href="#footnote204">204</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A continuing restriction on large newspaper groups and subsidiaries (News</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">International and Sky, Trinity Mirror, and possibly Associated Newspapers in the near</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">future) owning any significant share of ITV or Channel 5 companies. Other newspaper</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">group, with less than 20% of the national market, would now be able to invest in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">terrestrial TV without the acquisition having to pass a public interest test.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (my</span></span>

<p id="para-id-5-31"><a href="#para5-31" name="para5-31">5.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The change in direction came as a result of discussions, shortly thereafter, with Mr Blair, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is evidenced by a discussion paper sent to him by Ms Jowell and Ms Hewitt. It is notable that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Blair was not seeking to impose a particular solution, rather he was seeking further to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explore different options. The recommendation specifically to remove all restrictions on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ownership of Channel 5 came from the Secretaries of State and not from the Prime Minister:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref205" href="#footnote205">205</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having said that, Ms Jowell, recalled that this exploration of deregulatory options was itself</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the result of Mr Blair encouraging her to go further than she might otherwise have gone:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref206" href="#footnote206">206</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I have no detailed recollection of the conversation at that meeting ten years ago,</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deregulatory than mine. He pushed me further than I might have gone myself on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">exploring deregulatory options, but that was a constructive part of the process.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-33"><a href="#para5-33" name="para5-33">5.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As to the recommendation, it was itself carefully reasoned in the discussion paper:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref207" href="#footnote207">207</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">allowing it to grow over time into a more serious competitor to ITV. ITV will also</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be able to benefit from new sources of investment, as long as that investment</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">doesn&#8217;t come from the British newspaper industry.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Advantages</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; This suggestion would be proprietor-neutral &#8211; it allows anyone to buy and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">invest in Channel 5.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; ITV would survive as a voice independent of newspapers&#8217; editorial agendas,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but will still be able to benefit from new sources of investment.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; There are some obvious justifications for making a distinction between ITV</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and Channel 5:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">C5 doesn&#8217;t cover the whole of the UK population, has low viewing figures and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">few public service broadcasting commitments.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ITV has a much more defined public service role, and comprises 15 regional</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">licences that cover the whole country. These regional licences are already</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the focus of a 20% rule, and cannot be joint-owned with more than 20% of a</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">region&#8217;s press.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; We could try to protect the independence of Channel 5 by maintaining or even</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">strengthening its public service requirements.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; Although Channel 5 is small in terms of viewing figures and influence now, with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">increased investment it may grow its share of both over the coming years, to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">remove the most obvious distinctions between it and ITV.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">POSSIBLE STEPS TO STRENGTHEN REGULATION OF CONTENT</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Whichever option we choose, Channel 5 might be owned by a large newspaper group,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and its audience share may grow. To address any concerns we might have over the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">quality of news and programming, there are some steps we could take to regulate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">content, rather than ownership...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-34"><a href="#para5-34" name="para5-34">5.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was a further meeting with Mr Blair and it was agreed to remove the restriction against</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sizeable newspaper companies owning Channel 5:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref208" href="#footnote208">208</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We have met twice to discuss the reform of media ownership rules. This letter</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">summarises the decisions we have taken. Our approach will be deregulatory wherever</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">possible, but we will retain a set of simple rules to prevent too great a concentration</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of ownership and political influence. Where we propose to remove rules (for example</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to allow sizeable newspaper companies to own Channel 5) content regulation will</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be able to maintain the quality, impartiality and diversity of programming and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">competition law will tend to encourage dispersed ownership and new entry...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-35"><a href="#para5-35" name="para5-35">5.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The then Prime Minister&#8217;s thinking was obviously influential in this decision, as Ms Jowell</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">readily acknowledged:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref209" href="#footnote209">209</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;He was in favour of this option and he agreed with me on the safeguards that should</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">accompany a decision to pursue this option to lift the ownership bar created by the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">20 per cent on Channel 5&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, later:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref210" href="#footnote210">210</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. I&#8217;m not for a moment suggesting that this wasn&#8217;t a considered decision and that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">these things can happen as policy and legislation develops, but my question was: was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it the influence of the Prime Minister&#8217;s thinking that set you on a course of thinking</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that led to you changing your mind?&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. Well, of course, it did, because he&#8217;s the Prime Minister, and, you know, when</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you develop &#8211; you&#8217;re a Secretary of State and you&#8217;re developing policy and the Prime</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Minister has a slightly different view from the one that you&#8217;re advancing, you take</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">that seriously.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-36"><a href="#para5-36" name="para5-36">5.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The safeguards referred to in the first of the quotations above concerned content regulation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the ability to require that Channel 5 took a nominated news provider in the event that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the channel grew significantly. Their inclusion indicates that consideration was clearly being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given to the plurality ramifications of the altered stance on Channel 5:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref211" href="#footnote211">211</a></sup></span>

<a name="page1288"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;But the safeguards I wanted to ensure was that if Channel 5 exploded on the back</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of new investment from being a tiny and rather marginal terrestrial company, that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Ofcom would be in a position to (a) require that they took a nominated news provider</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and that they would be in a position to exercise the content control that ITV, for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">instance, was accountable for&#8211;or accountable to&#8211;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-37"><a href="#para5-37" name="para5-37">5.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the course of denying the existence of any implied deal, Mr Blair confirmed his preference</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for deregulation, explained that he thought that Mr Murdoch was more interested in Channel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">3, and emphasised his wish to encourage very large foreign media companies to enter the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">United Kingdom&#8217;s market:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref212" href="#footnote212">212</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. In terms of the substance of the matter though, do you feel that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Communications Act reflected in any way an implied deal with Mr Murdoch or not?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. No, absolutely not. For a start, the thing that we did which was boost Ofcom</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is a thing that he absolutely disliked. And contrary to what&#8217;s often written about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this, Channel 5 was not his &#8211; I mean, I never thought he was (inaudible) Channel 5.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Channel 3 would have been a far better fit for him, and that he was unable to do. I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mean, my thing with this Communications Act &#8211; because I did talk to the ministers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about it several times, my thing was very much to do with trying to open up the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">media ownership thing.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;And I actually remember during the course of this piece of legislation, I actually</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wanted to see if there were major media companies, I mean people the Time Warners</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of this world, Viacom, I think, Axel Springer, other big organisations that if you had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a more open media policy would be prepared to come in, because what concerned</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">me always was that you needed &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t necessary just to have other media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ownerships, it was necessary to have other media owners with heft, with the ability</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to put major investment in, and frankly with the type of global media position that I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could see the world moving to.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-38"><a href="#para5-38" name="para5-38">5.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There can be no doubt that the relaxation of the 20% rule was good news for Mr Murdoch,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that the decision to relax the rule was personally influenced by Mr Blair. However, it does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not follow from those bare facts that there was any explicit arrangement to that effect; nor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">even that the latter pushed this point specifically in order to favour News Corp in the hope</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of maintaining its support. The evidence demonstrates a more complex position. There was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a clear desire to deregulate within the Government, the only differences being as to how</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">far deregulation should go. Mr Blair was ready to go further than Ms Jowell was initially</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prepared to go and she in turn was prepared to go further than her predecessor Lord Smith.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref213" href="#footnote213">213</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ultimately, this was an area in which a balance had to be struck between plurality safeguards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and market freedom and in which there was considerable room for differing views as to what</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">was best for the country.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-39"><a href="#para5-39" name="para5-39">5.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The decision was not unqualified good news for Mr Murdoch. As Mr Blair pointed out, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2003 Act contained much which News Corp did not like, not least insofar as it related to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ofcom. In relation to the 20% rule, the final decision to remove the rule only in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Channel 5, but not in relation to the more influential Channel 3 did not go anything like as far</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as News Corp had been seeking. Whilst it would be wrong to say that Mr Murdoch had no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest in Channel 5, the evidence does not demonstrate that it was a priority.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is an example of media policy being personally influenced by a prime minister and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as such, points to the importance of the personal access which many senior media figures</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have had to our Prime Ministers. There may not be a deal, actual or implied, but access to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">communicate one&#8217;s views in person to a Prime Minister who can directly influence policy is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potentially a very important advantage.</span>

<h3>Lord Puttnam&#8217;s amendment and the media plurality test</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-41"><a href="#para5-41" name="para5-41">5.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In relation to acquisitions by national newspaper owners of terrestrial television interests,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">before the enactment of the 2003 Act, a public interest test was applicable in three</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstances:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref214" href="#footnote214">214</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) Any application by any newspaper owner to hold a licence for GMTV, Channel 5, or any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">national radio service;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) Any application to hold a regional Channel 3 licence or a local radio licence, by any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">national or relevant local newspaper owner; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) Digital programme services could not be provided for three months after the award of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the licence to a national or relevant local newspaper owner unless a plurality test was</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">met.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-42"><a href="#para5-42" name="para5-42">5.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These rules were not thought to be helpful by DCMS and DTI. They initially consulted on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the possibility of incorporating an alternative public interest test into cross media ownership</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decisions, in terms which were summarised by Ms Jowell, when writing to Mr Blair, as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref215" href="#footnote215">215</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...We ask for views on whether the cross media ownership limits should be abolished,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">retained or reformulated. If they are retained in some form, we ask whether they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should be permeable, with decisions above the threshold of the formula subject to a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">plurality test, and whether such decisions should be taken by the Secretary of State</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">or by OFCOM.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-43"><a href="#para5-43" name="para5-43">5.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government thinking was at that stage concerned with whether to apply a plurality test</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">above a quantitative ownership threshold so as to make the threshold permeable. It was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the overarching test that was ultimately adopted following Lord Puttnam&#8217;s intervention. Even</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this limited proposal met with disfavour when the responses to the consultation paper had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been considered. DCMS officials noted that most respondents rejected the idea of a media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">plurality test and recommended against such a test:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref216" href="#footnote216">216</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Plurality tests are not well supported by the industry because they are inherently</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">uncertain. Given that we are offering significant deregulatory reforms in most areas,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and setting rules only where we feel we need to draw a line at what is acceptable in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">terms of plurality, there seems little point in offering additional flexibility where it is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not wanted.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The notion of some kind of plurality test was nevertheless explored further, and at Ms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Jowell&#8217;s request, the idea of expanding the plurality test in the newspaper regime to apply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to all mergers (including cross-media mergers) that involve newspapers was the subject of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">detailed ministerial submission prepared for her and Ms Hewitt in February 2002.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref217" href="#footnote217">217</a></sup> The fact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this paper was sought at all tends to suggest that the Ministers had open minds and were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">genuinely seeking to explore the options.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-45"><a href="#para5-45" name="para5-45">5.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The joint recommendation which ultimately went from the Secretaries of State to the Prime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Minister did not propose the inclusion in the draft Bill of a plurality test to be applied to cross</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media acquisitions. On the contrary, it recommended the abolition of the three extant public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest tests which applied to the acquisition of other media by a newspaper proprietor (see</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1.41 above):<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref218" href="#footnote218">218</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The three existing rules that together make any purchase of any broadcasting service</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by any newspaper proprietor subject to a public interest test will be removed. The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">scope of these tests is not clear; they discourage newspaper owners from attempting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">levels of consolidation that would not necessarily dilute plurality; and they distort</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the market by encouraging existing owners who wish to sell to accept bids from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">non-newspaper owners who will not have to wait to pass a public interest test (a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">parallel may be drawn with the recent purchase of the Express newspapers by a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">non-newspaper owner who was not subject to any test under the special newspaper</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">regime).&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-46"><a href="#para5-46" name="para5-46">5.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Plurality was instead to be ensured by quantitative limits on cross media ownership and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">competition law. The rules were to be the subject of automatic review by Ofcom no less than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">every three years. Insofar as it relates to national newspapers, their relevant proposals were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">summarised as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref219" href="#footnote219">219</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220; Cross-media ownership</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The existing patter of rules to be stripped down to those rules we feel are essential:</span>

<a name="page1291"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">the media. The ministers&#8217; underlying political thinking is well summarised in their joint letter</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">to Mr Blair:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref220" href="#footnote220">220</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We believe that the case for deregulation is powerful. There has been an explosion</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of media choice in recent years giving people a wide range of sources of news,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information, entertainment and other services. Meanwhile, the existing rules have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hampered some companies from expanding and developing while others find</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">themselves much freer. These anomalies are not good for investment, jobs or diversity</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of products for the consumer.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">However, we also believe that the media are different from other industries, which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">means that Competition law alone is insufficient. They are a uniquely powerful force</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in democracy and debate and there is a long history of some media owners using</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">national newspapers in particular to promote their views. We need a significant</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">degree of plurality of ownership for democracy to work, and competition law can&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">guarantee this for us. Our line is therefore to regulate ownership on top of competition</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">law, but only where absolutely necessary &#8211; imposing a simple set of barriers to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">excessive concentration.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We are therefore proposing substantial deregulation, both within each media sector</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(radio, TV, local newspapers, and national newspapers) and also between them,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">subject to retaining reduced but still significant controls on cross-ownership of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">national newspapers and major terrestrial TV channels.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-48"><a href="#para5-48" name="para5-48">5.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A revealing part of the joint submission made by the Secretaries of State to the Prime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Minister is the annex listing potential commercial winners and losers on the proposals as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they then stood. The &#8220;Big Winners&#8221; are stated to be terrestrial television companies, most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">non-EEA companies, the biggest radio groups and the smaller national newspaper groups.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News International is not amongst the &#8220;Big Winners&#8221; but is placed is the &#8220;Smaller Winners&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">category along with the largest national newspaper groups, their subsidiaries and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regional-only newspaper groups.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref221" href="#footnote221">221</a></sup> It must be noted that this assessment was at that stage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the assumption that the prohibition on a News International purchase of Channel 5 would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remain and the ultimate outcome was more favourable for News International than that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contemplated at this time. Nevertheless, the assessment tends against any suggestion that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Government of the time was seeking specifically to benefit News International and is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consistent with its policy of deregulation for wider economic and consumer benefit.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-49"><a href="#para5-49" name="para5-49">5.49</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As has been discussed above, the 20% rule, as it applied to Channel 5 was not in the event</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">included in the draft bill, as a result of discussions with Mr Blair. On the subject of cross</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media ownership, the Secretaries of States&#8217; recommendation to reduce the system to its</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">essentials was accepted and no media plurality test was incorporated into the draft bill for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">application to cross media acquisitions.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref222" href="#footnote222">222</a></sup> This approach was consistent with the desire to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provide predictable rules for business and with the greatly relaxed approach to newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mergers set out in the draft Bill, the effect of which was summarised as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref223" href="#footnote223">223</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">applying post-acquisition only in cases where there is significant concern on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">competition or plurality grounds. Criminal sanctions will be removed. Final decisions,</span>

<p id="para-id-5-50"><a href="#para5-50" name="para5-50">5.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The absence of a plurality test generally applicable to media mergers in the draft bill became</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the subject of some controversy. At the pre-legislative scrutiny stage, the Joint Committee</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made 148 recommendations.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref224" href="#footnote224">224</a></sup> Amongst these, the Committee recommended the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">incorporation of a plurality test for media mergers to be incorporated into the general merger</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regime introduced by the Enterprise Act 2002 (and thus applicable to media mergers which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were also qualifying mergers for the purposes of that Act). They also expressed concerns</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the proposed exclusion of Channel 5 from the 20:20 rule and the lifting of the ban</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on foreign ownership.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref225" href="#footnote225">225</a></sup> The core recommendation about plurality incorporated a widely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">drafted test and read:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref226" href="#footnote226">226</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We recommend that the general merger regime, as introduced by the Enterprise</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Bill, be amended by the Communications Bill to permit the OFT and the Competition</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Commission to have regard to plurality, as well as the issue of substantial lessening</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of competition, in reaching decisions on media mergers. For these purposes, we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recommend that plurality be specified as a consideration in respect of which the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State may serve a public interest intervention notice and that plurality</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be defined as:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The public interest in &#8211; (i) the maintenance of a range of broadcast media owners</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and voices sufficient to satisfy a variety of tastes and interests; (ii) the promotion</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and maintenance of a plurality of TV, radio and other broadcast media owners,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">each of whom demonstrates a commitment to the impartial presentation of news</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and factual broadcast programming; and (ii) the promotion and maintenance, in all</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">media including newspapers, of a balanced and accurate presentation of news, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">free expression of opinion and a clear differentiation between the two&#8221;.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-51"><a href="#para5-51" name="para5-51">5.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCMS and DTI considered the Joint Committee&#8217;s recommendations, accepting most of them</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and they also considered the responses of interested parties to the draft Bill. On the question</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a media plurality test, they were unmoved by the Joint Committee&#8217;s recommendation.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A contemporary joint briefing produced by officials for Ms Jowell and Ms Hewitt succinctly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recorded their position:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref227" href="#footnote227">227</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;[The Government&#8217;s view is that the only way to guarantee sufficient levels of plurality</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on a cross-media basis is to set clear, specific limits on ownership through a number</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of key rules.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Since these rules &#8211; which will apply to all mergers &#8211; are directed at the same</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">objectives as a general plurality consideration, we do not see the need to provide</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">additionally for a general plurality test in the Enterprise Bill merger control regime].&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">There were also concerns that the proposed test would effectively impose a form of content</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation on newspapers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref228" href="#footnote228">228</a></sup> The Communications Bill, when it was introduced, did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">include a media plurality test.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-53"><a href="#para5-53" name="para5-53">5.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Puttnam was not prepared to let the matter rest and led a campaign for, amongst other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">things, a media plurality test, against the relaxation of the 20:20 rule in relation to Channel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">5, and against the lifting of the ban on foreign ownership. He met Ms Jowell on 11 June 2003</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when the position, on these issues, recorded the plurality test as being to the fore:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref229" href="#footnote229">229</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Lord Puttnam thought a plurality test would resolve his own concerns about foreign</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ownership and Channel 5. He accepted, however, that he couldn&#8217;t speak for anyone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">else. The SoS said she would be concerned about a double bind of ownership rules</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">plus plurality test, and was not convinced that the industry would buy it, given the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">uncertainty involved. Puttnam said his conversations with industry leaders suggested</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they were not unduly bothered by such uncertainty. He is not hung up about the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">precise wording &#8211; the extract from the PCC Code is deliberately provocative. SoS</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">agreed we&#8217;d look at his ideas and discuss with our lawyers.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-54"><a href="#para5-54" name="para5-54">5.54</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was some limited counter lobbying from the industry but the political tide was turning</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">against the Government.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref230" href="#footnote230">230</a></sup> As the Bill approached its first day of Lords Report, Ms Jowell</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Ms Hewitt wrote jointly to Mr Blair, informing him that the Government faced defeat on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the three issues which this sub-section of the report has focused upon: foreign ownership,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Channel 5, and a media merger plurality test. They invited him to agree to make a concession</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on a plurality test, it having been indicated to them both by the Conservatives and Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Puttnam that such a move would win their backing on foreign ownership and Channel 5.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The thinking behind recommending the concession reflected the increasingly deregulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">course which the policy had taken and was stated to be:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref231" href="#footnote231">231</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Until now we have resisted calls for a plurality test on the basis that our mix of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">content regulation and core ownership rules should protect plurality. In Parliament, it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">has argued that because the Bill is so deregulatory we should equip ourselves with the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">means of investigating further those rare cases where we have removed ownership</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rules but where some concerns remain. We can see the logic in this, although such a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">concession only makes sense if the wider liberalisation central to the Bill is retained.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-55"><a href="#para5-55" name="para5-55">5.55</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There then followed a period of internal policy debate about the form which a plurality test</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should take and, including amongst other things whether it should be a narrow test or a</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Andrew McIntosh repeated that at Report stage we would signal our concern about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">plurality in general and our intention to consider Puttnam&#8217;s plurality test amendment.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Puttnam said that would not be enough to satisfy him. He was clear that only the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">exact text of his amendment (as scrutinised by Lord Grabiner) would work for him.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">He also circulated a new, additional amendment that would prevent any removal of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ownership rules relating to Channel 5 until a plurality test had come into being.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Secretary of State asked for clarification that if we introduced a plurality test we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would withdraw his opposition to our proposals on Channel 5 ownership. He agreed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that if we can reach a common position on plurality he will not push the Channel 5</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">amendment &#8211; he would take his name off it and would encourage Lord McNally and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Lord Crickhowell to do the same. He will repeat this offer, making clear its conditional</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Puttnam explained that the Joint Scrutiny Committee&#8217;s proposed plurality test lay at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the heart of its conclusions and recommendations about media ownership. The committee</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regarded it as one of three non-negotiables and the test needed to be:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;...sufficient</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> look</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">question of the underlying rationale of the amendment he said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref238" href="#footnote238">238</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Much has been made in the past few weeks of the underlying rationale of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">amendment. I have heard it referred to as &#8220;the Murdoch clause&#8221;; it has even been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">described as something that attempts to demonise sections of the media. That is not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and never has been the case. The Secretary of State was entirely right in insisting that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Bill and the amendment were entirely &#8220;proprietor neutral&#8221;. It is more to do, as I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">see it, with attempting to make our democracy proprietor neutral.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-59"><a href="#para5-59" name="para5-59">5.59</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He later summarised the aim of his amendment as<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;...a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> move</span><span style="font-style:italic"> towards</span><span style="font-style:italic"> making</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Berlusconi-</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Taken to one possible logical conclusion, the text of the amendment could have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the effect of stopping broadcasters from being impartial and allowing them to have</span>

<p id="para-id-5-60"><a href="#para5-60" name="para5-60">5.60</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord McIntosh summarised the main points in favour of a plurality test: it would allow for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gradual dismantling of media ownership rules over time; it would be flexible enough to cope</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with changed circumstances (in this regard he posited the growth of Channel 5 to approach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that of Channel 3 in size and reach); and it would allow judgments on media mergers, based</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the particular circumstances of the case (in contrast to the cliff edge effect of the 20:20</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Rule).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref241" href="#footnote241">241</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-61"><a href="#para5-61" name="para5-61">5.61</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Turning to the test to be applied, Lord McIntosh promised that a plurality floor would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">maintained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref242" href="#footnote242">242</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It will be for Ministers to determine whether the merger causes sufficient plurality</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">concerns for it to be blocked, or for conditions to be attached. Similarly, the test must</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">also recognise that there is a minimum level of plurality which must be maintained.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Significant limitations on the circumstances in which the Secretary of State would, in practice,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intervene were signalled:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref243" href="#footnote243">243</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We propose that the power be wide enough to capture all media mergers, including</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cross-media mergers. We would intend as a matter of policy normally to apply the test</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in practice only to those areas where the current rules are being removed completely.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">This means that, usually, the Secretary of State would consider intervening on plurality</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">grounds only in the following areas: national newspapers with more than 20 per</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cent of the market/Channel 5; national newspapers with more than 20 per cent of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the market/national radio service, Channel 3; Channel 3/national radio; Channel 5/</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">national radio; and national radio/national radio.&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> (emphasis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> added)</span> .</span>

<p id="para-id-5-63"><a href="#para5-63" name="para5-63">5.63</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the delicate question as to the practical effect of the Government&#8217;s intended test, Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">McIntosh would give no specific guarantee:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref244" href="#footnote244">244</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, asked whether this test would &#8220;effectively rule out&#8221; a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">major national newspaper owning Channel 5. The answer is that the test will ensure</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the Secretary of State can investigate any merger which threatens plurality. It</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">will clearly prevent unacceptable levels of cross-media dominance. But it is inherent in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the nature of a test that one cannot predict the outcome in advance of any individual</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">case. It will be necessary to analyse and consider all the relevant circumstances at the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">time on a case-by-case basis.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-64"><a href="#para5-64" name="para5-64">5.64</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Guidance was intimated in order to afford industry some degree of certainty and, in particular,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to set out in more detail those areas whether the test would generally be applied and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">factors that would be considered. Wider application of the test in &#8220;extreme and rare&#8221; cases</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was, understandably, not ruled out.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref245" href="#footnote245">245</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-65"><a href="#para5-65" name="para5-65">5.65</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These assurances proved sufficient for Lord Puttnam who withdrew his amendment.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref246" href="#footnote246">246</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Subsequently, the amendment to the Enterprise Act 2002, effected by the Communications</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Act 2003, inserting the media plurality test, was in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref247" href="#footnote247">247</a></sup></span>

<h3>Reflections</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-67"><a href="#para5-67" name="para5-67">5.67</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence does not support an inference of an agreement between Mr Murdoch and Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Blair. Not only did Mr Blair flatly deny any such deal but the contemporary papers, discussed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in detail above, reveal very considerable thought, genuine debate and reasoned decision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">making during the development of the policy underpinning the 2003 Act.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-68"><a href="#para5-68" name="para5-68">5.68</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Blair&#8217;s approach to the 2003 Act was driven by the views which he expressed in his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence (as held at that time &#8211; they changed later) including his desire to deregulate and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to encourage foreign investment in what was a rapidly changing and globalising market. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach was congruent with, but not necessarily a product of, his strategy to foster better</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relations with some sections of the media than his predecessors had enjoyed.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-69"><a href="#para5-69" name="para5-69">5.69</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The amount of consultation and dialogue involved during the development of the policy was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">noteworthy. There was considerable industry lobbying. Some of this was not transparent.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">I make no criticism of those involved; standards of transparency were in keeping with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">times. Both on its own and when collected with other examples, the significance and value of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transparency is increasingly obvious.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-70"><a href="#para5-70" name="para5-70">5.70</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The views of large media companies were undoubtedly taken into account but so were those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of others with contrary views. The evidence has not demonstrated bias or unfair advantage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resulting from media lobbying. Insofar as media representations were preferred over</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">competing representations the documents show that it was the result of a proper weighing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the opposing arguments, and consistent with the deregulatory policies of the decision</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">makers.</span>
