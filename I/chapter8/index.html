<h1>CHAPTER 8<br/>CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The subject-matter of Module Three was the contacts and relationships between national</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers and politicians, and the conduct of each, considered in the overall context of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">culture, practices and ethics of the press. Pausing to take stock, it is first worth restating what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context led to the inclusion of this Module in the Inquiry&#8217;s terms of reference.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The questions the Inquiry looked at in Module Three were these: was there something amiss</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the relationship between the press and the politicians? And if so, was it connected to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">current state of press standards? Most importantly, was there a genuine issue of public trust</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and confidence here which ought to be addressed? Were politicians to any degree a &#8216;part of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the problem&#8217; of press standards and of public concern about them?</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The relationship between the politicians and the press is, as I said at the outset, part of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">vital lifeblood of democracy. It is also an unbalanced relationship in one important respect:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the politicians are directly answerable to the public for it. So in asking the Inquiry to reflect on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this matter, it was effectively being directed to the question of whether there has been some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">shortcoming in the democratic processes of accountability for the relationship.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is important to make that point clear because, in one sense, the politicians made the issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">straightforward. The cross-party consensus at the time the Inquiry was set up was, in itself,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at least a partial answer to the question of whether there was a legitimate issue of public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">confidence. The commissioning of a judge-led Inquiry, and particularly an Inquiry running</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in parallel with extensive criminal investigations, cannot be regarded simply as a matter of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">placing a complex and sensitive set of policy issues into a forensic context for the purposes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of gathering and analysing evidence for future decision making (although it was certainly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all of that). At some level, it must also be understood to be an acknowledgment that there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be value in considering the matter, from an independent and objective perspective,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">removed from the context of Government and Parliament where such matters are more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">usually considered.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">InconductingModuleThree,Ihavebeenverymindfuloftheresponsibilitytomaintainpolitical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">objectivity and of questions of public perception. The subject matter is both of real public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest and is also interesting to the public: the evidence ranged over important issues of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">accountability, and it is clear that the public took a close interest in what witnesses (including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some of the leading politicians of our time) had to say about them. In the circumstances,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have sought to ensure a very high level of transparency in all that has been undertaken.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This means that everyone can make their own minds up directly, while at the same time</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reflecting on the political commentary and the mediation of the press. I have also repeatedly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">emphasised the non-partisan context of the work of the Inquiry.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In contrast, the contemporaneous commentary on the evidence was vigorously partisan, as it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was fully entitled to be. Among the large number of thought-provoking questions about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship between the politicians and the press which were raised in the process, I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had to be highly selective, and so not lose sight of the remit set out in the Terms of Reference.</span>
<a name="page1428"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">My focus in these concluding pages is not on individual politicians or political parties. I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concentrated entirely on long-term patterns of behaviour as they might be perceived by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public, observing from the outside the relationship between the politicians and the press.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence contained many examples from which these patterns clearly emerge. No doubt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there is unlimited scope for debate and value-judgment about the relative contribution to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the pattern of one example rather than another. For my part, however, I do not intend to take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any part in that debate.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have also been conscious that politicians (and not only those in Government to whom I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">formally report) hold the future of this Report in their hands; it is they who must now be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">finally and fully responsible and accountable to the public for dealing with it. To that extent,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am bringing the story full circle. I have concluded that, in some ways, the conduct of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship between politicians and the press has been a part of the problem. Now, however,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that relationship has to hold the key to the solution.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Theproblemrevolvesaroundoneprincipalpublicconcern;putsimplyitisthattherelationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has become &#8216;too close&#8217;. Politicians have used that term themselves and the Inquiry has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explored what is meant by it. The definitions and explanations provided have not always</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been the same, nor, indeed, has been the public perception of this problem.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-10"><a href="#para1-10" name="para1-10">1.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of features have been mentioned. First, there is the power of proprietors and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">risk that it has, in itself, stifled political comment about the power of the press, contrary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the public interest. Second, there is the question about how politicians have conducted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">themselves in relation to that power in all its manifestations. Third, the sheer quantity of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meetings between senior editors, proprietors and politicians has raised concern about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perception that, on occasion, understandings could have been reached or deals struck well</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out of public sight.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-11"><a href="#para1-11" name="para1-11">1.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There have been further public concerns. They include first, the issue of failure by politicians</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to speak out in the face of the growing evidence of criminal wrong-doing and, secondly,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that personal relationships and friendships have been allowed to develop, with the risk that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate boundaries have become blurred and, potentially, led to errors of judgment.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-12"><a href="#para1-12" name="para1-12">1.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However the term &#8216;too close&#8217; is exactly defined, the question has boiled down to this issue:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have there been unaccountable exchanges in influence and favours, trading political support</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and advancement (or the avoidance of political damage) for policies which favour the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commercial interests of the press, however defined, or the abstention from policies which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would disfavour those interests? Less starkly, but no less important, are there aspects of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">close relationship between politicians and the press which should just very simply be less</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">close, or which the public should be able to know more about so that they can make their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">own minds up about it?</span>

<p id="para-id-1-13"><a href="#para1-13" name="para1-13">1.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Generally speaking, I have considered the issue on a chronological basis, taking the last five</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prime Ministers over three periods of time, corresponding with the periods of power of their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">respective parties, and examining their relationship with the press; and then by scrutinising</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the issue through the lens of a series of policy and legislative developments, culminating in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">close examination of the BSkyB bid. This last episode has been analysed in detail for a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of reasons. First, because of its currency and the quantity of evidence, both documentary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and oral, which was brought to bear on it. Second, the story allows a clear focus on a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of aspects of the relationship between the press and the politicians. Third, the evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">available, and the fact that the case involved a decision with a legal (and quasi-judicial)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dimension, makes it possible to analyse it forensically.</span>
<a name="page1429"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-1-14"><a href="#para1-14" name="para1-14">1.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Module Three has also addressed a number of issues in which the press themselves have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expressed a particular interest. These include &#8216;spin&#8217;, so-called anonymous briefings and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice of &#8216;feeding&#8217; favoured journalists with stories in return for an expectation of a certain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">type of treatment in the telling of those stories by the newspapers involved. These issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are not central to the work of the Inquiry for a number of reasons. On examination, some of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the matters of which complaint is made turn out to fall within the spectrum of what might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fairly be described as the rough and tumble of politics and political journalism. Some are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inevitably too impressionistic and partial to bear much analysis. And it is also problematic to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conceive of any practical recommendations which might be crafted to address these issues.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I do recognise, however, that there is a genuine issue of public perception and confidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">here, to which the Report can do some service if only by holding up a mirror.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-15"><a href="#para1-15" name="para1-15">1.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The principal focus of Module Three has been the relationship between politicians and News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">International. This has been inevitable. The Prime Minister, echoed by others, summed up</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the problem:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> all</span><span style="font-style:italic"> got</span><span style="font-style:italic"> too</span><span style="font-style:italic"> close</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> News</span><span style="font-style:italic"> International&#8217;</span> . Mr Murdoch&#8217;s titles still have the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">largest market share in the UK despite the demise of News of the World, and Mr Murdoch</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">himself has exercised enormous fascination in the public imagination over some 40 years. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been demonised in some quarters and lauded in others, to the extent that one might be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">entitled to observe that a moderate view about the man would be unorthodox. Moderate or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">otherwise, a balanced assessment is required for these purposes in the context of the specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues which arise under the Terms of Reference.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-16"><a href="#para1-16" name="para1-16">1.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The purpose, therefore, of this concluding Chapter of this Part of the Report is to draw</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the various strands together and so found an evidential basis and justification for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations that I feel it right to make. I first examine the relationships between the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press and politicians specifically from the perspective of the proprietors who gave evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">before the Inquiry: this will be achieved in fairly general terms, because Part I Chapters 2-4</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has already addressed these topics in detail, albeit specifically from the perspective of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians. I will then set out some general conclusions as to the ways in which the relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between politicians and the press seems to have fallen out of line with the public interest.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, I will draw some wider conclusions which will lead onto my recommendations.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. The proprietors</h2>

<h3>Rupert Murdoch</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Those who are expecting a series of revelatory insights into the career and personality of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rupert Murdoch will be disappointed by what follows. I say this for at least two reasons. First,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as those who have written biographies about him would no doubt explain, the time at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry&#8217;s disposal to investigate Mr Murdoch&#8217;s lengthy career was limited in comparison with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the breadth and depth of exploration necessary for such a subject. There was considerable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ground for Counsel to cover and, in addition to pursuing the wider interests of the Inquiry,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was important that Mr Murdoch was able to say what he wanted about the various issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that have cost his company so dear.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, the Inquiry remains constrained by the ongoing criminal investigations, at least as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regards those aspects of Mr Murdoch&#8217;s evidence which bore on Module One and the saga</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of phone hacking. Sir John Major made the point in evidence that what he considered to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the less than acceptable state of the culture, practices and ethics of the press is attributable</span>
<a name="page1430"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">to the acts and omissions of proprietors and editors.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> However, as I have already explained,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this is the sort of issue that criminal proceedings rightly preclude the Inquiry from exploring,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">save in very general terms, not least because the only conduit from the conduct of journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Mr Murdoch is the layers of editorial and other management that separated him from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">news room floor none of whom could be asked about the matter. This means that there are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear limits on the basis of the evidence I have heard to what I can say about Mr Murdoch&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">leadership and his responsibility, if any, for this aspect of the culture, practices and ethics of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are no similar inhibitions operating on me in relation to those aspects of Mr Murdoch&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence which covered Module Three issues, although I naturally bear in mind that an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enormous amount of evidential ground had to be covered in a relatively compressed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">timescale. Furthermore, the events in question covered a 31 year period (the acquisition of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Times and its associated titles was in January 1981) and Rupert Murdoch was 81 years of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">age when he testified. Notwithstanding that he is plainly extremely astute, some allowances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">need to be made for the fact that, over a two day period, he was being asked to give wide-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ranging evidence and being taken, in the course of that evidence, to documents which were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">numerous, complex and diverse. It is not necessarily unreasonable that he may not always</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have given direct answers to the questions posed, and was not always able to recall events.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is also necessary to reiterate that Mr Murdoch is the Chairman and CEO of a world-wide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media empire, and however dear to his heart newspapers may be as a whole, or The Sun</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper in particular, his time has to be rationed and certain responsibilities delegated.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Murdoch&#8217;s relationships with various British Prime Ministers have been considered in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">depth above, and in this Chapter, I come to the heart of the matter. He denied on several</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occasions that he made any express deals with politicians, and the available evidence does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not prove that he ever did. This, however, is not the end of the story.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This Report is not the place to comment on Mr Murdoch&#8217;s undeniable business acumen.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On any basis, I have absolutely no doubt that he is a newspaper man through and through,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that he has developed a serious and abiding interest in politics and current affairs. An</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">iconoclast in a number of respects, and certainly not an establishment figure, Mr Murdoch&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">position (which may be as the most powerful newspaper magnate in the English-speaking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">world, or at least one of them), has brought him into contact with all the leading politicians</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inhabiting that environment, from Australia to the USA. It is inevitable that he should get</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on better with some than others, but it is also clear from the evidence that he is a man who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enjoys political argument and debate with those who are at the centre of this universe.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If Mr Murdoch made no express deals with politicians within government, the question which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arises is whether he made any implied deals or reached tacit understandings with those who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">engaged with him. In this regard it is necessary to define terms carefully because there is a</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear danger of permitting a lack of precision in the question to suggest or indicate what the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">answer to it might be. Instead, it may be better simply to set out what inferences, if any, may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasonably be drawn from Mr Murdoch&#8217;s conduct over the years.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">All the politicians who gave evidence before the Inquiry said that Mr Murdoch exercised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">immense power and that this was almost palpable in their relations with him. Mr Blair spoke</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in terms of his acute awareness of the power that was associated with him.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> This is not to</span>

<a name="page1431"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">say that Mr Murdoch set out to wield power or that his personal manner was other than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">amicable and respectful in his dealings with politicians. But it is to say that he must have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aware of how he was being perceived by his interlocutors; to suggest otherwise would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to suggest that Mr Murdoch knows little about human nature and lacks basic insight, which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could not, of course, be further from the truth.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rupert Murdoch accepted that The Sun broadly reflected his worldview.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> His editors would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not need to ask him for his opinion on any particular topic; they would know his thinking on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the issues of the day in general terms, and could work out what it would be likely to be in any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specific instance. Some have likened this process to the workings or metaphorical radiations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Sun King, but, in fact, it is no more than basic common sense. Editors at The Sun, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">probably also the News of the World, could form a pretty good idea of what their proprietor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wanted without having to ask. It follows from this that, for example, the position The Sun</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">took in relation to Lord Kinnock&#8217;s personality and policies through the 1980s and right up to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the general election of 1992 was consistent with Mr Murdoch&#8217;s assessment of the man, even</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if the proprietor did not necessarily encourage all his paper&#8217;s methods and rhetoric.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is the &#8216;without having to ask&#8217; which is especially important here. Sometimes the very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">greatest power is exercised without having to ask, because to ask would be to state the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">blindingly obvious and thereby diminish the very power which is being displayed. Just as Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch&#8217;s editors knew the basic ground-rules, so did politicians. The language of trades</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and deals is far too crude in this context. In their discussions with him, whether directly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or by proxy, politicians knew that the prize was personal and political support in his mass</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circulation newspapers. The value or effect of such support may have been exaggerated, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it has been treated as having real political value nonetheless.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Turning the tables round, as it were, Mr Murdoch was also well aware that political support</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was what his interlocutors were seeking.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> Equally, politicians were well aware that &#8216;taking on&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Murdoch would be likely to lead to a rupture in support, a metaphorical declaration of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">war on his titles with the inevitable backlash that would follow. What might count as taking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">him on would have to be seen from Mr Murdoch&#8217;s point of view, and in the context of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">continuing and complex relationship. Mr Murdoch knew this too.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These factors, taken together, would be likely to lead to an appreciation of the consequences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both of disturbing the status quo as regards the regulation of the press and, more broadly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">speaking, of adopting policies which would damage Mr Murdoch&#8217;s commercial interests.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Politicians&#8217; interests, in other words, would find themselves highly aligned with Mr Murdoch&#8217;s.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-12"><a href="#para2-12" name="para2-12">2.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Put in these terms, the influence exercised by Mr Murdoch is more about what did not happen</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">than what did. To reiterate: a case by case examination of the policies which were introduced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">over this long period fails to demonstrate that politicians compromised themselves or their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">policies to favour Mr Murdoch&#8217;s business interests directly. Where a decision pleased Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch, there would always be other public-policy reasons for it. At least one administration</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">introduced many policies to which, by any stretch of the imagination, Mr Murdoch would not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been well disposed. But no government addressed the issue of press regulation, nor of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concentration of ownership.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Another important factor is that Mr Murdoch fully understood the value of personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interactions, the value of the face-to-face meeting. His (self-invited) lunch with Baroness</span>

<a name="page1432"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">Thatcher on 4 January 1981 exemplifies this point in microcosm. Mr Murdoch was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessarily expecting any favours from Baroness Thatcher but he was investing in her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nonetheless, seeking to impress on her his personal qualities as a risk-seeking entrepreneur</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who shared political affiliations with the Prime Minister and, although he never made the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argument explicitly, why he should be regarded as the favoured bidder for The Times. There</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is no evidence that Baroness Thatcher sought in turn to persuade her Secretary of State of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Murdoch&#8217;s qualities, but had there been a conversation between the two of them Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch had the comfort of knowing that he had taken the opportunity of advancing his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">own case. In any event, if the lunch had been known about at the time, that itself would have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been significant. Suffice to say, Mr Murdoch well understands the value of &#8216;less is more&#8217;.</span>

<h3>Viscount Rothermere</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-14"><a href="#para2-14" name="para2-14">2.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am grateful for the evidence Viscount Rothermere provided to the Inquiry, but for these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">purposes it is possible to address it quite briefly. He recognised the power wielded by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press, including by his own titles, but an assessment of his evidence overall does not suggest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this was a power which he was particularly keen to wield; he left it to others to do so.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Viscount Rothermere was concerned to explain the distinction he said he made in his own</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mind between overt campaigning activity on a matter of general public interest, or on issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of commercial concern to his newspaper, which in his view should take place with Ministers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and officials on the record,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> and social interactions with politicians where, as he put it, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might be seen as not very good manners to raise particular problems.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> This distinction was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">encapsulated in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t &#8211; I think that if I see a politician and they want to talk about general</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">politics and they want to talk about &#8211; they want to explain their views and I want a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">general understanding of what&#8217;s going on, then that&#8217;s appropriate in one scenario.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">If I have specific issues that I wish them to understand over something like the EU</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">privacy directive or local television, I think that&#8217;s best done in a business environment,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">where everything is on the record. Frankly, I think it&#8217;s the &#8211; it protects them and it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">protects me from insinuations of undue access. That&#8217;s how I operate, anyway. Or try</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to operate.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-16"><a href="#para2-16" name="para2-16">2.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This was straightforward evidence, both in its ethical compass and its recognition of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">problems of public perception which attach to both parties to these interchanges: the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;<span style="font-style:italic"> insinuations</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> undue</span><span style="font-style:italic"> access&#8217;</span> was Viscount Rothermere&#8217;s pungent turn of phrase and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identified the very core of the problem.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-17"><a href="#para2-17" name="para2-17">2.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Viscount Rothermere also explained that, on occasion, he was at the receiving end of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">representations of a different sort from politicians discontented with their coverage in the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Daily Mail in particular. He explained that he saw it as his role, when appropriate, to draw</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these complaints to the attention of his editor:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Certainly, when I&#8217;ve had meetings with politicians, they have expressed &#8211; of all</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">parties &#8211; expressed unhappiness with some of the coverage in the newspaper. Largely,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I refer them back to Paul Dacre, but if there is an instance which I feel justifies merit,</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">into it and talk to that politician to seek out the truth. So if they say that we&#8217;ve run</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">something which is blatantly untrue, and that is probably &#8211; I won&#8217;t get involved on a</span>

<h3>Aidan Barclay</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-18"><a href="#para2-18" name="para2-18">2.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Barclay gave evidence to the Inquiry in his capacity as Chairman of Telegraph Media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Group Ltd, a position which he has occupied since July 2004.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> The Barclay family own a range</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of other business enterprises including other print titles, and the media as a whole is perhaps</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a less important part of their undertakings than some of the other proprietors from whom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry has heard.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-19"><a href="#para2-19" name="para2-19">2.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Aidan Barclay explained that it is his practice to accord complete editorial freedom to his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">titles.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> The Telegraph titles support the Conservative Party at general elections but regularly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criticise Conservative Governments and politicians.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup> Mr Barclay made it clear that he does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not ask politicians for favours, and none are returned; his discussions with politicians are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">largely of a general political and economic nature.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup> His SMS text message communications</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with David Cameron, particularly in May 2010, are addressed elsewhere but bear out his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence in this respect. No doubt Mr Barclay&#8217;s principal concern is the macro-economic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">environment in which his wide-ranging business interests will inhabit.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-20"><a href="#para2-20" name="para2-20">2.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Barclay&#8217;s evidence as to his various dealings with the last three Prime Ministers is as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;I have known each of the last three Prime Ministers. My relationships with each of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">them have been cordial and sporadic: I would not describe them as particularly close.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I saw Tony Blair on a number of occasions, and if my memory serves on almost every</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">occasion(otherthandinner)JonathanPowellwasinattendance.Asiswidelyrecorded,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mr Blair&#8217;s approach to such meetings was relaxed and social. He was interested in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the press but I do not recall him ever raising specific editorial matters with me, or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">suggesting that the Telegraph titles might adopt a different political stance.&#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I had a number of meetings with Gordon Brown when he was Prime Minister. He was,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as is well known, interested in the granular detail of economic policy and we spoke</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">often about economic theories and the state of British business. I saw him more than</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">keen to get my views on the impact on business, and I would sometimes send him</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">articles and books I thought he should see. He was also Prime Minister when the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">scandal of MPs&#8217; expenses broke, and he must have raised this with me in general</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">terms; but as with Mr Blair I do not recall him ever asking me to intervene in editorial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">matters as he was aware of my own views on editorial independence.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Prime Minister has a background in the media and I have always found him to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">knowledgeable about, and interested in, the way the newspaper industry works and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is developing. Like his predecessors, he has also always been interested in general</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">economic and business discussion. Again I do not recall that he has ever asked me to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interfere in matters of editorial policy.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Each of the three Prime Ministers I have had dealings with have obviously understood</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from the outset the broad political approach of the newspaper. None has asked me</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to change that approach.&#8217;</span>

<h3>Richard Desmond</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-21"><a href="#para2-21" name="para2-21">2.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Desmond has already been discussed in some detail in the Report. In this short section I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">shall focus on his dealings with politicians.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-22"><a href="#para2-22" name="para2-22">2.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Desmond presented himself as quintessentially a business man rather than a &#8216;newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">man&#8217;: newspapers are a strictly business, rather than an emotional, undertaking. In his written</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence to the Inquiry he explained his approach to editorial freedom and the direction of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political support of his newspapers:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;... all editorial decisions are left to the Editors. The best example I can recall is when</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Peter Hill was the editor of the Daily Express, he wanted the newspaper to stop</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">supporting the Labour Party and back the Conservative Party. I got on well with Tony</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Blair and I felt bad for letting him down. However, at the end of the day, it was the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Editor&#8217;s decision and the paper trusted his political allegiance [sic]&#8217;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-23"><a href="#para2-23" name="para2-23">2.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Desmond was asked to amplify on this in his oral evidence. As he explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;I&#8217;m not a &#8211; you know, I remember meeting Mr Blair for the first time when we bought</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the papers. He was very nice, we talked about &#8211; fortunately, we talked about music</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and drums, which is my passion, and as we walked out of the door, he said to me,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, who do you support then?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Pardon?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Who are you, left, right,</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you know, one of us?&#8221; I said &#8220;Honestly, mate, I&#8217;m not really interested in politics&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">And he said to me, &#8220;You will be&#8221;, and interestingly on my way back to the office I got</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hijacked by Porter who said, &#8220;What are you? Are you a Tory or a socialist?&#8221; I said he</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">seems a nice fellow, Blair, so I was a socialist.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. We&#8217;ve heard from Mr Hill that the paper changed direction, perhaps re-entered its</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">natural habitat before 2005.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">A. Yes.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yeah, I felt that I betrayed Tony, as a mate. I felt he was a good bloke, I thought</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he was doing a good job, I liked him. You know, he came to my house, I went to his</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">house or flat or whatever you want to call it. I thought he was a good guy. So I felt on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a personal level bad, but at the end of the day Peter Hill runs the editorial of the paper</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and that was the decision that he made.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. And it&#8217;s a decision, therefore, which from my understanding of what you just told</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">us that you didn&#8217;t oppose. Because you could have overruled it, it could be said?</span>

<h3>Evgeny Lebedev</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-24"><a href="#para2-24" name="para2-24">2.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Lebedev brought another perspective to the Inquiry through his evidence as joint owner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with his father of the three Independent titles and the London Evening Standard, although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his background is obviously different from that of Mr Murdoch on the one hand and Viscount</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rothermere on the other. He told the Inquiry that he did not set the editorial direction of his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">papers, but left his editors to do so unimpeded. Although he enjoys personal friendships with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">senior politicians such as Boris Johnson,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup> and spoke of the symbiotic relationship between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists and politicians, Mr Lebedev was clear that he had never been asked for political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">support from a politician.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup> He said that politicians discussed matters of policy with him not in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">order to encourage or secure political support for them but solely so that he as a newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proprietor had the benefit of a personal explanation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup> However, in answer to a follow-up</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question Mr Lebedev did impliedly accept that the distinction between the benefit of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal explanation on the one hand and assessing whether a particular policy should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">supported on the other may be quite a fine one:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: So part of the value is that you get a personal explanation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">of why &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">A. Yes, exactly, absolutely.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: &#8211; a particular idea is good and, although unstated, should</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be supported?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes, although, as I mentioned before, it will still be left up to the editor of whether</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the policy is supported or not.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-25"><a href="#para2-25" name="para2-25">2.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Lebedev sought to distance himself from the type of newspaper proprietor who he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">believed might seek to influence policy.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup> It is interesting to observe that, from his viewpoint</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a newspaper proprietor, it was an opinion which he firmly held, no doubt alive to the risks</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">which he felt were capable of arising from the complex and shifting dynamic which exists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between proprietors and politicians: as he put it,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;because</span><span style="font-style:italic"> we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> occupy</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> same</span><span style="font-style:italic"> sphere</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, Mr Lebedev offered an interesting insight, bearing in mind the perspective of his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Russian background, into the constitutional importance of a free press:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, I just think that &#8211; okay. Going back to the question of politicians meeting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proprietors, I think we are in danger of building a society where every institution,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">every element of democracy becomes too feeble. So politicians become too feeble,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">police becomes too feeble, the country itself becomes too feeble. If the press also</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">becomes feeble, then what we get is what I would call a tyranny of consensus, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">everyone is afraid or thinks twice or has to check twice before a step they make, a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">comment they make, and I think one of the extraordinary things about this country</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is a very robust and diverse press, and I think that has to be protected. Without, of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">course &#8211; those who have created &#8211; who have committed crimes, sorry, should be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">punished and punished according to the law. But I think the robustness of the press in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this country should be protected because otherwise, as I mentioned earlier, I&#8217;ve been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recently going on trips to countries where there is no freedom of the press. I&#8217;ve just</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">come back from Ethiopia and there are journalists there that have been charged with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">terrorism, with genocide. Some might be put to death. Countries like that, when you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">visit them and you see what the lack of the freedom of the press has on the effects on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the government and the state, and also, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, I come from &#8211; I was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">born in the Soviet Union, I come from Russia, and I can see the effects of not having a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">free press is having on Russia.&#8221;</span>

<h3>Reflections on the proprietors</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-27"><a href="#para2-27" name="para2-27">2.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It may be appropriate at this point to make brief and general observations about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">participation of the proprietors in the work of the Inquiry and indeed in the conclusions and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations of this Report. It is of the essence of press freedom as discussed in Part B</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of this Report that (consistently with safeguarding the public interest in a plural and diverse</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press) anyone with the means and motivations to do so may own and run a printing press.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The fact that the proprietors of our national titles can view themselves on a continuum of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one sort, in the digital age, with the humblest blogger or tweeter does not alter the fact they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occupy, by virtue of their role, a fundamentally important place in UK public life, and perform</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a vital public service in the contribution they make to a vigorous and thriving democracy.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-28"><a href="#para2-28" name="para2-28">2.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As discussed below, although I have reached the conclusion that, in some respects, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship between individual newspaper proprietors and senior politicians has not been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wholly beneficial from the point of view of the public, I do not consider that the principal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibility for remedying that situation lies with the proprietors. The response that I invite</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from newspaper proprietors to this Report lies in a different direction.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-29"><a href="#para2-29" name="para2-29">2.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The culture, practices and ethics of individual press organisations, and the contribution that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">each one makes to the culture, practices and ethics of the press viewed as a whole, are matters</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on which individual proprietors are uniquely placed to exercise personal influence in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest. This does not, in any way, suggest interference with editorial independence or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the opinions or content that their titles are free to publish. I am referring instead to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way that any important business contributor to national life and culture will want his or her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">business to make that contribution, and to operate in ways that command public respect and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">admiration, enhance the reputation of the business and, in this case, the press generally and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their titles in particular. The more that the public trust the press, the greater the chance that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they will partake more freely and to a greater extent in the variety that different titles offer.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref22" name="footnote22" title="Go back to footnote reference 22 in the text">22</a>.  pp27-28, lines 16-18, <em>ibid</em></p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1437"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-2-30"><a href="#para2-30" name="para2-30">2.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have noted the support which national newspaper proprietors have expressed for a new</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system of press standards which restores public trust and confidence in, and the reputation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of, the industry by offering an unequivocal demonstration to the public that the press is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">committed to the standards of the best, to eradicating the causes of past failures and to real</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ambition about the way things will be seen to be done in future.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-31"><a href="#para2-31" name="para2-31">2.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I hope, therefore, that in response to this Report and however lively the debate and analysis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">freely playing out in the pages of their titles, newspaper proprietors will continue to play</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an open and public-spirited role in embracing the need for a system of press accountability</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that inspires public confidence. I have no doubt that they are able to set the tone within</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and beyond their organisations and I hope that they will feel able to do so. From the point</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of view of the readership and the wider public, there has perhaps never been such a clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">need for leadership within the industry both in relation to regulation and issues of internal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">governance.</span>

<a name="section3"></a>
<h2>3.  &#8216;Too close&#8217; a relationship</h2>

<h3>Generic conclusions</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having tested and examined the proposition that the relationship between politicians and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press has become too close, including through the historical and current perspectives</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of our last five Prime Ministers, the thoughts of contemporary politicians, and the series of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;case studies&#8217; which have been chosen (or, more precisely, simply presented themselves) to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exemplify the nature and character of this relationship, it is now appropriate to draw the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strands together and express some conclusions of a general nature.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In this part of the Report it is the generic nature of these conclusions which is important, not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the specifics of the relationship between any individual Prime Minister and any individual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper proprietor. I have already set out my conclusions in particular cases, and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence which in my view supports each conclusion, citing chapter and verse in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">witness statements and the transcripts. Almost invariably, I have not relied simply on what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commentatorsandotherobservershavesaid oropined(although someofthesecontributions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been full of insight); instead, my conclusions have been based on what the proprietors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the politicians themselves have told me.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For the purposes of these high-level conclusions I believe that it is unnecessary to set out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other than one or two isolated examples of the supporting evidence which is to be found in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the main body of the Report: indeed, it would be invidious to do so, given that the scale of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the available evidence would force me to be selective, and it might then be wondered why</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have cited evidence in relation to one politician but not another. However, my findings do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have to be reasoned and supported by evidence, and I have decided to place links to all of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant evidence in Appendix 5 to the Report.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I should also explain that, pursuant to my obligation to act fairly under the Inquiry Rules</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2006, in particular Rules 13-15, I have given the leaders of the three main parties in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">UK<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup> advance notice of these generic conclusions, which were then at a provisional stage of</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref23" name="footnote23" title="Go back to footnote reference 23 in the text">23</a>.  Part K, Chapter 7</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref24" name="footnote24" title="Go back to footnote reference 24 in the text">24</a>.  I did not write to the leaders of the national parties of government and opposition in the UK devolvedadministrations in this way because, as I make clear in this Report, in my opinion the conduct of politicians of devolvedgovernment cannot reasonably be considered as part of the historical UK national pattern with which my genericconclusions are concerned</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1438"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">formulation, as well as notice of the supporting evidence. No-one has sought to take issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with what I then called my &#8216;generic criticisms&#8217; which now follow.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In my view, the evidence clearly demonstrates that the political parties of UK national</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">government and of UK official opposition<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup> have had or developed too close a relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the press. This assessment relates to the period of the last thirty to thirty-five years but is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">likely, as has been suggested, to have been much longer than that. Although this relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has fluctuated over time, the evidence suggests there has been a perceptible increase in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proximity of the relationship over this period. I do not believe this has been in the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest. I do not seek to attribute or apportion blame any more specifically than that.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The relationship between the press and the politicians has been too close in the following</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principalrespects.First,inmyview(andasmanyhavesaid)politicianshavespentasurprisingly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">large amount of time, attention and resource on this relationship in comparison to, and at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the expense of, other legitimate claims in relation to their conduct of public affairs. Second,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in conducting their relationship with the press, politicians have not always maintained, with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adequate rigour, appropriate boundaries between the conduct of public affairs and their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private or personal interests. Third, politicians have failed to conduct their relationship with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press with sufficient transparency and accountability from the point of view of the public.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Again, it would be invidious, and unnecessary, for me to be any more specific than this in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidencing these conclusions.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I therefore conclude that politicians have conducted themselves in a way that I do consider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has not served the public interest, so as:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) to place themselves in a position in which they risked becoming vulnerable to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unaccountable influences in a manner which was, at least, potentially in conflict with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their responsibilities in relation to the conduct of public affairs;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) to miss a number of clear opportunities decisively to address (and persistently fail to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">respond more generally to) public concern about, the culture practices and ethics of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) to seek to control (if not manipulate) the supply of news and information to the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in return for expected or hoped-for favourable treatment by sections of the press,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">beyond that which is appropriate or an inevitable by product of politics in a 24-7 media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">age, but to a degree and by means other than the fair and reasonable partisan conduct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of public debate.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In making the first and second of these points I should not be interpreted as concluding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that politicians have made express or implied &#8216;deals&#8217; with press proprietors in a manner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contrary to the public interest. Rather, I have concluded that a combination of these factors</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">has contributed to a lessening of public confidence in the conduct of public affairs, by giving</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rise to legitimate perceptions and concerns that politicians and the press have traded power</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and influence in ways which are contrary to the public interest and out of public sight. These</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perceptions and concerns are inevitably particularly acute in relation to the conduct by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians of public policy issues in relation to the press itself.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref25" name="footnote25" title="Go back to footnote reference 25 in the text">25</a>.  I am, of course, conscious of the limited extent to which the Liberal Democrat party (and its predecessors) have, inpractice, fitted within that description</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1439"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As I have already pointed out, the evidence upon which I rely is available in Appendix 5 to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Report. I content myself by citing just one piece of evidence from an experienced politician.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Rt Hon Lord Patten of Barnes CH put it this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think major political parties, and particularly their leaders over the last 20 or 25</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">years, have often demeaned themselves by the extent to which they&#8217;ve paid court on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proprietors and editors. Of course I&#8217;m in favour of talking to editors and journalists</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but I&#8217;m not in favour of grovelling, and I think that politicians have very often laboured</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">under &#8211; again, I&#8217;m reminded of something I said by the documents you asked me to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">look at. I think that politicians have allowed themselves to be kidded by editors and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proprietors that editors and proprietors determine the fate of politicians.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-10"><a href="#para3-10" name="para3-10">3.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In concluding that the relationship has become too close, I bear in mind that this has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acknowledged by many of our leading contemporary politicians themselves, but in different</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ways and to different degrees. I also bear in mind and fully recognise that the overwhelming</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">majority of close interactions between politicians and the press are not only entirely healthy,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but an essential part of democratic life. It is important therefore to set out some of the wider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context to my generic conclusions before turning to thoughts for the future, both to explain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what I mean by those conclusions, and, just as important, to be clear about the aspects of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship which I consider to be entirely outside the scope of my criticisms.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-11"><a href="#para3-11" name="para3-11">3.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In doing so, I turn first to two distinct aspects of the problem I have identified, before stepping</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">back to consider some wider context.</span>

<h3>Image and &#8216;spin&#8217;</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-12"><a href="#para3-12" name="para3-12">3.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The acknowledgement that relationships have become too close is not just one about public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perceptions (whatever the reality) that covert deals have or might have been done. To some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extent the closeness has simply been a matter of politicians spending too much time and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attention on the press, perhaps worrying too much about the fleeting minutiae of image and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">presentation in a way which is not proportionate to the substance of national politics. To that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extent, this Report need do little more than amplify the message that this is, in itself, conduct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which demonstrably undermines public trust and confidence.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-13"><a href="#para3-13" name="para3-13">3.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In doing so, when viewing the matter from their perspective, it is impossible not to have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considerable sympathy with the politicians. In a context of declining public engagement with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and confidence in the national political process, the most natural thing in the world is to try</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to improve the situation with attractive and engaging communications strategies, trying to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">harness the power of the media to tell better and brighter narratives, trying to contain the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">power of the media to corrode public opinion or, in other words, simply getting the message</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">across more successfully. But it is a strategy which carries within it the very obvious risk of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being counter-productive.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-14"><a href="#para3-14" name="para3-14">3.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The presentation of politics is vital to a healthy democracy, but the politics of presentation can</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">themselves foster cynicism, disengagement and public mistrust. The ubiquity and slickness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of modern communications is daily life for all of us, and the public is highly sophisticated in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">filtering and interpreting it. Where political content is concerned, people are especially wary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and sceptical. I make allowance for the degree to which the media themselves may have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">over-zealous in promoting public distrust of politicians: from one perspective, &#8216;spin&#8217; is just the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out-manoeuvring of unfair and corrosive press criticism. Nevertheless, the perception of the</span>

<a name="page1440"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">politician as salesman, to be treated with circumspection by the wise, is an abiding obstacle</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to public trust and confidence.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-15"><a href="#para3-15" name="para3-15">3.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is a lesson which many politicians may already be learning. A number of important steps</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have already been taken in the right direction. These include progress on the approach to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">government communications since the Phillis Report,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup> in which Sir Robert Phillis analysed the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">state of public confidence in the relationship between the politicians and the press as it stood</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in 2003. Credit must be given for the measures put in place to secure more straightforward</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">communications strategies which the public can better understand.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-16"><a href="#para3-16" name="para3-16">3.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is striking too, however, how much of Sir Robert&#8217;s advice bears repetition. Of his seven</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">key principles for modern government communications, three in particular remain highly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant today, and relevant to the conduct of all political relationships with the press and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not merely those of governments. These are, first, the importance of politicians engaging</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in more unmediated communications with the public; secondly, staying on the right side</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the dividing line between the positive presentation of policies and achievements on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one hand and misleading spin on the other; and thirdly, the use of all relevant channels of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">communication rather than excessively emphasising national press and broadcasters.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-17"><a href="#para3-17" name="para3-17">3.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further progress in the direction of a more straightforward relationship between politicians</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and press is likely, in itself, to reap benefits in improved public confidence. That conclusion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">speaks for itself.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-18"><a href="#para3-18" name="para3-18">3.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In a small number of specific respects, however, I have concluded that simply setting out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the criticisms in writing (as I have done) will not, on its own, be sufficient to secure further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">improvement. I return to this in the recommendations at the end of this Chapter.</span>
<h3>The press as lobbyists</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-19"><a href="#para3-19" name="para3-19">3.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This Part of the Report has drawn attention to a number of ways in which the press has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exercised political influence, in other words engaged in lobbying. There have been those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in positions of leadership of the press who have shown themselves to be exceptionally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dedicated, powerful and effective political lobbyists in the cause of their own (predominantly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commercial, but also wider) interests. The fact that lobbying is pursued through the medium</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of personal relationships, and at an intuitive level, is part of its effectiveness. The lobbying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may be powerful exactly because it need not be crudely articulated.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-20"><a href="#para3-20" name="para3-20">3.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Here, it is critical to differentiate lobbying from campaigning. The press undertakes many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">campaigningactivities,editoriallyandotherwise,toexcellenteffect.Theseincludeinvestigative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">campaigns and campaigns on matters which have captured the public imagination, such</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">as &#8216;Help for Heroes&#8217;. They include all sorts of campaigns on political issues, including party</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political campaigns and electioneering. All of this is the very stuff of journalism and part of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the important contribution the press makes to our public life.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-21"><a href="#para3-21" name="para3-21">3.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The press also campaigns on particular subjects on the basis that it represents to governments</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the views of its readers and argues for them. The readership of national titles, however, is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sometimes more sceptical and diverse in its views than the editorial stance of the title might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggest; the sophistication of readers and consumers of media has never been greater. Nor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can the antennae of editors, however finely tuned and however much apparently validated</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref27" name="footnote27" title="Go back to footnote reference 27 in the text">27</a>.  http://www.ppa.co.uk/legal-and-public-affairs/ppa-responses-and-evidence/~/media/Documents/Legal/Consultations/Lords%20Communications%20Committee/final_report.ashx</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1441"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">through the public inboxes of their titles, substitute for democratic process or what politicians</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">learn from their constituents.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-22"><a href="#para3-22" name="para3-22">3.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It may be, as witnesses such as the Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke MP have observed, that press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">campaigning activities in areas such as criminal justice and immigration have, over the years,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seemed to carry more weight in political circles than they may have strictly merited as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matter of the evidence of public opinion or, more importantly still, as a matter of empirical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence and of proportion. But, rightly or wrongly, such campaigning will always be the stuff</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of politics.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-23"><a href="#para3-23" name="para3-23">3.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lobbying, in this context, is very different. Here I refer to activities designed to promote</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the self-interest of the press not only to increase readership and sales but more basically</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also as a matter of commercial self-interest. This is not just about their individual titles and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisations but also about the media or the press in general, including matters of regulation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and accountability.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-24"><a href="#para3-24" name="para3-24">3.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of course, as advocates for their own commercial interests, the press are in some respects</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in no different a position from other major commercial organisations or sectors, capable of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exerting power and influence over public policy and I am well aware that very much broader</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">questions about political lobbying do, from time to time, rise up the political agenda. These</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues cannot be part of this Report.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-25"><a href="#para3-25" name="para3-25">3.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nor do I consider any of the &#8216;self-interested&#8217; lobbying activities of the press to be an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate matter for press regulation. Media companies should not be criticised for, or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">restrained from, lawfully advocating their private interests with all the considerable skill</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and resource at their command, and at the highest levels to which they can (and do) secure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">access. The dedication and resourcefulness of press organisations as lobbyists has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">vividly illustrated for the Inquiry in the person of Mr Michel.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup> There is no doubting the sheer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hard work and professionalism of press lobbyists and I have no reason to believe that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Michel is an isolated phenomenon in this respect.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-26"><a href="#para3-26" name="para3-26">3.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is an important exception to the principle of unrestrained advocacy, and it relates to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the openness and formality required in the context of quasi-judicial decision-making. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exception applies just as much to any other commercial or campaigning organisation as it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does to the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-27"><a href="#para3-27" name="para3-27">3.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Havingsaidthat,Iamclearthatitis,moregenerally,entirelytheresponsibilityofthepoliticians</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who are the object of lobbying to judge how far and in what way they consider it to be in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest for them to respond. As I have said, the relationship is not a symmetrical one.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The politicians have responsibilities to the public who elected them. Lobbyists do not.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-28"><a href="#para3-28" name="para3-28">3.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One of the chief responsibilities of politicians is to bear in mind that while a free and healthy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press is certainly in the public interest, that does not mean that everything which is in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(commercial or wider) interests of any individual press organisation, or even of the industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a whole, will itself necessarily be in the public interest. The matter must be looked at in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">round, taking all relevant considerations into account. I make that clear because, in listening</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the evidence, I have noted the way in which the rhetoric of public interest tends to become</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">elided with the self-interest of the press. No doubt other sectors also routinely appeal to</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref28" name="footnote28" title="Go back to footnote reference 28 in the text">28</a>.  I appreciate that other lobbyists might have other potential tools of persuasion in their possession; the megaphone(which is the tool available to the press), however, is undeniably extremely powerful and, therefore, justifiesconsideration in its own right</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref29" name="footnote29" title="Go back to footnote reference 29 in the text">29</a>.  Part I Chapter 6 above</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1442"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">a sense of the public interest in the health of their enterprises and the contribution they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">make to general quality of life, prosperity and well being. Perhaps the press do so especially</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">insistently. It is politicians&#8217; job to test such claims on a case by case basis.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-29"><a href="#para3-29" name="para3-29">3.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, there are particular temptations and vulnerabilities for politicians in connection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with lobbying from the press. First, the press hold the powerful weapons of a public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">megaphone and extensive, behind the scenes access. Second, there is the direct influence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the press exercises over public communications about the relationship itself. This has a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal dimension which can be and has been very striking.</span>

<h3>The personal dimension</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-30"><a href="#para3-30" name="para3-30">3.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Free communication at a personal level between press and politicians is vital for healthy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">democracy. It is how the public is kept informed, both of the detail of current affairs and of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the large scale issues of politics, policy and citizenship. It fosters public engagement in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">debated issues of the day, civic responsibility, responsive government and allows power to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be held to account in the public interest. Face to face communication can be among the most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">powerful and effective, and is therefore of very real importance.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-31"><a href="#para3-31" name="para3-31">3.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At the same time, as politicians and journalists are constantly thrown together or seek</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">each other out, often in informal or social contexts, personal relationships can develop into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">friendship; that is, of course, often the case when people share time, professional interests</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and backgrounds.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-32"><a href="#para3-32" name="para3-32">3.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In this context, the relationship between national politicians and the national print press has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some distinctive qualities of its own. Whereas the broadcast media are subject to constraints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of political neutrality, balance and impartiality, the free partisanship of newspapers is, by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contrast, of their essence. They foster a form of political debate which is noisy, polemical and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">critical, and which is rightly highly valued as part of the UK&#8217;s heritage. They offer a choice of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different world views and different values, among which readers can make their choice, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the variety of which promotes richness of perspective and public debate. What the national</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press uniquely offers the politician, therefore, is attractively packaged, and actively mediated,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political partisanship.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-33"><a href="#para3-33" name="para3-33">3.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That in turn means that political/press relationships tend to have a focused bilateral quality,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in which each party has something the other wants. This motivates politicians to get a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">quantifiable outcome from their investment in relationships with journalists. It may be in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terms of new information, political and policy support, or the enhancement of personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reputation and profile. It also motivates the press, perhaps to try for exclusive access, or for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">something else tangible.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-34"><a href="#para3-34" name="para3-34">3.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This distinctive relationship is full of vigour, and a life-force which gives it the capacity to evolve</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in response to changing times. It is visibly still evolving and changing today, largely as a result</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the proliferation of new media. That gives politicians new opportunities to communicate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the public in alternative, and highly personal ways; some politicians have emerged as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gifted bloggers with attentive and enthusiastic readerships, others have made the use of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Twitter very much their own. These constitute new, lively fora of political debate in their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">own right, very accessible to the public, directly participative in real time, and more raucous,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opinionated and diverse than ever. All of this is full of potential to benefit our national life in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the digital age.</span>
<a name="page1443"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-3-35"><a href="#para3-35" name="para3-35">3.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, these changes have also brought new pressures into political/press relationships.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The online 24 hour presence of newspapers and other news sources has the consequence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that both press and politicians now have substantially less control over information, and face</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more competition for attention.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-36"><a href="#para3-36" name="para3-36">3.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These changes inevitably affect the dynamic of the relationship between the politicians and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press. The print press is no longer the unique medium through which public reputation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and political partisanship is contested and is no longer the all-surrounding sea in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political fish must swim or sink. But paradoxically, this may enhance the relative power of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what remains unique about the press: a powerful, mediated partisanship which may indeed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contain unspoken expectations of a tangible return.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-37"><a href="#para3-37" name="para3-37">3.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are other kinds of pressure. The Inquiry received evidence about the extent to which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians may legitimately be regarded as having relatively limited expectations of personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privacy, by virtue of their publicly accountable role, or because they have taken particular</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public positions (for example on moral issues). This is not straightforward. In law, a politician</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has like any other citizen a right to respect for his or her privacy, autonomy and family life. But</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that is a right which can be &#8216;waived&#8217; to a greater or lesser degree, or, perhaps more accurately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if less technically, &#8216;traded&#8217;. The press could be described as a &#8216;trading floor&#8217; in the extent to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which personal information is publicised, so the issue of express or implied waiver of privacy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is always potentially in issue in interactions with the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-38"><a href="#para3-38" name="para3-38">3.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Politicians may choose to concede a measure of privacy to journalists for a range of reasons;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these might be to put themselves in a good light, to offer an exclusive, or simply to maintain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a good or important working relationship. The terms of this trade are, however, hard to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">articulate, vary from person to person, and are constantly under negotiation. They are largely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">untestable too, since not bringing the issue to the test (particularly not via the law) is integral</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the maintenance of the interaction. For politicians, managing their relationships with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press is, in day to day reality, a matter of endless variation on the themes of personality,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">power and vulnerability. The civil law (of privacy and defamation) remains in position as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">long stop in cases of relationship breakdown. But there are few other rules.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-39"><a href="#para3-39" name="para3-39">3.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I was also struck by what Mr Coulson said in his evidence<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup> about the inexorable growth</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the importance of individual personality at the highest level (indeed at all levels) in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politics. Mr Coulson spoke of the significant investment needed to ensure that the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has an &#8220;authentic view&#8221; of senior politicians. That can involve a work of portraiture in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">colour and background are provided by well-chosen and sympathetic insights into aspects of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">character, and private and family life. It is easy to see that the potential dividend of bringing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the human side to the fore is an attractive one; but as some of the Inquiry&#8217;s &#8216;celebrity&#8217;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">witnesses observed, it brings with it a large and obvious risk. If an image is explicitly presented</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as &#8216;authentic&#8217;, does that not to some degree invite a challenge to the claim of authenticity,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and legitimise intrusion into other aspects of character, privacy and family life?</span>

<p id="para-id-3-40"><a href="#para3-40" name="para3-40">3.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I mention these issues because of the light they shed on how, when the press operate as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lobbyists within those personal relationships, issues of particular concern can arise.</span>

<a name="page1444"></a><!--new page--><h3>Public interest issues</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-41"><a href="#para3-41" name="para3-41">3.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The relationships within which lobbying can take place are not the everyday relationships</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of journalism and politics. They are the relationships of policy makers (actual or potential)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and those who stand to benefit directly from those policies. That is a limited category,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">comprising (on the one hand) a small number of relevant Government decision-makers and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those who credibly aspire to those positions in the future, and (on the other) the proprietors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and executive decision-makers of the press. Nevertheless this limited category of personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationships partakes fully of the personal qualities of all press/political relationships as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described above; those qualities may also include real friendship.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-42"><a href="#para3-42" name="para3-42">3.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In press/political relationships within this limited category, the boundaries between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">government, party and private business in relation to a politician&#8217;s dealings with the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are particularly fluid and blurred, and inevitably so, for all the reasons set out above. Any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual interaction is likely to contain elements of all three. Government profile and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">party political profile are virtually inseparable at the level of individual interactions, and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal dimension pervades the whole.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-43"><a href="#para3-43" name="para3-43">3.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Movement across these boundaries, although inevitable, can cause problems because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">existing formal mechanisms of public accountability applying to these relationships depend</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on them. Where press/political relationships are concerned, there appear to be few &#8216;bright</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lines&#8217; in practice between the conduct of government business with its formalities and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accountabilities on the one hand, and informal &#8216;political&#8217; or &#8216;personal&#8217; interactions on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other; the personal reputation and public profile of the politician will always be a concern at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some level in all these interactions. The theoretically separate domains are in fact inseparable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and it is this which gives rise to the problems of public perception when press lobbying takes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">place. The impression is given of decisions being taken about matters of media policy in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context of close, personal relationships (and friendships); there is then a legitimate concern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the public will be in the dark on matters of legitimate interest to them and accountability</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will be lost. The narrative of the BSkyB bid is relevant in this respect.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-44"><a href="#para3-44" name="para3-44">3.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That risk also includes the possibility that the public will not be completely in the dark, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may come to learn something of what appear to be close relationships and reasonably suspect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them of being in some degree relevant to the conduct of public affairs. Save for speculation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or intrusion, however, there is no available means of understanding how far that may be so.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That leaves the matter unsatisfactory from the public point of view; further, the speculation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exposes the politicians involved to a degree of innuendo along with the difficulty of proving</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a negative both of which could very well be unfair.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-45"><a href="#para3-45" name="para3-45">3.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The result is uncomfortable and creates a problem for all concerned: the public is entitled</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to know about a personal relationship if, but only if, it is relevant to the conduct of public</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibilities for which a politician should fairly be accountable. By their nature, the very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">senior relationships I am considering do contain the clear potential to have that sort of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevance. In the circumstances, it seems to me that it is necessary to find a way between the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bare assertion of irrelevance to the conduct of public affairs on the one hand, and intolerable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">eavesdropping on private lives, on the other. I reflect on this further below.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-46"><a href="#para3-46" name="para3-46">3.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the rough and tumble of political life, pressures within the personal relationships between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the decision-makers in the press and in politics have always been there. But there is an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argument for saying that they appear to be intensifying in ways which are associated with a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ripple of public unease. This can be described in a number of ways, but the common theme</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is the perception of the impoverishment of public debate and of risk to the public interest.</span>
<a name="page1445"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-3-47"><a href="#para3-47" name="para3-47">3.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The focus of the press and the politicians on managing the individual relationship between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">themselves at all levels has, it is said, begun to show an increased tendency to focus on what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">each stands to gain in a narrow, self-interested way, to the exclusion, and at the expense, of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the wider public, and the public interest both in journalism and in politics. As I have already</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">observed, some evidence of this is apparent in the low and declining levels of public trust</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in both press and politicians, in public disengagement from the processes of politics, in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criticism of &#8216;spin&#8217; and PR techniques, and of the infusion of celebrity values into political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behaviour and journalism.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-48"><a href="#para3-48" name="para3-48">3.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In these relationships, there is what I have described as an inevitable &#8216;trading&#8217; element. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians have exclusive news and exclusive relationships, private advocacies and personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">titbits to offer; and, in return, the press has partisanship, personal favours, the protection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of sources and not holding to account. Potential promises and threats hang in the air. It all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">means, in short, that politicians have a particular susceptibility to being lobbied when they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">get close to the opinion-makers of the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-49"><a href="#para3-49" name="para3-49">3.49</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The public, in turn, stand to be the losers. They have a reason to worry that public debate may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be being manipulated behind their backs, public policy decided unaccountably, and the ethics</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of both press and politicians compromised in the process. It was the concern of this Module</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Inquiry to reflect on the nature and proportions of that risk, and my conclusions are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">set out above.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-50"><a href="#para3-50" name="para3-50">3.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The conclusions that I have reached are troubling but this should not be surprising. In July</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2011, the Prime Minister stated that, in his view, the relationship between politicians and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press needed to be re-set, and I entirely agree. Some progress has been made since then, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I welcome the fact that the leaders of the three main national parties in this country have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not sought to challenge the proposition that my overall conclusions are justifiable on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence or to persuade me of an alternative view. But this acknowledgement is only the first</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">step on the road, not the last.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-51"><a href="#para3-51" name="para3-51">3.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Report has concluded that over not just the last thirty to thirty-five years, but really over</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">two generations, there have been failures to act politically on previous warnings about media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">misconduct. These failures can be associated with indications that, over recent decades,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press and the politicians have formed too close a relationship, and that that has in turn</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">damaged public confidence in the political process. The Terms of Reference require me</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explicitly to address this issue, and expressed in these terms, it needs to be recognised that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians have over the years been &#8216;part of the problem&#8217; of press standards.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-52"><a href="#para3-52" name="para3-52">3.52</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is clear, however, that politicians hold the complete solution. The relationship between the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">press and the politicians needs, this time, to make a distinctive break with that history, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">change in such a way that is visible to the public.</span>

<a name="section4"></a>
<h2>4. Existing regulatory framework</h2>

<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As noted above, there are very few constraints beyond the legal basics governing the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship between the press and politicians and no case can be made for the ordinary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">run of interactions between journalists and politicians to be anything other than freely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">negotiated and managed by the parties involved, without interference. The existing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;regulatory framework&#8217; is, therefore, limited to and rightly focused on only the very specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstances where there are pressing reasons of public interest to be safeguarded.</span>
<a name="page1446"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">All members of Parliament are required, for example, to comply with the Houses&#8217; rules on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">registrable declaration of interests, the purpose of which is:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;to provide information on any financial or non-financial benefit received by a MP</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or Member of the Lords which might reasonably be thought by others to influence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">their actions, speeches or votes in Parliament or influence their actions taken in their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">capacity as a Member.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This important discipline, which is obviously not confined to interests in relation to the press,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is imposed in the interests of transparency, not to inhibit the holding of interests as such but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to ensure that the public is aware of them and able to take them into account in forming a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view on politicians&#8217; conduct of Parliamentary business. Similar rules apply to the specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">articulation of interests in the course of contributing to Parliamentary debates.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The liberty of Parliamentarians to speak and act freely in Parliament is a cornerstone of our</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">constitutional democracy, protected for hundreds of years by the Bill of Rights and regularly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reaffirmed by both Parliament itself and the courts when the matter is challenged. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transparency of Members&#8217; interests is in no sense incompatible with that freedom. On the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contrary, it is designed to promote it, by ensuring that the conduct of Parliamentarians ought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not to be casually impugned by reference to allegations of hidden interests, and by allowing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Members to be mindful of any appearance of conflict between private interests and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest, and to deal with any such appearance openly and explicitly as and when it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may be relevant to the conduct of public affairs.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is a discipline whose focus is on tangible, material benefits to the politician, whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pecuniary or in kind, rather than on the subtleties of the exchanges of advantage (including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reputational advantage) which characterise press/political relationships. Although it can,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and does, for example tell the public when a politician is being paid to write articles for a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper, or when he or she holds a position on the board of a media organisation, it is not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intended to go very much further than that in telling the public about the relationship.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The principal context in which there is a regulatory dimension of any sort to the relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between the press and the politicians, therefore, is of restricted application to politicians who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are members of Government. It is obvious why that should be so. Government politicians are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in a unique relationship of power and accountability in the conduct of public business, to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">electorate. They are decision-takers. That is underpinned both in law and in practice.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-7"><a href="#para4-7" name="para4-7">4.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Asamatteroflaw,thereareanumberofdisciplines whicharecapableofimposing constraints,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">almost entirely of transparency, on the relationship between Government Ministers and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press. The Freedom of Information Act, for example, will oblige the disclosure of information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about that relationship to the public on demand, subject only to exemptions imposed to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">protect countervailing aspects of the public interests. Its application is, however, limited to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recorded information, and to information held by or on behalf of government (rather than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information held by Ministers in a party or personal capacity).</span>

<p id="para-id-4-8"><a href="#para4-8" name="para4-8">4.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government accounting rules apply disciplines and transparency measures to government</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">spending on issues relating to the press, as they do to all government spending. And the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ordinary requirements of public law in relation to decision-making in government, including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on matters such as public consultation, the giving of reasons for decisions, and the availability</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of judicial review, will also where appropriate apply to matters and interactions relating to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref32" name="footnote32" title="Go back to footnote reference 32 in the text">32</a>.  http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-interests/</p><!--footnote-->

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Other, less legally-based, disciplines will also apply but very specifically only to the conduct of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">As former Cabinet Secretary Lord O&#8217;Donnell explained to the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Code sets out, in a public document, the standards of conduct expected of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Ministers and the lines of accountability. There are high standards of conduct</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expected of Ministers and rightly so because they are decision takers and it is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">therefore important that their decisions and actions are beyond reproach. Recent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">improvements by this Government enabling greater transparency around meetings</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and hospitality are also to be welcomed. I believe this transparency about standards</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of conduct increases and helps ensure accountability.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The aspects which I believe to be relevant to the conduct of relationships between</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the media and Ministers are accountability, collective responsibility, openness and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the need to avoid any conflict of interests, including ensuring that decisions are taken</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the merits of the case and that no improper influence is brought to bear. These</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">provisions operate on a daily basis through the relationship between Ministers and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">their Permanent Secretaries. I believe the Code is stringent and provides for a high</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bar. A recent addition in July 2011 which provides for the publication of information</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about Ministers&#8217; meetings with senior media executives shows how the Code is an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">evolving document able to react to developments as they arise.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-10"><a href="#para4-10" name="para4-10">4.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his oral evidence to the Inquiry, Lord O&#8217;Donnell also explained that the Ministerial Code is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principles-based<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup> and intendedto address not just conflicts of interest but also the perception</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of conflict.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup> The amendment of July 2011, made with the support of the Prime Minister at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the same time as the Inquiry was set up, provides that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Government will be open about its links with the media. All meetings with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspaper and other media proprietors, editors and senior executives will be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">published quarterly regardless of the purpose of the meeting.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-11"><a href="#para4-11" name="para4-11">4.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord O&#8217;Donnell explained that this insertion was made to avoid any possible doubt that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requirements of paragraph 8.14 of the Ministerial Code applied to meetings with senior press</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">figures:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Ministers meet many people and organisations and consider a wide range of views</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as part of the formulation of Government policy. Departments will publish, at least</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">quarterly, details of Ministers&#8217; external meetings.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Self-evidently now, this covers a whole range of lobbying activity and is apt to cover meetings</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the limitations of the Ministerial Code. First, it obviously has no application to Opposition</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to establishing relationships and preparing for decision-taking should they be offered the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opportunity of power by the electorate. Second, it does not apply to politicians of governing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parties who do not hold government positions; again, they are not by definition decision-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">takers, although they may hope for preferment, not least by establishing useful relationships</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or otherwise acting on behalf of, or with a view to attracting the approval of, government</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ministers. Third and of critical significance, it addresses only Ministerial activities that are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">classified as government business, excluding therefore activities classifiable as either party or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private business.</span>

<h3>The gaps in the existing framework</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-13"><a href="#para4-13" name="para4-13">4.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In a nutshell, it is because of the potential overlap between the way business can be classified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as government, party or private that the relationships between the press and politicians can</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">create problems in the context of the lobbying activities of the press. The general public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest considerations underlying the transparency requirements of the Code are being only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">partially served by what is presently required.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-14"><a href="#para4-14" name="para4-14">4.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As I have said, those general public interest considerations do not necessarily lie in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suppression or discouragement of lobbying relationships. They lie in the transparency of those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationships and the enhanced accountability which follows from that transparency. Just as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the case of Parliamentary disclosure of interests, good democratic governance requires</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the interests and influences to which Ministers are subject should not necessarily be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subject to restriction as such, but should be known about and understood, so that judgments</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can be made about their decisions and the decisions will be taken in the knowledge that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those judgments will be made.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-15"><a href="#para4-15" name="para4-15">4.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Putatitscrudest,theproblemoftheincompletefitbetweenthepublic interestconsiderations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">underlying the Ministerial Code and the realities of political/press relationships, raises a form</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of what might be described as anti-avoidance issues. If it is too easy for a Minister to classify</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">an encounter with the press as &#8216;political&#8217; or &#8216;personal&#8217; business rather than &#8216;government&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">business, the formal checks and balances on propriety and accountability in decision-taking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">become too marginal to do proper service. Furthermore, that threefold classification into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">government, party and personal relationships may be more theoretical than real where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationships with the press are concerned; such relationships are characteristically more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complex and fluid than that. Again, from the same perspective, if a Minister and a press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proprietor or executive arrange to conduct aspects of their relationship via intermediaries,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then a transparency provision biting only on the Minister&#8217;s own behaviour will have little real</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">force.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-16"><a href="#para4-16" name="para4-16">4.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Put slightly differently, and allowing for the observation of the spirit as well as the letter of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Ministerial Code, the problem is one of partial transparency which potentially distorts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public perspective on the relationship. In turn, that potentially does damage to the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accountability which the Code is intended to serve. If the public is told that a politician has a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">single meeting with a press interest on &#8216;government&#8217; business, but knows nothing about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">weekly or daily interactions on &#8216;political&#8217; or &#8216;personal&#8217; business, to a potentially significant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">degree, the public is being misinformed in a matter in which it has a legitimate interest. As I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have said, the three are not so easily separable in practice.</span>
<a name="page1449"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-4-17"><a href="#para4-17" name="para4-17">4.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">And, just as important, in this situation, there is a very powerful incentive and momentum</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">precisely for the lobbyists of the press to guide their political relationships into the private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sphere of friendships, and to cultivate the private dimensions of the political friendships they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">already have. That need not be a cynical process, but may simply be intuitive. I have no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reason to doubt that the appetite for and gift of political friendships of people like Rebekah</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Brooks and Rupert Murdoch was (and was almost certainly experienced as) wholly authentic.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">But such friendships not only intensify the influence of the lobbyist, they pull the relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(including its lobbying dimension) out of the sphere of accountability. The closer, the more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intense, the relationship, the lesser the public accountability.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-18"><a href="#para4-18" name="para4-18">4.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence the Inquiry received about this hinterland of press/political interaction at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the level of personal friendships was one of the particularly cogent features of this Module</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Inquiry in the public mind. I readily recognise that this interest had its trivial and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indeed, intrusive dimension: this, in itself, is a problem. I have repeatedly emphasised that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there are and must remain limits on the legitimate public interest in knowing the details</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about politicians&#8217; private lives and genuine friendships. But the public interest in knowing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">something of the fact and degree of such friendships, where they overlap with extremely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">powerful lobbying interests, is another matter. In that, it is my view that the Inquiry performed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a legitimate public service, and it is in this area that I consider that a way forward needs to</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">be found.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-19"><a href="#para4-19" name="para4-19">4.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is important, however, to be very clear indeed about the limited nature of the problem I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">see here. I hope that I have already put beyond doubt that I emphatically do not see any case</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at all for interference in the day to day business of the interaction between journalist and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politician. Political journalism as a genre has a more powerful claim than many others to be at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the heart of those essential functions the press performs in a democracy, keeping the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">informed, holding power to account, and providing a vibrant forum for vigorous debate on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matters of public life. This is turn requires free-flowing interaction between politicians and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-20"><a href="#para4-20" name="para4-20">4.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The issue is not one about political journalism, nor indeed about journalism of any sort. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is about the relationship between the press and politicians, complex and multi-faceted as it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is, as the arena within which decisions about public policy relating to the media are lobbied</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about and, ultimately, taken.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-21"><a href="#para4-21" name="para4-21">4.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The essence of the problem disclosed by the evidence to the Inquiry is not just that politicians</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may have simply spent too much time and effort on the press, to the detriment of other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">claims on their attention to the conduct of public affairs. It is that, although it has not been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their intention, politicians have risked actual or potential conflict of interest (via both fear</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">and favour) and have done so in dealing with sources of influence which are, in themselves,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">powerful and unaccountable.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-22"><a href="#para4-22" name="para4-22">4.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The perception that politicians have done this out of public sight has diminished public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scrutiny and accountability and run the risk of eroding public trust as the full facts emerge.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In this way, a view gains ground that power and influence have been traded in ways which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are contrary to the public interest, most especially in relation to media policy issues. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principal example of that relates to the long history of missed opportunities to address public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns about press standards.</span>

<h2>5.  Recommendations for future relations between  politicians and the press</h2>

<h3>The starting point</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I should perhaps begin this section by being as clear as possible, again, about the matters I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have no intention of affecting by means of my recommendations in this Part of the Report.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, nothing I suggest is intended to intrude into or impact on the private lives and private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationships of either of politicians or press figures. Second, I have no intention of affecting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political journalism as I have already defined it.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is a problem about public policy making, about the political approach to media policy and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press standards in particular and concerns the relationship between politicians and the policy-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">makers and decision-takers of the media, that is to say with proprietors, senior executives</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and editors. This is the only area which, to my mind, can cause real concern, not least because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the power of their ability to lobby and use that ability (along with an extremely effective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">megaphone) to serve their own interests.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-3"><a href="#para5-3" name="para5-3">5.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In taking a different approach to these relationships I entirely endorse the analysis of Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">O&#8217;Donnell in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref39" href="#footnote39">39</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8220;[T]here will be conversations and meetings with individual journalists which are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the basic lifeblood of politicians and the media interacting. If you see in the House of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Commons, there are many media representatives there and Ministers, they interact,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they talk, they phone each other. So &#8230; I&#8217;m putting the bar at the editors and news</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proprietors above.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">&#8230;.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve taken the view that we should define the line at fairly senior proprietors and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">senior editors. I think they are different because of the ability of newspapers to very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">strongly support particular political parties. So I think there is something to be said</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for those things being noted in a transparent way, but they shouldn&#8217;t be stopped.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-4"><a href="#para5-4" name="para5-4">5.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The core of the problem is the accountability of politicians, not the conduct of the press.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is not simply a matter of significance in its own right. It plays into the wider concern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the role and responsibilities of politicians in (or aspiring to) decision-making positions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in Government and the problems of public perception which these have generated.</span>

<h3>Transparency</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-5"><a href="#para5-5" name="para5-5">5.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">To the extent that the Inquiry has gone any way towards affecting the approach to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship between senior politicians and the press, it has done so by shining an intense but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">temporary light on the issue. Transparency, in this sense, provides both an opportunity for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public to understand and assess along with a discipline which is likely to touch on the conduct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of those involved. However, longer term, there is not enough in the current transparency</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provisions although these are themselves designed to underpin public confidence. There</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">needs to be a workable and proportionate middle way for the future.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref39" name="footnote39" title="Go back to footnote reference 39 in the text">39</a>.  p37, lines 14-24 and pp 39-40, lines 20-1, Lord O&#8217;Donnell, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-14-May-2012.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1451"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-5-6"><a href="#para5-6" name="para5-6">5.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the circumstances, I have concluded that it is appropriate to offer some detailed thoughts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on possible improvements. The fact is that the relationship between politicians and the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has incentives on both sides which could serve to encourage a lack of openness so that a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">simple and generalised appeal to transparency is unlikely either to be self-fulfilling or, more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">widely, to command public confidence.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-7"><a href="#para5-7" name="para5-7">5.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That is particularly so in the area of media policy which is the principal subject-matter of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this Report, namely press standards themselves. This is an area in which press lobbying can</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be particularly powerful by virtue of being concerted. It is illuminating to note the limited</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extent to which the press hold power to account when that power resides in the influence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wielded by the organisations of the press themselves, even in the case of competitors (to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which generalisation, there are obvious, honourable, exceptions). It is an area in which I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no doubt that the press have acted and will continue to act as powerful lobbyists and yet one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in which (by admission) the politicians have repeatedly failed to respond to public concerns</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as one series of problems follows another: this is notwithstanding the bewildering number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of inquiries that have been conducted. It should not be surprising, therefore, that I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concluded that further steps do need to be taken to address public concerns together with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the realities of, and perceptions surrounding, the relationships which have given rise to them.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-8"><a href="#para5-8" name="para5-8">5.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Before discussing how it might be possible to increase the visibility of the way in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians and the press interact at the highest levels of policy formulation, it is necessary to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognise that transparency, on its own, has its limits. There are three which I bear particularly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in mind in making the recommendations I do.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) There are very proper limits on the extent to which public intrusion into matters</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">genuinely private is tolerable or appropriate. The detail of truly private friendships and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationships between politicians (however much they may have invited or permitted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intrusion into their privacy) and individuals within the press merits respect.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) There is a danger of the perverse incentive, well recognised in the context of regimes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suchasthatestablished bytheFreedomofInformation Act.This dangeristhatmeasures</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to increase transparency simply drive activity into a different place. The result is that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">incentives are to be found for avoidance measures (such as ignoring the need to keep</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some record or finding alternative ways to communicate) which serve only to put</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accountability ever more distantly out of reach.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) Thereisalsoariskofadifferenteffect.Excessivelyburdensomerulesabouttransparency</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are impractical; mistakes and omissions then become virtually inevitable and, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">themselves, produce unwarranted critique and suspicion. Ultimately, this is all counter-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">productive and erodes trust.</span>

<h3>Towards more transparent relationships</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-9"><a href="#para5-9" name="para5-9">5.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I believe that further steps in the direction of transparency are necessary in order to reassure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public and restore confidence in the way the politicians handle those relationships with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the media in which lobbying is a real possibility. Without seeking to be prescriptive as to what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be said, therefore:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">I recommend as a first step that political leaders reflect constructively on the merits </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">of  publishing  on  behalf  of  their  party  a  statement  setting  out,  for  the  public,  an </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">explanation  of  the  approach  they  propose  to  take  as  a  matter  of  party  policy  in </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">conducting relationships with the press. </span>
<a name="page1452"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-5-10"><a href="#para5-10" name="para5-10">5.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first value of such a public exposition is that it would be a recognition of the potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pitfalls of the relationship, a statement of intention to promote a more transparent approach,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and an explanation of how the public could expect to benefit as a result. That itself would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">help to address issues of public confidence. Clearly setting out the rules they proposed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apply to themselves, and by which they expected to be judged, would be both open and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">demonstrably accountable: no doubt political journalism could be expected to play its part in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assessing the approach and, thus, holding political power to account.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-11"><a href="#para5-11" name="para5-11">5.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In recommending to political leaders how they might best go about that task, I cannot improve</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the evident animating spirit and exhortation of renewal contained in the Foreword of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Prime Minister to the most recent edition of the Ministerial Code,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup> published when the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">current Coalition Government took office following the 2010 General Election:</span>

<p id="para-id-5-12"><a href="#para5-12" name="para5-12">5.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Remaining with the spirit of the Ministerial Code as a starting point, it is worth considering</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the possibility that there should be greater Ministerial transparency beyond its current scope.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Code itself prescribes the approach that should be adopted by Ministers to many if not all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aspects of their ministerial duties relying on the clarity of the boundary between what may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be described as political or private activities on the one hand and the conduct of government</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">business on the other. However, there is a real risk that the two become blurred in the context</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of influential media relationships and that the latter will be transacted within the space left</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the former; that risk should not be overlooked.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-13"><a href="#para5-13" name="para5-13">5.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The amendment last year to the Ministerial Code recognised the nature of the problem but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it remains. The Inquiry has revealed that the way in which some of these relationships have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">just been too complex for the Ministerial Code to render what is happening fairly transparent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the public in even the most basic way: whether or not lobbying of Ministers on matters</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of public policy takes place in what is &#8216;party&#8217; or &#8216;private&#8217; time, there is likely to be a public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perception that it is.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-14"><a href="#para5-14" name="para5-14">5.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is not satisfactory especially where the public interest in a free and responsible press is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerned and I have little doubt that what has been revealed in the course of the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has changed public perceptions and expectations in this respect: the challenge is now to</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref40" name="footnote40" title="Go back to footnote reference 40 in the text">40</a>.  http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/ministerial-code-may-2010.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1453"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">meet those expectations in a way that both respects where the boundaries should lie and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is workable.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-15"><a href="#para5-15" name="para5-15">5.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the light of the limitations to the Ministerial Code, I conclude that senior politicians</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should now give very serious consideration to accepting the case for public transparency</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at least to some degree beyond interactions which may be narrowly categorised as entirely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on &#8216;government&#8217; business in order to give a more rounded picture. That does require the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contemplation of transparency measures in relation to conduct in what might be capable of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being described as the political or private activities of politicians, but which, for reasons I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described above, I consider to be in practice inseparable from their conduct of public business.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-16"><a href="#para5-16" name="para5-16">5.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As I explain below, I haveonly verylimited steps in mind. I am also aware that the concerns that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have expressed about, for example, the use of &#8216;private&#8217; means of communication (personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">phones, texts and so on) for transacting government business may require a broader look</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the issues than is open to me and, furthermore, that there could be wider implications</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to that which I suggest. I venture into this area because I believe that the concerns about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the relationship between politicians and the press which have been ventilated in the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">do justify a proportionate and appropriate response. In the circumstances, in encouraging</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians of all parties to consider the problem, I set out steps that could be taken in this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">direction simply as a starting point to their deliberations. Having said that, I remain of the view</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there are problems in this area which are of special relevance to the relations between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians and the press. I believe that these aspects can fairly be dealt with without being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made to wait for any broader review.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-17"><a href="#para5-17" name="para5-17">5.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, I have come to the very clear conclusion that transparency must be improved not just</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to interactions taking place directly between senior politicians and proprietors,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper editors and senior executives, but also where they take place between their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">respective agents, such as junior political colleagues, SpAds and civil servants on the political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">side, and representatives and professional lobbyists on the press side. As I have said, while</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the focus must be firmly on the policy-makers and decision-takers, and while it is important</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to leave plenty of unrestricted space for the ordinary transactions of political journalism,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public would be entitled to be sceptical if measures designed to increase transparency</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were circumvented by the use of third-party agents or &#8216;back channels&#8217;. Needless to say, these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">measures should apply to such third party agents only where they are acting in that capacity,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that is to say on behalf of their principals in matters of policy.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-18"><a href="#para5-18" name="para5-18">5.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, I also conclude that it would be in the public interest for obligations of greater</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transparencytobeundertakennotonlybyMinistersin GovernmentbutalsobytheLeaderand</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Front Bench of the Official Opposition (and, as in the recent past, the Leader and Front Bench</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a major third party). In this I am conscious of stepping into an area of public life, outside</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the propriety and transparency constraints of the conduct of elections and of Parliamentary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Government business, in which public accountability is an underdeveloped concept, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it seems right to do so.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-19"><a href="#para5-19" name="para5-19">5.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I say that in the first place because in answer to a general question on the comparison between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government and Opposition, the current Leader of the Opposition has accepted that, broadly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">speaking, similar standards should apply.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup> Not the least reason for this entirely appropriate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stance is that the lobbying activities of the press in relation to politicians should not, in my</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view, be undertaken on anything other than a level playing field in terms of party politics.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref41" name="footnote41" title="Go back to footnote reference 41 in the text">41</a>.  p11, lines 1-4, Ed Miliband, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-12-June-2012.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1454"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-5-20"><a href="#para5-20" name="para5-20">5.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In any event, there is another, substantive reason. This relates to the public interest in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understanding not only the press influences on the exercise of executive power, but also the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">influences on the aspirants to executive power. The lobbying relationship between the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the politicians is not short term with the impact of general elections being only one part</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the continuum. The Report has noted the issues that arise for the conduct of the political/</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press relationship in the transition from Opposition to Government status, particularly after</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lengthy periods of Opposition and, as Alastair Campbell recognised, there is a risk that habits</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">formed in Opposition will remain entrenched in Government in a way that is not, ultimately,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conducive to the public interest.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-21"><a href="#para5-21" name="para5-21">5.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In these circumstances I have further concluded that public interest considerations of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transparency apply also in respect of opposition parties who may aspire to, or find themselves</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inapositionof, holdingabalanceofexecutive powerifnotexercisingitoutright.Thisconclusion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only serves to underline the critical requirement of a cross party approach to these issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">while they are at the forefront of public attention. Lord O&#8217;Donnell put it this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think there&#8217;s an opportunity, a window of opportunity to get the opposition parties</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">togetherand say to them:can therebe a set of guidelines,code of conduct, something,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which would cover these relationships which all could sign up to?&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">My recommendation is that this opportunity be taken. My starting point, as I have explained,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be parity of application for both Government and Opposition, but if there are genuine</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">points of distinction no doubt they could be explored and explained to the public.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-22"><a href="#para5-22" name="para5-22">5.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That is not to say that I do not understand the significance of suggesting measures to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">followed both by Government Ministers and members of the Opposition Front Benches.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Their positions bear comparison from the point of view of the public interest in transparency,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but not of course in terms of the regulatory context. The Ministerial Code has no application</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">outside government. However, I do not recommend any change that will (or should) have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the force of law and the Government itself will have to reflect on whether acceptance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">my recommendations would have implications for the Ministerial Code or would be better</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dealt with otherwise. I fully recognise that in both cases, although I give an indication of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where I consider improvements could be made, implementing any such steps would have to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">constitute something of a self denying ordinance.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-23"><a href="#para5-23" name="para5-23">5.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having said that, I have no doubt that the public needs and expects increased transparency</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from all political leaders. Without a limited (but significant) improvement in the visibility of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contact at the highest levels between proprietors, newspaper editors and senior executives</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the one hand and those who develop media policy on the other, the public is entitled to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be sceptical that it is being left out of account in exchanges of influence. I am concerned that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lack of trust and confidence will inevitably ensue.</span>

<h3>What might be done?</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-24"><a href="#para5-24" name="para5-24">5.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The amended Ministerial Code now requires of Ministers a quarterly publication of all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meetings between Ministers and senior media figures, regardless of the purpose of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meeting. I suggest therefore that consideration be given to the adoption of the same principle</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of transparency, in the first place for:</span>

<a name="page1455"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) Opposition Front Bench spokesmen;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) meetings involving not just the politicians and media principals themselves but also the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">agents of each as described above; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) so far as practicable (about which I say a little more below) meetings between these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principals or agents in whatever capacity in which the meeting could be said to take</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">place.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-25"><a href="#para5-25" name="para5-25">5.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I recommend that consideration be given also to the publication not merely of the fact of such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meetings in themselves, but also the fact of any discussion taking place at such meetings of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media policy issues, by which phrase I mean the formulation and implementation of general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public policy in relation to the media, including in relation to media standards, as well as any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significant policy issues or decisions relating to individual media organisations.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-26"><a href="#para5-26" name="para5-26">5.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">What information might be published about the content of any such discussion should of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">course be guided by the particular public interest in the transparency of such discussion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in itself. It must, of course, in doing so have regard to other public interest issues such as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commercial confidentiality and reasonable personal privacy but, overall, could depend on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the balance of the public interest on a case by case basis. Even an explanation of the reasons</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for withholding information would aid public understanding. Enhancing public confidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">depends on the spirit of any such measures and a genuine willingness to address the issue of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">how matters look to the public, rather than a legalistic or bureaucratic focus on the specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">formulation of any provision. I am not recommending that transparency measures should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessarily extend further into content beyond a very general identification of topics covered.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-27"><a href="#para5-27" name="para5-27">5.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, it is clear that the problem does not simply (or even mainly) arise within face</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to face meetings and, in my view, there is more than a legitimate case for contemplating</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some limited transparency obligation in relation to other communications (such as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">correspondence, phone, text and e-mail). Again, there should be no suggestion of exhaustive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">new requirements for record keeping or the collection of statistics; that would be both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impractical and unnecessary, not to say counter-productive. However I do not consider that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it need be either intrusive or burdensome for politicians to indicate on a quarterly basis, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to any individual senior principal within the press (or their agents), by way of general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">estimate, something about the frequency or density of such interactions, for example by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reference to some common-sense and very general published parameters. I do not suggest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there is any case for descending into detail or content.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-28"><a href="#para5-28" name="para5-28">5.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">My purpose in identifying these possibilities is simply to suggest that consideration be given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to a moderate, achievable move in the direction of further transparency and improvement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of public confidence. I re-emphasise that the class of persons within the media to whom it</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">is intended to apply is very limited; the point is that it is a category which produces unique</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contexts for press lobbying and, in consequence, unique public interest concerns.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-29"><a href="#para5-29" name="para5-29">5.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Common sense has an overarching part to play. There are, for instance, a number of cases in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which meetings and other communications may take place extremely frequently, for example</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the case of close lifelong friends or partners. In cases of genuine impracticability of this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sort, it would undoubtedly be sufficient simply to note the fact of that relationship. Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s approach to such cases was this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup></span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref44" name="footnote44" title="Go back to footnote reference 44 in the text">44</a>.  p38, lines 11-24 and p39, lines 5-12, Lord O&#8217;Donnell, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-14-May-2012.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1456"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Where you have a lifelong friend who happens to work in industry X, what you should</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">do is disclose that to your permanent secretary and you say you meet this person</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">socially all the time. If it were to happen that a policy issue arose where industry X</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was absolutely crucial and it would have a big impact on that, then stronger degrees</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of transparency might be required and you might need to remind the minister that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">actually this person that they socialise with all the time, they have to be particularly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">careful or they might want to amend their behaviour in some way during a particular</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">period when that was a big issue.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">&#8230;.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;All politicians come into politics having developed a social circle already. They have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">friends. It&#8217;s a rather good thing, in my view, that politicians have got quite normal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relationships and they have friends from different backgrounds, different - maybe</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in industry, they may be trade unionists, they may be teachers, nurses. That&#8217;s a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">good thing.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-30"><a href="#para5-30" name="para5-30">5.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As I said at the time that Lord O&#8217;Donnell gave this evidence, I entirely agree and absolutely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nothing in this Report should be taken as suggesting that this should change. It is difficult</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enough to encourage able people to enter public life and not only must a measure of trust</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be extended to all who do but, additionally, steps must be taken to ensure that they, also, are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provided with a sufficient amount of private space. I have not, however, found myself able</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to conclude that internal disclosure mechanisms (such as Lord O&#8217;Donnell mentions when he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">refers to private disclosure to a senior official) will be sufficient as a means of restoring public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">trust and confidence. The problem is not a narrow one of conflict or propriety; it is a problem</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of public perception and legitimate concern about the extent to which existing accountability</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mechanisms do not provide a sufficient answer. The relationship between the press and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians, in this albeit limited respect has become something which the public needs to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">able to see and understand.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-31"><a href="#para5-31" name="para5-31">5.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In conclusion, I have no doubt, that the risks which I am recommending that senior politicians</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">address are clear for all to see. If their interactions with senior press and media executives</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are approached fairly and squarely with those risks consciously understood, and with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commensurate respect for public perceptions and the public interest in transparency, this is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as much as can be achieved.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">In the circumstances, I recommend that Leaders, Ministers and Front Bench Opposition </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">spokesmen consider publishing:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(a)  the simple fact of long term relationships with media proprietors, newspaper </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">editors or senior executives which might be thought to be relevant to their </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">responsibilities; and</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(b)  on a quarterly basis:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(i)  details  of  all  meetings  with  media  proprietors,  newspaper  editors  or </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">senior executives, whether in person or through agents on either side, </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">and the fact and general nature of any discussion of media policy issues at </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">those meetings; and</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(ii)  a fair and reasonably complete picture by way of general estimate only, of </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">the frequency or density of other interaction (including correspondence, </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">phone, text and email) but not necessarily including content. </span>
<a name="page1457"></a><!--new page--><h3>Implementation</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-32"><a href="#para5-32" name="para5-32">5.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is already room for enormous value to be obtained from acceptance in principle of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the need for greater transparency. This Inquiry was commissioned with cross-party political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consensus specifically to respond to public concern; it follows the concession both from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition that the relationship between the press and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians had become too close. I have set out in this Part of the Report the ways in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it seems to me that that closeness has been contrary to the public interest, and insufficiently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transparent. At the same time, the Inquiry has been conducted against the agreed background</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, in common with earlier mechanisms for self regulation of the press, the PCC has failed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to meet the legitimate requirements of the public and must be replaced. Something needs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be done.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-33"><a href="#para5-33" name="para5-33">5.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">How that is to be achieved in practice? Inquiries come and go, but the constant traffic between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politics and the media is as old as democracy itself. Although the Inquiry has sought to provide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a very open forum in which both the press and the politicians could explain their positions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to me, and thereby to the public, this has inevitably taken place against a background of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">continuing conversation between press and politicians to which the Inquiry and the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has not fully been party. Some of that conversation has played out in the editorial and opinion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pages of the press, and more rarely in the public observations of politicians; much more of it,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no doubt, more privately.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-34"><a href="#para5-34" name="para5-34">5.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">With some limited exceptions but as the press are fully entitled to do, even before I concluded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thisReport,theystartedusingtheirconsiderablemegaphonesfortheirownpurposes.Itwould</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be surprising if they had not done the same with their senior access to those responsible for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">making decisions in this area, that is to say, the Government and other leading politicians.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This has not, however, happened under the sort of conditions of transparency which I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concluded to be an essential component for the restoration of public trust and confidence.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-35"><a href="#para5-35" name="para5-35">5.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry takes its place historically at the end of decades in which the lobbying activities</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press on the matter of press standards have not been conducted under the sorts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of considerations of transparency which I am now recommending for consideration. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusions of this Report are to the effect that successive governments have failed to meet</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasonable public expectations in their approach to this issue, evidently to at least some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">degree under the influence of fear of favour of the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-36"><a href="#para5-36" name="para5-36">5.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am hopeful that genuine, informed, and vigorous public debate about the future of press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards will follow the publication of this Report. That can include an evaluation of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence which I have set out in detail, the merits of the various policy options and the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">different perspectives which can be brought to the issue from the many who are affected by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it, as indeed we all are. It is critical, however, that the public must have full confidence in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political process engaged in that response; if it does not, the solution will hardly attract the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public confidence that is essential for it to succeed,</span>

<p id="para-id-5-37"><a href="#para5-37" name="para5-37">5.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In my view, the public has an entirely legitimate interest in understanding how the decisions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made about the Report will be taken in the public interest. Obviously, the views of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will be very important but if lobbying is to play a part (particularly if conveyed in private),</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there is a public interest in transparency about that fact and how extensive it has been.</span>
<a name="page1458"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">In  the  circumstances,  I  recommend  that  the  suggestions  that  I  have  made  in  the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">direction of greater transparency about meetings and contacts should be considered </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">not  just  as  a  future  project  but  as  an  immediate  need,  not  least  in  relation  to </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">interactions relevant to any consideration of this Report. I encourage politicians to </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">reflect on the legitimate public interest in understanding at least something about the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">interactions they have had with the press (whether direct or indirect) on the subject </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">matter of the Inquiry. It is clear from all that has been put into the public domain that </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">the press and the politicians have been closely engaged on this and doubtless with </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">continue to be. The opportunity for transparency is obvious.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-38"><a href="#para5-38" name="para5-38">5.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The onus on leading politicians of the country to seek to reach a consensus conclusion, taking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">account of all the interests affected, will have a significant impact on public confidence for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">another reason. As the Rt Hon Sir John Major graphically put it:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I have no idea what this Inquiry will recommend, but if it makes recommendations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that require action, then I think it is infinitely more likely that that action will be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">carried into legislation if it has the support of the major parties. If it does not, if one</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">party breaks off and decides it&#8217;s going to seek future favour with powerful proprietors</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and press barons by opposing it, then it will be very difficult for it to be carried into</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">law, and I think that is something that is very important. So I think there is an especial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">responsibility on the leaders of the three major parties. 20-odd years ago &#8211; 23 years</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ago, I think &#8211; a senior minister said the press were drinking in the last-chance saloon.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think on this occasion it&#8217;s the politicians who are in the last-chance saloon. If, at the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">end of this Inquiry, with the recommendations that may be made &#8211; and I don&#8217;t seek</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to forecast what they may be, but if the recommendations that are made are not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enacted and nothing is done, it is difficult to see how this matter could be returned to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in any reasonable period of time, and those parts of the press which have behaved</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">badly will continue to behave badly and put at a disadvantage those parts of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press that do not behave badly.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I reiterate: I think the underlying purpose is to eliminate the bad behaviour and bring</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the bad up to the level of the good, and the bad is just a cancer in the journalistic</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">body. It isn&#8217;t the journalistic body as a whole. And I think in the interests of the best</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">form of journalism, it is important that whatever is recommended is taken seriously</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by Parliament, and it is infinitely more likely to be enacted if neither of the major</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">parties decides to play partisan short-term party politics with it by seeking to court</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the favour of an important media baron who may not like what is proposed.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-39"><a href="#para5-39" name="para5-39">5.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The perception of the public may well consider that the phrase &#8220;courting favour&#8221; accurately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">represents what happens if private lobbying and influence leaves insufficient space for open,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">measured and balanced debate that is based on facts and reasoned argument.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-40"><a href="#para5-40" name="para5-40">5.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The conclusion of this Report is that successive Governments have failed to meet reasonable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public expectations in their approach to the issue of press standards. These must ensure,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the one hand, that the press is free to hold power to account, to conduct investigative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalism in the public interest, to provide commentary however partisan or irreverent, to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fulfil the needs of the public. On the other hand, the press has to be accountable to the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in whose interests it claims to be acting and must show respect for the rights of others to such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extent as legitimate public interest does not justify otherwise. It should not be acceptable</span>
