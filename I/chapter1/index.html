<h1>CHAPTER 1<br/>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition to addressing other concerns, the Terms of Reference require the Inquiry to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examine the relationship between national newspapers and politicians and the conduct of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">each. That this issue should have been considered relevant to an Inquiry into the culture,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and ethics of the press is a matter of considerable significance. It implies the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">existence of legitimate questions of public concern about the nature of that relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and conduct, and about the connection between that relationship and the current state of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press standards and accountabilities. It asks, in other words, whether anything about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship between the press and the politicians has amounted to &#8216;part of the problem&#8217; of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press standards.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In doing so, and in putting these questions before a judge-led inquiry, the Terms of Reference</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">required reflection on the relationship between press and politicians in a way which was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant to and directed towards the issue of press culture, practices and ethics, and of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">course to do so in an objective, evidenced, analytical and politically neutral way. That too</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is significant. If there have been failures of public interest in the relationship between press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and politicians, then our democracy provides ways in which politicians can account for that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">directly to the public. However, if there were failures of what might be called generic political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">culture (a pattern across time and across parties) and if there were failures in the democratic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mechanisms for accountability, then the ordinary political means of challenging and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigating such matters might not have been effective. The politicians would themselves</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been, or at least appeared, too close to the problem itself to address it in a way which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would leave no doubts in the mind of the public.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An issue of closeness is at the heart of this part of the Terms of Reference. More specifically,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the issue is whether that relationship between politicians and the press had become too</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">close in respects which might not have best served the public interest. The Prime Minister</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">himself said that he believed that to be the case, first in July 2011 and subsequently when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interviewed by Andrew Marr on 29 April 2012 when he said this:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Have we all got too close? Yes. Do we spend too much time on this short-term news</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">management agenda? Yes, we do. Should we try and have a better relationship where</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we fight the daily fire fight with the media, but we focus on the long-term change our</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">economy needs, our society needs? Yes. And if that comes out of Leveson, great.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">To put the matter in context from the outset, however, it is essential first to reflect the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">overwhelming evidence that relations between politicians and the press on a day to day</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">basis are in robust good health and performing the vital public interest functions of a free</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press in a vigorous democracy, providing an open forum for public debate, enabling a free</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">flow of information and challenge and holding power to account. If there were any doubts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about that they would have been dispelled by the perceptive insights of both politicians and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political journalists and commentators among the Inquiry&#8217;s witnesses, and by the remarkable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">quantity and quality of contemporary coverage of this module of the Inquiry&#8217;s work.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Political journalism is one of the most highly-prized aspects of a free press operating in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">developeddemocracy.Ithasoftenbeenreferredtoasthe&#8216;lifebloodofdemocracy&#8217;,invigorating</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the body politic and supporting the effectiveness of democratic accountabilities. It is in this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">area (although not just in this area) that the press performs some of the most essential public</span>
<a name="page1117"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">interest functions on which we all depend. Some excellent examples were seen first-hand</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">during the course of the Inquiry&#8217;s deliberations. I make very clear at the outset therefore that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political journalism is not the focus of this Part of the Report, and indeed the Inquiry has had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clearly in mind throughout the importance of ensuring that political journalism is fostered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and encouraged to the greatest degree possible for the future.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This Part of the Report is not therefore directed at the relationships of everyday political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalism other than by way of background, nor particularly to the issue of press standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as they might apply to such journalism. Nor did the Inquiry pursue as a separate issue the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">status of individual politicians as actual or potential victims of media misconduct (although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the course of evidence there have been a number of accounts of the impact of personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attacks upon politicians by the press and concern about the potential for such attacks).</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The narrative of this Part of the Report explores instead a very different aspect of the closeness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the relationship between press and politicians, the one that is in my view most directly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant to the public interest concerns that prompted the setting up of this Inquiry in the first</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">place. That is the question of a closeness which may have, or appear to have, impacted on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">willingness or ability of the politicians to decide matters of public policy about the media, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specifically of policy on press standards, fairly and impartially in the public interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As I have already said,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> this Inquiry takes its place in responding to the latest in a long sequence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of spikes in public concern about press standards; this time it is phone hacking. That history</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is also a history of what has been described as failures by the politicians to make appropriate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responses to those spikes in public concern. The Inquiry has taken a brief but informative look</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at what has happened in the past, with the invaluable privilege of access to the perspectives</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of many of those directly involved. In doing so, it has considered whether there was any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discernible pattern in that history, and if so whether it was a pattern which could be related</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to a relationship that was &#8216;too close&#8217;. The historical approach, which is reflected in this Part</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Report, is not therefore academic (and certainly does not pretend to any degree of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">historical discipline or originality); but is, as should be expected of an Inquiry of this nature,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thematic and inquisitorial.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Module Three of the Inquiry has focused on the more recent manifestations of this issue, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is an issue which I recognise (as has been pointed out) goes back in time very much further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than that. The fact that I have not heard oral evidence about relations between the national</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press and politicians at a period any earlier than the middle of the last century certainly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does not mean that I am blind to the very considerable influence which the press barons</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are generally agreed to have had on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians. I am well aware from written evidence and other material in the public domain of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the role in public life which Lords Northcliffe, Beaverbrook and Rothermere had in their day.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The power wielded in the past by these proprietors, and their influential relationships with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the politicians of their time, demonstrates that the issues which the Inquiry is now addressing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are far from new. However, these earlier events are not sufficiently proximate to the current</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">culture to merit detailed examination: the primary focus of the Inquiry has been on what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should happen in the future in the light of what has happened more recently.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-10"><a href="#para1-10" name="para1-10">1.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chronologically, the Inquiry began its focus on the relationship with evidence about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acquisition in 1981byRupert Murdoch of The Times and The Sunday Times and it has reflected</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on events from then to the present. To have gone back further would have demanded too</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">much of any witness and was highly unlikely to have added to the understanding which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">emerged from the oral evidence which itself spanned a period of 31 years. That oral evidence</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref1" name="footnote1" title="Go back to footnote reference 1 in the text">1</a>.  Part D Chapter 1</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1118"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">is, of course, supplemented by documentary evidence some of which goes back considerably</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">before 1981.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-11"><a href="#para1-11" name="para1-11">1.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">From this, a clear pattern has in my view emerged about the relationship between the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the politicians in recent years at the most senior levels of influence. There is of course no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence at all of explicit, covert deals between senior politicians and newspaper proprietors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or editors; no-one should seriously have expected that there would be. These very powerful</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationships are more subtle than that, the extent to which interests coincide or diverge is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more complicated, and the dialogue more sophisticated. But there can be no doubt that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within these relationships, some of them having the quality of personal friendships (and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some of active hostility), there have been exchanges of influence on matters of public policy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which have given rise to legitimate questions about the trust and confidence the public can</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have that they have been conducted scrupulously in the public interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-12"><a href="#para1-12" name="para1-12">1.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Care has to be taken in talking about &#8216;influence&#8217;. It is the prerogative of a free and partisan</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press in a democracy to campaign, lobby and seek to influence both public opinion and public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">policy. Where the issues arise is in the nature, visibility and accountability of the politicians&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">response. Nor is the existence of personal relationships and friendships at senior levels</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between press and politicians anything other than entirely natural and to be expected. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues arise here in relation to the conduct of public affairs in the context of such relationships,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and in the boundaries between public and private, accountable and unaccountable.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-13"><a href="#para1-13" name="para1-13">1.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The pattern which emerges is one in which senior press/political relationships have been too</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">close to give sufficient grounds for confidence that fear or favour have not been operative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">factors in the determination and implementation of media policy. That has been the position</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for some years at least. It is not a state of affairs confined to any one political party.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-14"><a href="#para1-14" name="para1-14">1.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This section examines in particular the decision to permit Mr Murdoch&#8217;s News Corporation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to acquire The Times and The Sunday Times; the terms of the Broadcasting Act 1990 (insofar</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as they concerned foreign and cross media ownership) which were such as to permit Sky TV</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to continue in the ownership of News Corporation; the passage of the Communications Act</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2003, in particular the development of its provisions on foreign and cross media ownership,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which in their final form would not have prevented News Corporation from acquiring Channel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">5; and finally, the bid by News Corporation for the remaining shares in BSkyB which came to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an end shortly before the Inquiry was set up (and for connected reasons). Evidence on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">last of these matters brought into sharp focus the pressures, from more than one direction,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on governing politicians charged with making a decision of great importance to the media.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In particular, it exposed a formidable and relentless lobbying operation which gave rise to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">serious legal and ethical issues.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-15"><a href="#para1-15" name="para1-15">1.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Onmorethanoneoccasionduringtheperiodunderconsideration,concernsabouttheculture,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and ethics of the press surfaced in public debate. However, on each occasion the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political reaction was not such as to bring about a lasting solution to the problem. As outlined</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">earlier in this Report, concern during the late 1980s reached such a level that the then Home</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Secretary commissioned Sir David Calcutt QC to lead a committee which inquired into and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reported on press standards, highlighting significant areas of legitimate public concern. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political response to the first Calcutt Report purported to give the press a final chance to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">put its own house in order before addressing the matter further. The press failed by some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">margin to meet the challenge, but the establishment of the &#8216;self-regulatory&#8217; PCC was the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">chief exception to a prevalent &#8220;do nothing&#8221; response from the Government. How and why</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that was so is examined.</span>
<a name="page1119"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-1-16"><a href="#para1-16" name="para1-16">1.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC was (or at least could have been) a step forward from its predecessor, the Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council. However, it was never endowed by the industry with the full range of powers and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resources advocated by the politicians by whom it was presented as a credible response to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public concern. In practice, as is discussed more fully elsewhere in this Report<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> irrespective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of how it described itself or the powers (however limited) that it actually had, it functioned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principally as a handler of complaints and latterly an advisory body. When concerns about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press behaviour, and of paparazzi photographers in particular, resurfaced in 1997 with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">tragic death of Diana, Princess of Wales, there was some tightening of the Editors&#8217; Code but,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as the then Prime Minister candidly accepted, he took a conscious decision to manage rather</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than to confront the media, taking the view that to have confronted the press would have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been an all consuming task.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-17"><a href="#para1-17" name="para1-17">1.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was a further missed opportunity to address press misconduct when the Information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner published his findings about the ways in which private investigators had,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in his view, unlawfully obtained confidential data which was then provided to the press in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstances (including the extent of payments made for the data) which provided ample</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">grounds for profound public concern.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> The Information Commissioner recommended</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">amendments to the Data Protection Act 1998. In the result, the political response was a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further compromise and no effective action. How that came about is also illuminating.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-18"><a href="#para1-18" name="para1-18">1.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This Part of the Report therefore begins by considering some relevant aspects of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationships between our last five Prime Ministers (including the present holder of that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">office) and the press. Political leaders have their own approaches to and experiences of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press at a personal level. Personality and individual approach greatly influence the dynamic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between a Prime Minister and the opinion-makers of the press. This Part reflects on these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationships for the insights they offer into what they might nevertheless have in common,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and into whether any patterns can be said to emerge.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-19"><a href="#para1-19" name="para1-19">1.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This search for patterns is an exercise which was fundamental to the work of the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in this Module. It would, however, be a mistake to think that the Inquiry can or should try</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to solve all of the unresolved questions about the relationship between the press and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians at the highest levels over the past 35 years. What follows, therefore, attempts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">simply and briefly to set out some of the narrative history which seemed to be particularly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant to the Terms of Reference; there is no ambition to be comprehensive or to sit in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">judgment on political history whether past or contemporary, but only to identify the extent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the issues relevant to the Inquiry and to reflect on any pointers for the future. If the most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recent past is considered in the greatest detail, that is, first, because some of these issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were prominent features of the context in which the Inquiry was set up and, second, because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contemporary concerns are inevitably uppermost in the public mind, and have had the least</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">benefit of the longer perspective.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-20"><a href="#para1-20" name="para1-20">1.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This Part then canvasses some wider contemporary political perspectives. My overall</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusions and recommendations follow.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-21"><a href="#para1-21" name="para1-21">1.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Report addresses one final matter in this Part. The public concern which led to this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry stands at the end of a long line of surges in public concern. Each has been followed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by a political response which has not adequately addressed that concern. This all has to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">viewed in the context of press/political relationships which themselves appear to have had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">problematic dimensions. Thus, the approach to this Inquiry also deserves consideration.</span>
