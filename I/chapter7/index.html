<h1>Chapter 7</h1>
<h2>FURTHER POLITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PRESS</h2>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having briefly reflected on relationships between politicians and the press from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perspectives of our last five Prime Ministers and brought the narrative up to the present, I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">turn in this Chapter to the viewpoint of a number of politicians currently occupying senior</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">positions in UK national life, whose perspectives were of particular interest to the work of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry. The evidence of the Rt Hon Theresa May MP, the Home Secretary, is covered in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Part G of the Report.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having concluded the last chapter with the perspective of the current Prime Minister, I turn</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">next to the views of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the Liberal Democrat party,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">before moving on to consider the views of the Leader of the Opposition and of the First</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Minister of Scotland. The section concludes with the evidence of a number of contemporary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cabinet Members about their relationships with senior figures in the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry benefited greatly from all of these unique perspectives. As set out below, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal experiences and approaches of some of these witnesses to handling relationships</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the press were of particular interest in themselves.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is inevitable that I have been highly selective (although, I hope, fair) in highlighting a very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">few aspects of the evidence which appear to me to be of particular interest for the purposes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Inquiry. I have also largely confined myself to the words of the witnesses, rather than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">upon any commentary or debate about their perspectives either as received by the Inquiry or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which have emerged elsewhere. Again, there is no need for me to do so, and there are other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">places (not least Parliament and the press) in which the contest of perspectives about these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matters can be seen and understood more fully by the public than in the pages of this Report.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. The Deputy Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Nick Clegg MP</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clegg&#8217;s evidence was of value not only from the perspective of his current senior position</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the coalition Government, but also as leader of the UK&#8217;s &#8216;third party&#8217;. Over the period</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">consideredin thepreviousChaptersofthisReport,theLiberalDemocratsandtheirpredecessor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political organisations, being neither in Government nor in the position of Official Opposition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">party, could be expected to have had a very different experience of personal relationships</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at senior levels between the political leadership and senior figures in the press. Mr Clegg</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reminded the Inquiry that the Liberal Democrats had never been politically supported by any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the News International titles, and had enjoyed express endorsement, only in recent years</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and to a degree, from The Independent, the Guardian and the Observer. He also reminded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry of his highly personal experience of press coverage in the run-up to the 2010</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">general election.</span>
<a name="page1414"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clegg underlined that, in these historical circumstances, he regarded himself and his party</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as removed from the sort of relationship others might have had, with News International in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> He said this about relationships between politicians and the press more generally:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;But it&#8217;s really at the end of the day for politicians to stand up for themselves and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">say: look, we have a democratic mandate, we&#8217;ve gone out to get elected, we listen</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to our constituents in our surgeries every Thursday, Friday, Saturday. The editors,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the proprietors don&#8217;t do that. We get out and about in the country much more, by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the way, than many of the journalists who constantly pronounce on the state of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">country. I just think a bit of &#8211; an assertion of the legitimacy of politicians to make</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decisions in their own right, unfettered, unintimidated, unpressured, would probably</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">go further than almost anything else in making sure the balance is correctly set.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clegg emphasised the sheer importance of interaction between press and politicians:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I can&#8217;t stress enough&#8230; the idea that politicians and the press should operate in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hermetically sealed silos separate from each other is completely unrealistic and it&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">totally right they should seek each other out. It&#8217;s just the manner in which they do so</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the spirit in which they approach each other.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He also underlined the value of the press acting as &#8216;a very important corrective in the political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system&#8217;,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> putting that in context in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think the balance to strike, however, is to make sure that politicians are not too &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">how can I put it? Not too weak-kneed in face of pressure which they don&#8217;t agree with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or is unwarranted or is unjustified in a mature democracy. The pressure is one thing.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Intimidation is another. And I think it&#8217;s very important to point the finger not just at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the press but the political class. The more the political class allow themselves over</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">time to be intimidated or cajoled or pressured, of course the more it becomes a self-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fulfilling prophecy.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clegg&#8217;s advice to the Inquiry was to recommend a series of &#8216;quite precise proposals&#8217; which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would not be the subject of &#8216;endless political argy-bargy&#8217; and would stand a good chance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cross-party support.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> He underlined, in addition, that the future for press standards &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> has</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to be independent regulation, independent of government, Parliament, politicians and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">media, with teeth&#8221;;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> saw</span><span style="font-style:normal"> independence</span><span style="font-style:normal"> from</span><span style="font-style:normal"> both</span><span style="font-style:normal"> press</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> politicians</span><span style="font-style:normal"> as</span><span style="font-style:normal"> important,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other words, for a proper and effective system of press standards which would command</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public confidence.</span>

<h2>3.  The Leader of the Opposition, the Rt Hon Ed Miliband  MP</h2>


<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his interviews and public statements following the phone-hacking revelations in July 2011,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Miliband acknowledged that politicians had become &#8216;too close&#8217; to News International.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He was asked in oral evidence to explain precisely what he meant by that, and he said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve obviously read a lot of the evidence you&#8217;ve had and thought a lot about this. I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think the way I very specifically view this &#8211; I believe the thing I&#8217;m looking for is the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interview I gave to Andrew Marr, actually, just after the phone hacking Milly Dowler</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">scandal broke, because I believe I said in that interview that we were too close, in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sense that it meant that when there were abuses by the press, we didn&#8217;t speak out.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">That is my version of &#8220;too close&#8221;, my view of the consequence of &#8220;too close&#8221;. Now,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">different people &#8211; the reason I say I refer to your other evidence is different people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have used different phrases for that word. Mandelson said &#8220;cowed&#8221;, Tony Blair said</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;unhealthy&#8221;. There&#8217;s a whole range of other adjectives that have been used. I suspect</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they may be more accurate as ways of thinking about this issue, that it was a sense</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of fear, I suppose, in some sense, or unwillingness or worry, anxiety about speaking</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">out on those issues, issues that were affecting ordinary members of the public, issues</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">where I think that if it had been any other organisation in another walk of life that had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been perpetrating some of what happened, action would have been taken earlier.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Imadeaconnection betweenthisanalysisandsomeoftheevidenceIhadheardfromprevious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prime Ministers, including Sir John Major and Mr Blair. The latter, for example, explained that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for him &#8216;too close&#8217; should not necessarily be taken to suggest something which was amicable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">andcollaborative;thepowerofthepresswasalsoexperiencedassomethingcreatingadegree</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ofcircumspection in dealingwith mattersaffectingthepress&#8217;sownreputation and commercial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interests. I understood Mr Miliband&#8217;s comments in that context; that this experience of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">power of the press led to a correlative reticence in politicians, an unwillingness to speak out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about problems in the culture, practices and ethics of the press, including those exposed in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence to the Inquiry. Mr Miliband was including himself in that analysis.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He said that when senior politicians did decide to speak out, this was perceived as &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic"> crossing</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a Rubicon because this would be seen by News International as pretty much an act of war&#8217;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">His assessment was that issues of power and influence could not be divorced from issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the concentration of market share in a limited number of hands and the associated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">megaphone effect, and that issues of press misconduct equally could not be divorced from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the fact of economic power, since it created:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...[a] sense of power without responsibility, which is what I believe it was, came</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from the fact that they controlled 37 per cent of the newspaper market before the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">closure of the News of the World, and I don&#8217;t think we can divorce these questions</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of ownership, quasi-monopoly et cetera, from &#8211; or at least concentration of power,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">better put than &#8220;quasi-monopoly&#8221; &#8211; concentration of power &#8211; I don&#8217;t think we can</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">divorce those questions from the behaviour of some parts of the press. And add in,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by the way, the Sky platform, which then became &#8211; and Sky. All that became an issue</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He set out his commitment to do everything in his power to seek to work on a cross-party</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">basis to ensure that the Inquiry&#8217;s recommendations provided a basis for the future of press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation. As he put it:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think we have a huge responsibility and I want to say, really, echoing something you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">said at the beginning of this week and something that Tony Blair said in his testimony,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that for any Prime Minister this is going to be very difficult and I want to say that I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">will do everything I can to seek to work on a cross-party basis so ensure that your</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recommendations provide a framework for us for the future.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the question of his personal approach, Mr Miliband was asked about his dealings with Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch and in particular his attendance at the News International summer party on 16 June</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2011. He said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I say I recall a relatively short conversation with Rupert Murdoch for a few minutes</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at the summer party. I believe it was about US politics and international affairs, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I believe I should have raised the issue of phone hacking with him. I didn&#8217;t, which is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">something I think I said last summer.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his written evidence, Mr Miliband was asked to explain the circumstances in which he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hired Tom Baldwin as Director of Communications of the Labour Party on December 2010. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Baldwin had previously worked at The Times for about 11 years. Mr Miliband&#8217;s explanation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A number of candidates were considered. In respect of the role which Tom was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">appointed to fill we were looking for someone with significant experience as a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalist, with an outstanding understanding of the world of politics, and, crucially</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as far as I was concerned, with a genuine commitment to the values of the Labour</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">Party.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">My then Acting Chief of Staff, Lucy Powell, and I spoke to a number of colleagues,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">associates and others in whose judgement we had confidence &#8211; including fellow</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">politicians and media experts &#8211; in connection to Tom, and other candidates&#8217;, suitability</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for the role(s) prior to appointing him. At no point did anyone raise concerns about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Tom&#8217;s journalistic integrity. Indeed the opposite was the case ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Tom Baldwin&#8217;s connection to News International was as an employee of Times</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Newspapers Limited in which News international has a controlling interest. He was</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not someone who had close or privileged relationships with the senior executives</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at News International. His connections with News International played no role in,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and had no significance for, his recruitment. He was employed for his skills and his</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">commitment to the Labour party. Neither I nor my Chief of Staff had any conversations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about Tom&#8217;s recruitment with executives of News International.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Before offering Tom Baldwin the job he and I discussed whether there were any</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Ashcroft&#8217;s book &#8220;Dirty Times, Dirty Politics&#8221; which was first published in 2005. I should</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">underline that the book contains no allegations &#8220;linking Mr Baldwin to the unlawful</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and unethical acquisition of information&#8221;. Lord Ashcroft refers in his book to Tom</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Baldwin being given information about some of Lord Ashcroft&#8217;s financial affairs some</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">time after its acquisition by Times Newspapers in defence of a legal action against the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">paper by Lord Ashcroft.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The more serious allegation that Tom Baldwin had himself commissioned the blagging</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of this information was made only subsequently by Lord Ashcroft in a blog in summer</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">last year when Tom Baldwin had already been working for me for six months. When</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this was raised with Tom Baldwin (including by me) he made it absolutely clear that it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was entirely false. My Acting Chief of Staff followed up with the Editor of the Times at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the time of the events Lord Ashcroft describes &#8211; Sir Peter Stothard. He made it clear</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that in his view Lord Ashcroft&#8217;s allegation was false. He went out of his way to praise</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Tom Baldwin&#8217;s professional integrity and journalistic acumen.&#8221;</span>

<h2>4.  The First Minister of Scotland, the Rt Hon Alex Salmond MSP</h2>


<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As I have explained,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup> although the remit of this Inquiry extends to all parts of the UK, I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not sought to make any recommendations of exclusive application to Scotland (or indeed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Wales or Northern Ireland). As for Scotland, the pattern of devolved and reserved competence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in media matters in Scotland is not straightforward. For example, broadcasting regulation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and competition rules in Scotland fall to be dealt with on a &#8216;reserved&#8217; basis (that is on a UK-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wide basis, with decision-making resting with the UK Government and Parliament). Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards, and the commercial interests of the press more generally, fall to be considered on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a &#8216;devolved&#8217; basis: the Scottish Government and Parliament can choose either to make their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">own policy and law for national application or to support a UK-wide approach. What follows</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">must be considered with that in mind.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Salmond was asked about his expectations from the Inquiry in terms of the application of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its recommendations to Scotland. He said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, I think that rather depends on what the Inquiry comes up with, Mr Jay. If the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Inquiry comes up with a proposition which accords with public support, which is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">eminently sensible and points the way to a better future, then I think the Scottish</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Parliament would be very foolish not to pay close attention to it. If on the other hand,</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which I don&#8217;t believe for a minute will happen, it came up with a solution which was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">either over-prescriptive, restricted press liberty, then I think the Scottish Parliament</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">might wish not to apply that. So I think that rather depends on the proposition that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">emerges from this Inquiry. I wish you well in the deliberations and I assure you we&#8217;re</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">looking with enormous interest.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Salmond said this, by way of his general views on his personal approach to relationships</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within the press:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup></span>

<a name="page1418"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. ... [s]o are we to understand by that that you will seek to persuade newspapers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to modify their editorial or reporting stance to reflect the interests of either yourself</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or your party?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Oh yes. I mean, I don&#8217;t know of any politician I&#8217;ve ever come across who &#8211; well,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">if anybody doesn&#8217;t answer yes to that question, they certainly shouldn&#8217;t be under</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">oath at an Inquiry. All politicians try quite legitimately and properly to influence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapers to treat them or their party, or in the case of myself, their cause of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Scottish independence, more favourably. That&#8217;s not the only reason for meeting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">editors. Often there are meetings about specific issues, specific campaigns, things</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that are important to that newspaper or important to the government, and a range</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of these meetings would be covered by that category.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Salmond spoke about his relationship with Rupert Murdoch: they had evidently made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significant personal connections. They shared Scottish roots and heritage. Mr Murdoch&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">grandfather was a Church of Scotland Minister within Mr Salmond&#8217;s old constituency.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Murdoch told the Inquiry that he was &#8216;intrigued&#8217; by the notion of Scottish independence,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and it is also clear that, over time, he came to be impressed by Mr Salmond&#8217;s ideas and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political acumen.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The personal element of the relationship evidently dated from relatively recent years.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Salmond told the Inquiry that he recalled one telephone conversation with Mr Murdoch</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in November 2000, shortly after the US Presidential election, but that there was then no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal contact between them for nearly seven years.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Scottish Sun, a News International title, was anti-SNP at the 2007 election (as indeed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was the Daily Record). Mr Salmond&#8217;s relationship with Mr Murdoch changed after the 2007</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">election.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-7"><a href="#para4-7" name="para4-7">4.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Bearing in mind the public interest in the transparency of relationship between senior</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians (particularly in government) and senior figures in the press, on 4 August 2011</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Salmond had volunteered to publish a list of his meetings with newspaper proprietors,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editors and media executives over the preceding years.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup> This list, together with more recent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence to the Inquiry, shows that Mr Salmond and Mr Murdoch met on five occasions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">over a five year period. The tone of these meetings was said to be warm and friendly.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup> Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Salmond also had two meetings with James Murdoch.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-8"><a href="#para4-8" name="para4-8">4.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is apparent from the evidence that these meetings and conversations covered topics such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as common heritage, the issue of Scottish independence, and (although the evidence was less</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear about this) corporation tax rates in Scotland. Doubtless Mr Salmond had the opportunity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on these occasions to explain to Mr Murdoch the advantages, as he saw them, of Scottish</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">independence to the latter&#8217;s commercial interests. He also invited Mr Murdoch to sporting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">events and the theatre. Significantly, on Mr Murdoch&#8217;s side there was an invitation for Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Salmond to be the guest of honour at the formal opening of New International&#8217;s Eurocentral</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">printing plant on 30 October 2007.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">hopeful that The Scottish Sun would support him in the May 2011 election, and his evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was that the issue was raised with the Murdochs, for him to be told by them that it was a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matter for the editors:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Did you ever discuss with Rupert Murdoch or James Murdoch support by their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapers in Scotland for your party?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I find certainly with Rupert Murdoch and with James Murdoch as well that if you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">do that, what they&#8217;d say was, &#8220;Go to the editors&#8221;, and that&#8217;s what they say, so you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">just assume that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to be said, and they&#8217;re perfectly right to say that and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">therefore that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve done.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Can we be clear on how many occasions then you have raised the issue with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Rupert Murdoch and James Murdoch? Are you able to assist us?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I wouldn&#8217;t explicitly raise it at meetings necessarily, because they&#8217;d always say,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Go to the editors&#8221;. That certainly was Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s practice, and I can&#8217;t even</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">remember, it may have cropped up in a James Murdoch meeting, but if so, he would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">say, &#8220;Go to the editors&#8221;, and go to the editors I did, as I say, sometimes successfully</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and sometimes not.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. But that answer presupposes that you made a direct request statement to James</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Murdoch or Rupert Murdoch, &#8220;Would your papers support me?&#8221; and their answer is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">always, &#8220;Go and speak to the editors&#8221;; is that right?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. No, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever done it explicitly like that. It would be something like, &#8220;I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">take it I have to go and speak to the editors to get support for my point of view&#8221;. Much</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more like that. It&#8217;s chicken and egg. That&#8217;s been the position certainly throughout &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not just in the meetings I&#8217;ve had with Rupert Murdoch more recently in the last five</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">years, but even if we go back to 2000, 2001. I mean, I can&#8217;t speak for other people&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">experience, but that&#8217;s been consistently what he says, so you just accept that&#8217;s what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he&#8217;s going to say and therefore you anticipate that, so you don&#8217;t actually &#8211; I don&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think I&#8217;ve ever explicitly asked him for support for the party because the answer would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be, &#8220;Go to the editors and argue the position.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. In your witness statement, the way you formulate it at 13987, eight lines from</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the top of the page, you say quite generally: &#8220;In relation to questions about support</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from particular titles, any such discussion with Rupert or James Murdoch was always</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">met with a request to talk directly to the relevant editorial team.&#8221; So you&#8217;re making</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it clear there that if &#8211; or rather when you raised such a request with Rupert or James</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Murdoch, they told you to go and speak to the editors?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I refer back to what I said a couple of minutes ago. I think probably the way I put</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it was &#8220;I take it I should go and see the sub-editor or go and see the Times editor or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">go and see the Sunday Times editor.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">It was also put to Mr Salmond that the editorial direction for The Scottish Sun came from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rupert Murdoch. His answer was:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Not according to Mr Murdoch. Mr Murdoch would say he was maybe part of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">discussions, but it was up to the editors. He would always say that.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-11"><a href="#para4-11" name="para4-11">4.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In early March 2011 Mr Salmond made his &#8216;pitch&#8217; to the editorial team of The Scottish Sun,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and support from that paper was forthcoming later that month. Although Mr Salmond&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understanding was that Mr Murdoch&#8217;s editors rather than Mr Murdoch personally would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decide which party to support, Mr Murdoch&#8217;s evidence to the Inquiry was that, although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he could not recall the matter specifically, The Scottish Sun&#8217;s decision was one to which he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contributed, and he was also able to explain the basis for it.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup> Immediately after the general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">election the editor, Mr Dinsmore, wrote a personal letter of congratulation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of mutual respect and admiration, notwithstanding the fact that it was not built on frequent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interactions between the two (very busy) men. Mr Murdoch could no doubt appreciate that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he was dealing with a politician of considerable skill, resource and intelligence, and he may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also have felt, and perhaps continues to believe, that the aims of the SNP are consistent with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the long-term objectives of both News International and News Corp in Scotland. Mr Salmond</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clearly saw the advantages of securing political support from News International and The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Scottish Sun, notwithstanding that the 2007 election had led to his becoming First Minister of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a Coalition Government without support from The Scottish Sun or the Daily Record; and he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would no doubt wish to do all that was properly within his power to achieve that.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-13"><a href="#para4-13" name="para4-13">4.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Salmond had been particularly keen to ensure that the Terms of Reference for this Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should make explicit reference to the missed opportunity afforded by Operation Motorman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to address problems in the culture, practices and ethics of the press. He said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, I am concerned with it because I think there&#8217;s a connecting thread which is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that what seemed to me to be substantive evidence of illegality or illegal practices</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which was contained in the Information Commissioner &#8211; the English and Welsh</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Information Commissioner&#8217;s report, Richard Thomas, I think, of December 2006 had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been not left unlooked at because there had been a limited number of prosecutions,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but even, for example, his proposal that breaches of data protection should be an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">indictable offence, as we call it in Scotland, and it&#8217;s the same in England, you know,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had been left, and most recently the revelations on hacking, I mean the connection</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is obviously that there was a substantial body of evidence that there had been a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sequence of perhaps systematic illegal practices going on, and the response of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">law and those who have responsibility for pursuing these things, whether the police</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or the prosecution services, had not been adequate, and therefore I suggested to the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Secretary of State that an explicit reference in the terms of reference to Operation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Motorman would be helpful in making it clear that this was one key aspect, I hoped,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the Inquiry&#8217;s consideration, and now as it happens, as you know, it was argued to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">me that it didn&#8217;t have to be explicit because it was already implicit within the terms</span>

<a name="page1421"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of reference and fair enough &#8230; . I was really thinking of illegal practices. I think it&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">possible to consider &#8211; clearly this Inquiry is considering practices which are improper</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but not necessarily illegal. I mean, there are ways to access people&#8217;s data which are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not illegal and it might be argued that&#8217;s a perfectly proper way to do things. You</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">might &#8211; but I wouldn&#8217;t put my senses on that. I was really driving at the illegality as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">opposed to the propriety.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-14"><a href="#para4-14" name="para4-14">4.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Salmond had this to say about the future:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;First, and I would give primacy to this, is to uphold the law. I think it&#8217;s &#8211; my view is it&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">extraordinary of the various aspects of this that I&#8217;ve spoken about that an assumed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">illegality can have been taking place on a huge scale and nothing substantial done</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about it. I made the point earlier about the lack of information that had been given</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the Scottish authorities, which I feel very angry about. I can give you the assurance</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that&#8217;s been given to me by the Lord Advocate that the criminal law will be upheld in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Scotland without fear and favour, and I&#8217;m sure, given the circumstances in which this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Inquiry has come into being, that will now be the case everywhere, but it has to be the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">case because, unless that&#8217;s the case, nothing else that&#8217;s suggested &#8211; I go back to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">point &#8211; a voluntary or even a statutory code is not going to be enforced or enforceable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">if the criminal law is not being enforced and enforceable so I think it&#8217;s absolutely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">invites that that&#8217;s first in my hierarchy.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Secondly &#8211; and maybe this is maybe why you think I&#8217;m a minimalist in this matter</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; I think the freedom of the press is important not just as a matter of practice but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as a matter of principle. And while I salute and applaud those newspapers like, for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">example, the ones I mentioned in DC Thomson and there are others, who make an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">absolute virtue of saying, look, comments are in our editorial or in our columnists,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fact is in our news columns. That&#8217;s great, but it may be desirable but not only is the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">impossible to implement, in my opinion, this division between fact and comment, I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">actually do think there is a freedom for people within the law, the laws of not inciting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hatred, to conduct themselves in a biased manner. It was Lord Northcliffe, wasn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it, who the phrase the &#8220;daily hate&#8221; was attributed to, but whether it&#8217;s hate or bias,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whatever you want to call it, I think that&#8217;s a price we have to pay for the essential</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">freedom of the press and you cannot have a free press which does what you want it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to do, which always behaves itself. It has to behave itself within the law and within</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">certain norms, which I&#8217;m going to come onto in a few seconds.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Thirdly, in terms of redress from &#8211; well, the redress for illegal behaviour is clear</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enough, that should be a matter for criminal law to enforce that, but from other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">behaviour which might not be illegal but be wrong, then certainly on that, the redress</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">must be open to all. There has to be the ability of individuals or groups, in my opinion,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to seek redress in an effective manner they can have confidence in. Rich people and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">powerful people will always have the civil courts and actions that they can pursue,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but to be proper, the redress must be open to all. Fourthly, politicians. I think the move</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">towards transparency is a good thing for both government and opposition politicians.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think the abidance by the Ministerial Code is &#8211; the Ministerial Codes are there for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a reason and the reason I cited you to Scottish Ministerial Code is because we pay it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">close attention and so politicians and relationships should be guided by transparency</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in terms of what is now being done by everyone &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Is the Scottish Code in your exhibits?</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref30" name="footnote30" title="Go back to footnote reference 30 in the text">30</a>.  pp98-101, lines 9-14, <em>ibid</em></p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1422"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I cited it earlier on, sir. If we haven&#8217;t made it an exhibit, then I shall make sure it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">is done.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: I&#8217;d be grateful if you could send me a copy.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. And obviously the differences would tend to be it stresses areas where the Scottish</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ministers have particular competence, like the one on jobs and investment that I read</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">out to you. But following the Ministerial Code is my fourth point. &#8211;&#8221;</span>

<h2>5. The Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke QC MP</h2>

<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Kenneth Clarke QC MP provided a number of different perspectives. In particular, as Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chancellor and Justice Secretary at the time, his Cabinet portfolio included a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matters of central concern to the Inquiry, including substantive and procedural law on both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the civil and criminal sides, access to justice more generally, and data protection law and</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">policy.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He said this about the political response to Operation Motorman:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">&#8220;Thatwasthestartlingthing,butIdon&#8217;tthinkyoucanputthatdowntotheInformation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Commissioner. The Motorman reports were pretty startling, and rather going back to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what I said before, what is known in the bubble and what&#8217;s known outside, I think</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">every knew that private and confidential information was fairly readily available in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the outside world as long as you were prepared to pay for it, and the Commissioner</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">produced these two reports and not much was done about it, but it goes beyond, I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think, just the penalties and the powers of the Information Commissioner.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. You say not much was done about it. What other reasons do you think exist for why</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not much was done about it?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Well, it&#8217;s no good mentioning my pet theories because I don&#8217;t know for sure, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what this Inquiry is looking into, how far was it a desire, for one reason or another,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not to upset the people who were happily indulging in all this? I won&#8217;t go further.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It&#8217;s not totally new, all this. When I was first appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I had to move my bank account because my bank complained to me that journalists</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were trying to bribe the staff of the village branch where I had my bank account. It</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would have been regarded as perfectly customary in those days, I think particularly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as the Chancellor of the Exchequer who had been appointed had views which weren&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">shared by some the editors of the more vigorous newspapers. So that and various</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other things happened. And in business everybody was perfectly well aware that if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you wanted to engage in these sort of practices, it was terrible easy to get details of</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the private information of your competitors or rivals, and journalists joined in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">same thing. The scale of it appears to become startling. Motorman sort of made</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people aware this had now grown to a very profitable and large industry, and even</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">following through the newspapers the evidence given to this Inquiry, the scale has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">certainly shocked me, when I would have thought I was fairly worldly wise on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">subject in previous years, but I had no idea it was going on on this monumental scale.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-3"><a href="#para5-3" name="para5-3">5.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke spoke in these general terms about relationships at senior levels between the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians and the press:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup></span>

<a name="page1423"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, what falls in force with your remit is as it were the proprietors of it, isn&#8217;t it? I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mean, how far is undue influence being exercised for commercial, well, political, other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reasons? The politics are quite difficult because in the end it is for the politicians to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decide how far they&#8217;re going to allow a particular powerful group to influence policy.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">If I&#8217;m sounding &#8211; every democratically elected politician in every part of the world</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I&#8217;ve ever known easily falls to criticising the press, so if I sound as if I&#8217;m criticising the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press, my criticisms are actually aimed equally at the ministers.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: I understand that.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. When taken to excess, this terror of the tabloids and this subservience to the media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">doesn&#8217;t give any success to the politician who does it. You may win some temporary</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">praise, but you make stupid decisions in government and they turn on you eventually</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">when it starts to fall apart. You still come to the same ruin in the end unless you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">actually make a decent fist of the good governance of the country.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Well, in my opinion the power of the media has grown, is excessive, and ought to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">diminished, although I think the remedy is as much in the hands of the politicians as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">others. On the other hand, I still want to have a free media, an aggressive media, an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">irreverent media, and one that continually questions the government&#8217;s own estimate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of itself, so you have to get the balance right between those two.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-4"><a href="#para5-4" name="para5-4">5.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of particular interest was the example that Mr Clarke was able to provide relating to criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justice policy over recent years which, in his view, &#8216;has been a response to tabloid newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">complaints&#8217;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup> Overall:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;If the tone of the newspapers had been different for the last 15 years, we&#8217;d probably</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have 20,000 fewer prisoners in prison. I hasten to add that&#8217;s not a scientific estimate,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it&#8217;s just a way of illustrating my opinion.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-5"><a href="#para5-5" name="para5-5">5.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He also challenged the theory that the endorsement of political parties from time to time by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Sun really made much difference to the political fortunes, since Rupert Murdoch and his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper tended to align themselves with perceived winners and to change sides<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;when</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was obvious that the horse they&#8217;re riding is about to collapse&#8217;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-6"><a href="#para5-6" name="para5-6">5.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the way forward on press regulation, Mr Clarke observed:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think we&#8217;re all agreed, I don&#8217;t know, you&#8217;ve had many witnesses now, that whoever</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the regulator is must be totally independent of both government and press in their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">activities, that they should have some authority, and the ability to require the relevant</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">media organisations to subject themselves to the authority, and that they should have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the power to impose penalties so there is some practical effect. Financial penalties, I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">imagine, the most part. It&#8217;s when they break the criminal law, it should go off to other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">courts and other jurisdictions to deal with that. If that needs statutory underpinning</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">because you won&#8217;t get everybody to produce something like that and join something</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">like that, submit to something like that and comply with something like that, then</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you&#8217;re going to need statutory underpinning...&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Gove&#8217;s perspective is interesting in two principal respects. First, he is both a senior</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">From the perspective of his experience in journalism, Mr Gove offered some insights into the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship between politicians and the press. He said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref39" href="#footnote39">39</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I can quite understand why Lord Mandelson thought that the relationship between</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">politicians and journalists was a purely transactional one. I prefer to think of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relationship between politicians and journalists as being nuanced and multi-layered.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Sometimes it will be the case that some politicians will regard their interactions with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalists in a transactional fashion, but it can also be the case that friendships can</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">arise and it can certainly be the case that politicians can understand the pressures</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that journalists face in trying to make sure that the public are informed and it can</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">also be the case that journalists can appreciate the pressures that politicians face in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">trying to make sure that their policy is presented fairly.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Thank you. In your view, have we reached the point where the current state of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relationships between journalists and politicians is poisonous or close to it?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">A. No, I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s poisonous.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Have we reached anywhere near that point?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. No, I don&#8217;t believe we have. Of course there&#8217;s acrimony between some journalists</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and some politicians as a result of wrongs or perceived wrongs, but I think that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">idea that the relationship is poisonous is an overstatement.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Are there any aspects of the relationship, if one doesn&#8217;t like the word &#8220;poisonous&#8221;,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">one might characterise as unhealthy?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I think it&#8217;s certainly the case that there are sometimes elements of the relationship</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">between politicians and journalists that can be a little rough-edged. I think that&#8217;s</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">certainly true. And it is also the case that there are some politicians and some</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalists who develop, over time, a close relationship, which may not altogether be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the public interest. But in my experience, most politicians and most journalists have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a proper sense of the boundaries between each.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. So a close relationship which may not altogether be in the public interest, why not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">altogether in the public interest?</span>

<a name="page1425"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. It may be the case sometimes that a relationship between certain journalists and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">certain politicians will involve a journalist or a politician relying one upon the other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for confidences which are not always shared with the public at an appropriate time.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-3"><a href="#para6-3" name="para6-3">6.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Gove provided his personal view of Rupert Murdoch, with whom he clearly has a close</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">affinity. Initially expressing himself in fairly succinct terms (<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> think</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> he</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> one</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">most impressive and significant figures of the last fifty years&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> ),</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> broadened</span><span style="font-style:normal"> his</span><span style="font-style:normal"> insights</span><span style="font-style:normal"> as</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think that the changes that he made to newspaper publishing as a result of his</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decision to relocate his titles to Wapping lowered the barriers to entry for newspapers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and meant that like the Independent, which would never otherwise have existed,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">existed, and as a result more individuals have been employed in journalism. It&#8217;s also</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the case that his investment in satellite television has also created jobs as well, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think that it&#8217;s undoubtedly the case that there are few entrepreneurs who have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">taken risks in the way that he has and therefore generated employment, but also</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">controversy in the way which he has.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. And the generation of controversy, how does that arise or how has that arisen?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. It&#8217;s often the case that successful people invite criticism. He has been successful in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a particular industry, where there are others who are only too happy to criticise, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they have exercised their liberty to do so.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. You described him, consistently with the evidence you&#8217;ve just given, as a force of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nature, a phenomenon and, I think, a great man. That&#8217;s right, isn&#8217;t it?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes, it is. I enjoyed meeting him when I was a journalist, I subsequently enjoyed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">meeting him when way a politician and I would also say that as well as having been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a successful businessman, I think that the position that he took on, for example, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">European single currency, has been vindicated by events.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Have you ever expressed a view on the merits of the BSkyB bid, Mr Gove?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Never to any of my political colleagues, no.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. So insofar as you held a view about it, by definition it would have been a private</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">view?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">A. Correct.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-4"><a href="#para6-4" name="para6-4">6.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Gove was taken at some length<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup> through documentary evidence which related to Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch&#8217;s interest in investing in free schools and academies, and his own involvement in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that project. Some commentators have seen this evidence as a legitimate cause for concern</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">about what may have appeared to be an &#8216;overly close&#8217; relationship between Government and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proprietors in which matters of Government policy are transacted in the context of friendly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal relationships. Although the evidence was explored in detail with a view to testing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that proposition, no substantive grounds for public concern were established. Although Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch&#8217;s commercial interests were clearly engaged at one level, Mr Gove expressed a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear view that Mr Murdoch&#8217;s interests, such as they were, in the free school movement were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">essentially philanthropic.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup> In any event, nothing came of Mr Murdoch&#8217;s interest; the project</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">foundered for want of local authority funding support.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup></span>

<h2>7. The Rt Hon George Osborne MP</h2>

<p id="para-id-7-1"><a href="#para7-1" name="para7-1">7.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Osborne&#8217;s contemporary involvement in the appointment of Andy Coulson and in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">BSkyB bid have been addressed elsewhere.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-2"><a href="#para7-2" name="para7-2">7.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Osborne explained that he had a number of good friends who were journalists and with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whom he enjoyed political discussion.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup> In his written evidence he provided details of his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meetings and social interactions with media proprietors and senior editorial and executive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">staff, between 2005 and 2010.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup> Approximately one-third of these were with representatives</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of News International. Asked, by way of example, about a dinner hosted by Rebekah Brooks</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on 19 December 2009 and attended by Rupert and James Murdoch, Mr Osborne said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;<span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic"> I&#8217;m</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic"> sure</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic"> political</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic"> matters</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic"> were</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic"> discussed.</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic"> mean,</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic"> they</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic"> normally</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic"> were.</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic"> don&#8217;t</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">remember any improper conversation or any conversation about the commercial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interests of News Corp or News International. I think it was a general discussion about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the political situation in Britain as we were heading into a General Election year and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">indeed the economic situation with the rest of the world. I mean, normally when</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Rupert Murdoch was at one of these events, the conversation was about the global</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">economy and at the time, of course, we were right in the middle of the financial crisis.&#8217;</span>
