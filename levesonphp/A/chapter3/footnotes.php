 <?php footNote('A',3,8); ?> Writing in the Observer on 2 September 2012 (http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/02/simon-fox-trinity-music-man-record?INTCMP=SRCH), Peter Preston said that I was &#8220;s praying&#8221; a &#8220;confidentia l&#8221; 118-page letter of early  criticisms around Fleet Street which had been described as a &#8220;diatribe&#8221;, a &#8220;completely one-sided&#8221; attack that resembles  &#8220;loading a gun&#8221; and &#8220;excoriating&#8221;. He suggested that my disappointment that my comments were being openly  discussed in the press was an indication that &#8220;he still doesn&#8217;t quite get it&#8221; so that he suffers &#8220;just &#8216;disappointment&#8217; if  it doesn&#8217;t leak instantly&#8221;. It might also simply demonstrate that not enough care has been taken to understand the  process and to comply with sensible obligations specifically designed to be fair to all </p>
