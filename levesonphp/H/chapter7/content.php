<h1 id="top">CHAPTER 7<br/>SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS</h1>
 <?php paragraphLink('H',7,1,1); ?>I am conscious of both the length and complexity of this Part of the Report. For ease of reference, I have decided to place all my recommendations in summary form at the conclusion of this Part rather than to follow the approach I have pursued elsewhere.  <strong>I recommend to the Ministry of Justice that: </strong></p>
 <div class="recommend">
  <p>The exemption in section 32 of the Data Protection Act 1998 should be amended so  as to make it available only where:<?php footnoteRef('H',7,1); ?>  
  <ol type="a">
<li>the processing of data is necessary for publication, rather than simply being in  fact undertaken with a view to publication;  </li>
<li>the data controller reasonably believes that the relevant publication would be  or is in the public interest, with no special weighting of the balance between the  public interest in freedom of expression and in privacy; and  </li>
<li>objectively, that the likely interference with privacy resulting from the processing  of the data is outweighed by the public interest in publication.  </li>
</ol>
</p>
</div>
<div class="recommend">
<p>The exemption in section 32 of the Data Protection Act 1998 should be narrowed in  scope, so that it no longer allows, by itself, for exemption from:<?php footnoteRef('H',7,2); ?>
<ol type="a">
<li>the requirement of the first data protection principle to process personal data  fairly (except in relation to the provision of information to the data subject under  paragraph 2(1)(a) of Part II Schedule 1 to the 1998 Act) and in accordance with  statute law;  </li>
<li>the second data protection principle (personal data to be obtained only for  specific purposes and not processed incompatibly with those purposes);  </li>
<li>the fourth data protection principle (personal data to be accurate and kept up to  date);  </li>
<li>the sixth data protection principle (personal data to be processed in accordance  with the rights of individuals under the Act);  </li>
<li>the eighth data protection principle (restrictions on exporting personal data);  and  </li>
<li>the right of subject access. </li>
</ol>
 The recommendation on the removal of the right of subject access from the scope  of section 32 is subject to any necessary clarification that the law relating to the  protection of journalists&#8217; sources is not affected by the Act.  </p>
 </div>
 <div class="recommend"> 
 <p>It should be made clear that the right to compensation for distress conferred by  section 13 of the Data Protection Act 1998 is not restricted to cases of pecuniary loss,  but should include compensation for pure distress.<?php footnoteRef('H',7,3); ?> </p>
 </div>
 <div class="recommend">
 <p>The procedural provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 with special application to  journalism in:  
 <ol type="a">
<li>section 32(4) and (5)  </li>
<li>sections 44 to 46 inclusive</li>  should be repealed.<?php footnoteRef('H',7,4); ?> 
</ol>
</p>
</div>
<div class="recommend">
 <p> In conjunction with the repeal of those procedural provisions, consideration should  be given to the desirability of including in the Data Protection Act 1998 a provision  to the effect that, in considering the exercise of any powers in relation to the media  or other publishers, the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office should have special  regard to the obligation in law to balance the public interest in freedom of expression  alongside the public interest in upholding the data protection regime.<?php footnoteRef('H',7,5); ?> </p>
 </div>
 <div class="recommend">
 <p> Specific provision should be made to the effect that, in considering the exercise  of any of its powers in relation to the media or other publishers, the Information  Commissioner&#8217;s Office must have regard to the application to a data controller of  any relevant system of regulation or standards enforcement which is contained in or  recognised by statute.<?php footnoteRef('H',7,6); ?></p>
 </div>
 <div class="recommend">
 <p>  The necessary steps should be taken to bring into force the amendments made to  section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998 by section 77 of the Criminal Justice and  Immigration Act 2008 (increase of sentence maxima) to the extent of the maximum  specified period; and by section 78 of the 2008 Act (enhanced defence for public  interest journalism).<?php footnoteRef('H',7,7); ?> </p>
 </div>
 <div class="recommend">
<p>  The prosecution powers of the Information Commissioner should be extended to  include any offence which also constitutes a breach of the data protection principles.<?php footnoteRef('H',7,8); ?> </p>
</div>
<div class="recommend">
  <p> A new duty should be introduced (whether formal or informal) for the Information  Commissioner&#8217;s Office to consult with the Crown Prosecution Service in relation to  the exercise of its powers to undertake criminal proceedings.<?php footnoteRef('H',7,9); ?></p>
  </div>
  <div class="recommend">
  <p>The opportunity should be taken to consider amending the Data Protection Act 1998  formally to reconstitute the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office as an Information  Commission, led by a Board of Commissioners with suitable expertise drawn  from the worlds of regulation, public administration, law and business, and active  consideration should be given in that context to the desirability of including on the  Board a Commissioner from the media sector.<?php footnoteRef('H',7,10); ?> </p>
  </div>
 <p> <strong> I recommend to the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office that:</strong></p>
  <div class="recommend">
  <p>The Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office should take immediate steps to prepare, adopt  and publish a policy on the exercise of its formal regulatory functions in order to ensure  that the press complies with the legal requirements of the data protection regime.<?php footnoteRef('H',7,11); ?> </p>
  </div>
  <div class="recommend">
  <p> In discharge of its functions and duties to promote good practice in areas of public  concern, the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office should take immediate steps, in  consultation with the industry, to prepare and issue comprehensive good practice  guidelines and advice on appropriate principles and standards to be observed by the  press in the processing of personal data. This should be prepared and implemented  within six months from the date of this Report.<?php footnoteRef('H',7,12); ?> </p>
  </div>
  <div class="recommend">
  <p> The Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office should take steps to prepare and issue  guidance to the public on their individual rights in relation to the obtaining and use  by the press of their personal data, and how to exercise those rights.<?php footnoteRef('H',7,13); ?> </p>
  </div>
  <div class="recommend">
  <p> In particular, the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office should take immediate steps to  publish advice aimed at individuals (data subjects) concerned that their data have or  may have been processed by the press unlawfully or otherwise than in accordance  with good practice.<?php footnoteRef('H',7,14); ?> </p>
  </div>
  <div class="recommend">
  <p> The Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office, in the Annual Report to Parliament which  it is required to make by virtue of section 52(1) of the Act, should include regular  updates on the effectiveness of the foregoing measures, and on the culture, practices  and ethics of the press in relation to the processing of personal data.<?php footnoteRef('H',7,15); ?>  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="recommend">
  <p>The Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office should immediately adopt the Guidelines for  Prosecutors on assessing the public interest in cases affecting the media, issued by  the Director of Public Prosecutions in September 2012.<?php footnoteRef('H',7,16); ?>  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="recommend">
  <p>The Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office should take immediate steps to engage with  the Metropolitan Police on the preparation of a long-term strategy in relation to  alleged media crime with a view to ensuring that the Office is well placed to fulfil  any necessary role in this respect in the future, and in particular in the aftermath of  Operations Weeting, Tuleta and Elveden.<?php footnoteRef('H',7,17); ?></p>
  </div>
  <div class="recommend">
  <p>The Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office should take the opportunity to review the  availability to it of specialist legal and practical knowledge of the application of the  data protection regime to the press, and to any extent necessary address it.<?php footnoteRef('H',7,18); ?></p>
  </div>
  <div class="recommend">
  <p>  The Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office should take the opportunity to review its  organisation and decision-making processes to ensure that large-scale issues, with  both strategic and operational dimensions (including the relationship between the  culture, practices and ethics of the press in relation to personal information on the  one hand, and the application of the data protection regime to the press on the other)  can be satisfactorily considered and addressed in the round.<?php footnoteRef('H',7,19); ?></p>
