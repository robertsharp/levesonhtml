<h2>THE rESpoNSIBILITIES of THE prESS</h2>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Context</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The idea that freedom of expression comes with responsibilities is both obvious and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">entirely familiar. Article 10(2) of the ECHR provides that the right to freedom of expression</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> carries</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> duties</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> responsibilities</span> &#8221;. In part, this is because, as discussed in Chapter 3,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unrestricted speech has the power to harm competing public interests, including the free</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">speech of others. It is also because the press is an institution of considerable power and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exercise of power in a democratic context brings with it proportionate responsibility for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consequences of choices to do so. Moreover, where power is exercised purportedly in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest, then there is a particularly acute responsibility to account for the exercise of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that power to the public in whose name it is exercised.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. Press power and the impact on society</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In order to understand the responsibilities incumbent on the press, it is necessary to consider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the nature of press power and the potential it has to impact on society. One obvious aspect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the power wielded by the press is its capacity for mass communication<span style="font-size: 9px;"> :1</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Mass communication has powers that local, individual, communication does not.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mass communication allows others to criticize, to inform of the failings, crimes, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deceit of the powerful. Mass communication allows agents to assemble, to unite, to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">form dissident movements, to organize and oppose those in power.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is on account of this capacity of the press to communicate to large audiences, that the idea</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the &#8220;megaphone effect&#8221; of the press was invoked with such frequency throughout the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry. The megaphone effect of the press has a tremendous capacity to serve the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest. It is because of the ability of the press to reach a wide audience that it is taken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seriously by, and therefore able to stand up to, other institutions of power.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;[O]ne aspect of the public interest in a free press is that it provides an essential set of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">checks and balances on power (and, more importantly, the abuse of power): in all too</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">many parts of the world the state routinely tortures and murders its citizens, though</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reporting of such facts is strictly prohibited. This can help a vicious regime retain an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">air of legitimacy, or, in some cases, even to present the air of democratic legitimacy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(there are putative democracies which have serious restrictions on press freedom).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Similarly, the there is a public interest in learning of dangers and risks, even where</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">others may wish to conceal them. A powerful industrialist might wish to conceal the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fact that his factories are polluting the water supply, or that his company&#8217;s product</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is carcinogenic. A free press, free of the censorship and restrictions imposed by the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">powerful, thus serves the public interest by its investigative and communicative roles.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This power of the press to reach a wide audience, whilst having the capacity to do great good,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">carries certain risks:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></span>



<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Communication is a relational process, taking place between speaker (or writer)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and audiences. A powerful media, even a powerful free media, can effectively block</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">dissenting voices&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mass communication by the press can block dissenting voices in a number of ways. One is by</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">preventing access to audiences. Access to audiences is integral to the ability of individuals to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">experience the communicative aspects of free speech:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Expression can be done by a lone individual, but communication is essentially</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relational, and involves others. Individual speakers have an interest in being accessible</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to audiences. Communication can be stifled, not by blocking speech, but by blocking</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">access to audiences. For example, suppose a cunning King permits dissenting political</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">views to be expressed, but only at the bottom of a deep mine shaft. Though here,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">strictly speaking, one has an opportunity to express one&#8217;s views, one is not free to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have them heard. Not only do we have an interest in there being an audience for our</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">speech, we also have an interest in our being the audience to others&#8217; speech.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Clearly, if a particular individual or group of individuals are denied access to the press to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">promote their views, their ability to reach audiences is diminished:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Writers of such columns in the press can seek to mitigate these criticisms by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">endeavouring to articulate what they take to be important or widespread lines of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">thought. But this still points to the fact that in terms of self-expression the press</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">only allows a select few to promulgate their views. Although absence of censorship</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">allows others to set up press outlets, in principle the resources required to do this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">effectively limit this opportunity. This argument could be taken further and it could be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">said that the public interest in freedom of expression can even be adversely affected</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by a free press, if certain other conditions hold such that some voices get much more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">prominence than others. In those conditions the power of the press as a medium of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expression may lead to certain views dominating the public sphere and other views</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">being squeezed out.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One consequence is that views expressed through the press megaphone are more likely to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">predominate: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Whether</span><span style="font-style:italic"> something&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> liable</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> noticed,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> what</span><span style="font-style:italic"> effects</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> liable</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other people&#8217;s perceptions must be very relevant&#8221;;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> &#8220;</span> Financial power ensures that one sort of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">idea is more likely to be promoted in the newspapers people read than another sort of idea&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The tendency of views expressed in the press to prevail can be also be explained by a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">second, and related, facet of press power. There is no doubt that the press is considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a voice of authority in society. In many quarters, it has rightly earned a reputation for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accurate and vigorous reporting, independence and holding power to account. It is because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the authoritative quality of the press, combined with its access to mass audiences, that</span>




<span style="font-size: 15px;">communication by the press, as an institution of considerable power, has a significant impact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on society. It can set the news agenda, shape culture and change perceptions:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There is a great deal of difference between &#8216;a bloke down the pub&#8217; claiming, to his</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fellow drinkers, that the MMR vaccine causes autism, and a broadsheet newspaper</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">doing the same thing. Media institutions can shape public opinion, they can entrench,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or change, public opinion in a way that individual speakers cannot.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The existence of a press with such significant power is a potent antidote to the dominance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">big business and government; but it also has potential to do great harm if not exercised with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibility:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;If someone in a position of moral or political authority makes a statement about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">race or about gender, it isn&#8217;t simply that there will be a wider audience for that but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">also that the opinion comes with a greater degree of &#8211; with an imprimatur, or seems</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to, and that itself is problematic. That&#8217;s why positions of responsibility in society are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">very difficult, because you have to take a lot of care about what you say because</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people pay attention to it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The press has the power to cultivate stereotypes, not just as a matter of the megaphone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effect, but by cumulative effect also:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;there is an asymmetry between the individual case and the case of the press. One</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the reasons we tolerate the fairly broad-ranging right of individual expression is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that individuals&#8217; remarks are typically limited in their impact&#8230; But &#8230;this megaphone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">effect is a kind of culture-shaping effect &#8230; It exerts much greater influence and power</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on people, how they&#8217;re perceived by others, creating stereotypes or creating certain</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">assumptions in society.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It means that publications in the press are peculiarly vulnerable to promoting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">stereotypes, because it&#8217;s &#8211; what&#8217;s heard is widely heard. If it&#8217;s assumed that a member</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of a group is portrayed as a typical member of that group, then attitudes at large</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">towards the group will be affected.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>

<a name="section3"></a>
<h2>3. Communication: truth, comment and &#8216;assessability&#8217;</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The role of a free press as an agency of free communication (rather than of self-expression),</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of constituting a public forum of views and ideas, is an important one to focus on. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">term &#8216;media&#8217; implies both a conduit or market-place role (the means by which material is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">communicated) and also the freedoms of the press to comment, in a partisan way, on the</span>







<span style="font-size: 15px;">material that they publish (the message is editorially &#8216;mediated&#8217;). The vocal power and reach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press, and its freedoms to mediate, are what make it a mighty force.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A free press performs its communication role in a democracy in a myriad ways, day in and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">day out. It is by no means only through political journalism and holding authority to account</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the press proves its value in this way (although those are very important aspects in their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">own right). All forms of journalistic content potentially perform this vital role. Debate and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">comment, information and speculation, news and opinion, education and entertainment,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all play their part. It is exactly this multifunctional and multifaceted package of content,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">produced with such verve and to deadline week in, week out, which makes the press such a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">marvel, such a matter of pride.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The different functions of the press, though, have different implications. We care about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them in different ways and for different reasons. We apply different standards to them. So,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for example, we might say we wanted the TV listings and football results to be &#8216;accurate&#8217;;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the editorial to be &#8216;opinionated&#8217; (perhaps to confirm or challenge, or help us form, our own</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opinions); the sports reporting to be &#8216;lively&#8217; (and reasonably fair), the travel writing to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inspiring but not misleading, the crossword to be challenging but not impossible, and so on.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">And above all, we want it all to be accessible and a good read, as we all think of that in our</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different ways. This communication function is, in other words, an extremely complex and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sophisticated exchange between editor and reader.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nowhere is that more the case than in the role of the media in conveying news. It is here</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that both the demands and expectations of readers are particularly complex. We know that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some news is more important than others, but we vary in our judgments about that. We</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">want to know the facts, but we also want to know how people experienced them and what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">people think about them. We want the spirit as well as the letter of events &#8211; the emotion,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the meaning, the drama, the implications. We have an instinct that different kinds of news</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be communicated in different ways (a politician&#8217;s mistake, an outbreak of disease, a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">missing child, a disappointing new film, another rape in the town), but we will not find it easy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to articulate those differences with any great precision.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">We also know about the editorial inflection, the world-view, of the newspaper we read. For</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some, if not most, that is very much part of why it is their newspaper of choice. That does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not mean we always agree with it. But we are familiar with it, and that familiarity is at some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">level part of the attraction. Newspaper readership is remarkably loyal. We want the news in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press to be true and accurate; we do not want to be misled or lied to. But we want, or are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">content for, it to be presented in a partisan way. We want a measure of balance and context,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but we also want a perspective. We want the truth, but we understand that there are many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">versions of the truth, and incompleteness in all versions. Notwithstanding the emphasis put</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by both the industry and its critics on the difference between &#8216;fact&#8217; and &#8216;comment&#8217; these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are by no means distinct and watertight categories. The very act of describing a fact is to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">comment on it. All forms of recording are selective.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">What authentic communication between editor and reader needs in these circumstances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is no more, but no less, than a measure of shared understanding of what is going on in that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">act of communication. In most cases, that is easy and obvious. There will be a common</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expectation of complete accuracy in the TV listings; mistakes will irritate and inconvenience</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">readers and ultimately drive them to look elsewhere. A newspaper urging readers to support</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a particular party in the run-up to a General Election can be expected to be more sympathetic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to that party&#8217;s outlook and objectives than another&#8217;s, and to reflect that sympathy editorially</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">elsewhere in its pages.</span>
<p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">But in some cases, it will be neither easy nor obvious for readers to orientate themselves in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to material they read in the press. Some important examples were put before the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry in the course of the evidence. They included, for example:</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) science and health reporting, where most non-specialist readers cannot easily judge for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">themselves what experts are telling us;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) consumer journalism such as property or travel reporting and restaurant reviewing,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where we might not know whether a journalist has been an objective &#8216;mystery shopper&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or whether he or she has in fact been treated to holidays or meals by the organisations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being reviewed, or owns a property in the same square as the house being praised in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the newspaper;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) &#8216;PR&#8217; journalism, in which what is effectively commercially-produced advertising material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is reproduced as editorial without mediation at all;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) the reporting of identity issues (gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disability, appearance and so on) where the fact and manner of bringing such issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into coverage has a potential to implant a relevance for them in readers which they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have not chosen.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In all these cases, that is to say the inaccessible expertise, the conflicts of interest, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subliminal, or the simply misleadingly incomplete, the reader cannot straightforwardly make</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">up his or her mind about what the newspaper is saying. Professor Baroness Onora O&#8217;Neill,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who gave the Inquiry her views as a leading expert in the field of public thinking on the role</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the media, describes the need for readers to be able to &#8216;orientate&#8217; themselves in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to what they read as &#8220;assessability&#8221;. Mostly, readers know where they stand with what the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">papers say, and can make their own minds up about it. But not always. Where they cannot do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so unaided, more is needed for the press to fulfil its proper role.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This point about the importance of authentic communication by the press, which respects</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the needs of readers to be able to make their own minds up about what they are reading, was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made to the Inquiry in a number of ways. Examples include:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Those who aim to communicate must aspire to standards which are inapplicable for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">those who aim only to express their own views.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The public interest in a free press is not confined to the public interest in a press</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that reports matters of fact accurately and observes the disciplines of truth seeking</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">needed for various sorts of inquiry. It also includes an interest in having a press</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that communicates other sorts of content &#8211; eg music and art, puzzles and stories</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; that do not make truth claims. Nevertheless, where truth claims are made, there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is a particularly strong public interest in standards of media communication that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">meet the relevant requirements for truth seeking &#8211; accuracy about evidence and its</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">limitations; distinctions between different sorts of evidence; the inclusion of necessary</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">qualifications, and many others.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Good public interest journalism enables the public to judge what is being said.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There may be cases where one has to hold back on the source of certain information,</span>


<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but good public interest journalism seeks to make the sources and the evidence as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">available to the public as is feasible, given certain other constraints.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think the default in favour of openness is actually what good journalism does. They</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">try to give the sources where they can. The difficulty about confidential sources is the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">problem that the reader has in knowing (a) was there any source at all and (b) was it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a reliable source?&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;One aspect of the public interest &#8230; is the public interest in truthfulness &#8230; Here there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are two kinds of interest. There is the direct interest that individuals have in not being</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deceived or misled . &#8230;But there is also a second indirect interest in truthfulness, an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interest in maintaining a culture of trust. If communication is believed to be untruthful</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(or inaccurate), then trust in communication may diminish.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Simply requiring accuracy or truthfulness does not preclude a free press from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">misleading, distorting, or, in some cases, from covertly serving or promoting vested</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">interests.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;News media are often intermediaries . They play the role of communicating facts</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that have been discovered, established or claimed by others. The evidence, warrant</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or other justification for such claims may be lacking, or suspect. The intermediary</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">may not be competent to assess the claim, or have access to the evidence. They may</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be willing to pass on claims made by other self-interested parties in an uncritical way.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Knowing the source of a story is relevant to how we interpret it. Audiences&#8217; reactions</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to an article on a &#8216;new wonder drug&#8217; that &#8216;combats cancer&#8217; might be less favourable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">if they knew that the copy was verbatim from a press release by the company making</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the &#8216;wonder drug&#8217;. Our response to &#8216;advertorials&#8217; may (or at least ought to be) different</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;With regard to truthfulness and other norms of communication, the arguments</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">offered here are not that this or that claim ought to be made but rather, that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">appropriate procedures and mechanisms need to be in place to ensure that what is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">said (whatever it is) is justifiable, assessable and evaluable with regard to its source.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8230; Ensuring &#8230;communicative adequacy does not determine or constrain content,</span>

<h2>4. Press ethics and the role of a code of ethics</h2>

<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press ethics, to which the Inquiry was directed by its Terms of Reference, can be understood</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at a simple level by reference to the choices available to a free press, where those choices</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may have consequences for the benefit or harm of others, whether individuals, groups or the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public as a whole. These are the choices by which newspapers and journalists can exercise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their freedoms so as to fulfil the unique and important role of the press in a democracy or</span>







<span style="font-size: 15px;">indeed to undermine it, to promote or restrict public communication and debate, to enhance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or harm civil liberties and the autonomy of individuals.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These are choices which fall to be made within the framework of the law. Compliance with</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the law (criminal, civil and regulatory) does not necessarily exhaust the ethical choices to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be made by a free press, nor does consideration of legal risk and consequence exhaust the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibilities of a press aiming at journalism in the public interest, which takes into account</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethical risks and consequences.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The choices that a responsible and ethical press will make, then, flow from precisely those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aspects of a free press which give it a unique role and privileges in a democracy, and from an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">awareness of its power to affect the public in general, and individual members of the public,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for better or worse. The following are examples.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) If a free press in a democracy has a special role in facilitating free communication and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in constituting a public forum, then an ethical press will want to comply with good</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards of communication. It will want to enable people to recognise and assess</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the material being provided. Where it provides information, that information will be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasonably intelligible and accurate.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) If a free press in a democracy has special privileges to keep its sources secret, then an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethical press will be mindful of the reasons for and effects of that privilege and will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exercise it only for those reasons, and bearing in mind those effects. It will want to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ensure that the protection of sources is used to enhance the free flow of significant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information and especially to protect those seeking to help hold power to account. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will not use it merely to constrain or control sources, nor will it abuse the privilege to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mask the weakness or absence of sources or the existence of conflicts of interest, or to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hide its own wrongdoing.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) If a free press in a democracy has a special place because of its ability to hold power</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to account, an ethical press will consider itself to have responsibilities to do just that.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It will not collude with the powerful at the expense of the public. It will challenge all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">kinds of sources of power, both public and private. It will be mindful of the power of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press itself, and seek to hold that power to account no less than other sources of power.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">And it will support others with responsibilities for holding power to account in doing so,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including in the case of the media itself.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) Further, a free and autonomous press within a democracy will be mindful of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">democratic freedoms and autonomies of others. All such freedoms and choices, after</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all, stem from the same sources of democratic authority and accountability. And all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethical systems have at their core a sense of respect for the individuality and self-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">determination of others.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup> People are the stock-in-trade of journalism. An ethical press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will therefore be especially mindful of the need to ensure that the individuals it deals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with, both as sources of information and as the content written about, are treated as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subjects and not objects, and both as subjects in their own right and as subjects in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context, with families, connections and group identities which may be affected by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">treatment of the individual.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">All of this is to re-emphasise that the freedom of the press, even the freedom of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within the limitations and accountabilities under the law, is not enough by itself to secure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the important democratic benefits for which press freedom is a prerequisite. To become an</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">authentically free press of the kind valued and privileged in a democracy, the press must also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exercise its freedoms effectively for that purpose. It must actively choose that role and live</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out its implications. That point was made to the Inquiry in many ways; examples include:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The duties or responsibilities of the press follow straightforwardly from the reasons</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we have for wanting a free press. So if one of the main reasons for wanting a free</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press is that we be fully informed as citizens, then there are responsibilities on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press to be accurate, honest, open and accountable.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Clearly though, a press which is free in the sense of not being controlled centrally,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not censored, will only be meeting a necessary condition for serving its purposes of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">informing and scrutinising. In order for the press to serve these public interests it will</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">also need to pursue its work with accuracy and rigour, to be concerned for the truth,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to seek to avoid bias or serving particular interests, to make wise judgments as to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what is worthy of public attention and what not, and perhaps to be courageous in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pursuing these goals. (And it may well also be &#8230; that in order to serve its purpose the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press needs to communicate in ways that are intelligible and assessable).&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Freedom is not licensed, and that&#8217;s the way in which all these responsibilities bear</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on how you exercise your freedom. So you have those guiding aims of the media &#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; holding people accountable and presenting information &#8211; serving those roles and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">then these constraints.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The strategy here has been to focus on the valuable ends that a free press is meant</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to serve and then to point out (a) that a free press need not secure those ends; (b)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that a free press can even stand as an obstacle to the achievement of those ends.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">This is not to argue in favour of censorship but to point out ways in which a free press</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">can fail to contribute towards the public interest, and, as such, public-interest based</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">justifications will fail to apply.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;it is important for good judgment that the press is clear not only on the nature of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">purposes it serves in a free and democratic society but on their partial contribution to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public interest as a whole and the independent significance of other components of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the public interest. &#8230; In my view the press itself at present assumes too quickly that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">freedomofthepress(andfreeexpressiontotheextentthatisrelatedtopressfreedom)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is sufficient to guarantee that the press serves its distinctive role in contributing to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the public interest. On the one hand this is problematic because press freedom is only</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a necessary condition for the press to make its distinctive contribution to the public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interest. Treating it as a sufficient condition is making the press insensitive to all the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other factors that are critical to this &#8211; accuracy and rigour, avoidance of partiality,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bias, conflict of interest, and the other factors mentioned above. All these must</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">receive appropriate attention. But this is also problematic because assuming that a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">process (a free press) will achieve a beneficial goal allows journalists and editors to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fail to address carefully the question of what exactly that distinctive purpose is, or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">how it relates to other parts of the public interest.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup></span>





<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220; While it is important to protect genuine investigative journalism into matters of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public interest &#8230; it is also important to distinguish the genuine article from purported</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigative journalism that ignores or flouts the relevant disciplines of truth seeking,</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or is not directed at any matters of public interest. Pseudo public interest journalism</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">discredits the genuine article, is not assessable by its audiences and damages the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reputation of the media.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The moral justification for a media organisation&#8217;s rights of expression and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">communication &#8230; turns on the role of media organisations&#8217; rights in constituting a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public sphere that gives appropriate status and respect to individual people, and on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the related instrumental grounds [of constraining power and enabling democratic</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deliberation and decision-making].&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The public interest is not just in a free but a diverse press, and also &#8211; given the press&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">power and its central role within the public sphere of democratic policy-making &#8211; an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">accountable press too.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The fact that the press has certain investigative powers doesn&#8217;t mean automatically</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that it has carte blanche to do whatever it wishes to find things out.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Freedom and responsibility are not incompatible notions. &#8230; Principally behind the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">notion of freedom in my account is freedom from censorship, from authorities coming</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in and telling the press what they may or may not say with respect to output, but they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">may nonetheless have a number of responsibilities they need to respect in producing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">those outputs. I think that&#8217;s very important. No, I don&#8217;t see them as inconsistent.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The point was also made more narrowly, to underline that the freedom of the press, and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">value inherent in its freedom to publish, is the beginning and not the end of the questions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the public interest:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The fact that freedom of expression is in the public interest &#8211; and it clearly is &#8211; it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">doesn&#8217;t follow that every instance of expression is in the public interest.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think a kind of slippage can happen in which this freedom of expression is seen to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be the primary public interest the public has in the press, and then that can then seem</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as liable to trump many of the other side constraints. &#8230; So, and if one&#8217;s a journalist</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and one values being allowed to write what one thinks is important, &#8230; there&#8217;s a kind</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of, as I say, a natural slippage in which this freedom of expression can be seen to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the dominating aspect of one&#8217;s code.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I set these thoughts out to underline, and indeed to risk labouring, the point that ethical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards are not inconsistent with a free press but necessary for it fully to realise the value</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of its freedom. Ethical standards and behaviour are about valuing the freedom of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for what it is, and seeking to promote all that is good about that freedom, and not just about</span>







<span style="font-size: 15px;">avoiding the shoddy and the disreputable (far less just the unlawful). A free press certainly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has choices which it can exercise in ways which undermine the premises of its freedom and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">work contrary to the public interest. An ethical press will not choose to exercise its freedoms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in that way.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">With freedom, rights and privilege therefore come choices, and with choices, responsibilities</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as to how they are exercised and with what consequences. With choices which affect the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public sphere, come also public accountabilities.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-8"><a href="#para4-8" name="para4-8">4.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The private interests of the press industry, or of organisations within it, can be expected to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be strongly aligned with the public interest for just this reason: it is what the free press in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">democracy is all about. But there will also be powerful motivations of a contrary nature to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">overcome by an ethical press. An ethical approach requires a culture of care and awareness,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but deadlines are short and time is money. A diverse and plural press will also be a highly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">competitive one, contesting among its titles for readership and reputation. And the pressures</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of public demand, real or perceived, are by no means a reliable guide to the public interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-9"><a href="#para4-9" name="para4-9">4.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This latter point is a well-worn one: the fundamental difference between the public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and what interests the public. It is nevertheless a point which it is important to stress once</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">again, if only because of the seeming indefatigability of the argument in some quarters that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whatever sells newspapers must<span style="font-style:italic"> ipso</span><span style="font-style:italic"> facto</span> be a good thing, since newspapers are a good</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thing in themselves. The argument is sometimes put more subtly: that newspapers should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">simply meet the demands and expectations they perceive their readers to have or be capable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of having in a non-judgmental way, and that the flourishing of newspapers by such means</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">directly supports their ability to fulfil the higher purposes and freedoms of the press. But</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this is simply a further restatement of the error that because it is good for the press both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to flourish and to be free to make choices, its exercise of those choices in its own perceived</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interests will itself necessarily be good. The fallacy of this line of reasoning was emphasised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Inquiry in a number of ways:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The key point here is that the fact that people have a (vicious) curiosity clearly does</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not entail a right to know those things, nor does it automatically excuse those who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">breach other norms in the service of that curiosity.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There is no ethical duty at all to provide audiences with whatever they want, even if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there are good economic reasons for doing so.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref38" href="#footnote38">38</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The &#8216;we are only providing people with what they want&#8217; may appear to have a whiff</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of nobility about it, but where people&#8217;s wants are vicious, it is little more than an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">admission of lack of moral sensitivity.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref39" href="#footnote39">39</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">First, it is not clear what the scope of the right is (right to know what ?). Second, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">very idea of a right to know is problematic. If it is a negative claim right (no one is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">permitted to stop me from knowing) then this does not entail any correlative right</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of publication or communication. But a positive right to know (others are obliged</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to ensure that I know) is not feasible: I might not believe them, even if they tell me</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the truth. Worst still, it doesn&#8217;t tell us anything at all about whom the obligation to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">inform might fall upon.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The commercial interests of the press in supplying or stimulating demands for particular</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">kinds of content are not therefore either identical to, or even necessarily aligned with, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest in a free press. More than that, in an industry with people as its stock in trade,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">and assuming an evident and growing public appetite for information about other people</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which is contrary to the public interest because of the way in which it affects the personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">autonomy or individual rights of those people, the commercial interests of the press have a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clear potential to act contrary to the public interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-11"><a href="#para4-11" name="para4-11">4.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are other respects in which the commercial interests of the press have a clear potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to tend contrary to the public interest. They include the instances discussed above in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the private interests of individual journalists, editors or proprietors may be engaged in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editorial content in ways which may not be apparent to their readership.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup> They also include</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">incentives to anti-competitive business practices and cartel behaviour, that is to say practices</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which may benefit one organisation at the expense of the diversity of the sector as a whole,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or which may seek to unite the industry against healthy competitive disciplines and external</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scrutiny capable of benefiting readers and the public as a whole.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-12"><a href="#para4-12" name="para4-12">4.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was some emphasis throughout the Inquiry on the place of ethical codes in supporting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an ethical press. I put the matter that way with care. No code of ethics can make an unethical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisation or sector an ethical one. An unethical organisation will simply find ways round</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or disregard any code it purports to apply to itself when motivated to do so. An ethical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisation, on the other hand, will be helped and guided by a code of ethics, but that will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be on the basis that the code is simply a clear encapsulation of the values and practices of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the organisation in any event.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-13"><a href="#para4-13" name="para4-13">4.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is a very fundamental issue about culture, practices and ethics, and the way they relate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to each other. Professor Christopher Megone, who has worked extensively with industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bodies (mainly in finance and engineering) on issues of workplace ethics, put the matter this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way to the Inquiry:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Of course an ethical media organisation needs to have an ethical code, one which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reflects the distinctive mission of the organisation as part of the press (and thus is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">aware of the key role of the press regarding the public interest), and one which is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sensitive to the particular ethical challenges that may arise for editors, journalists,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">etc in pursuit of their mission.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;However, even more critical to the existence of an ethical media organisation is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">culture. &#8230; If there is an unhealthy culture then an organisation can have an ethical</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">code but it will have little influence. Members of the organisation can undergo &#8216;ethics</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">training&#8217; but it will have little effect. As soon as they return from the training to their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">desk or office, the pervasive culture will dominate their decision-making. The culture</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">brings to bear all sorts of &#8216;accepted norms&#8217; which an afternoon&#8217;s training will be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relatively powerless to affect. (I do not, of course, think that good &#8216;ethics training&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is pointless, but simply that its effectiveness depends on whether, or to what extent,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other factors are in place in the organisation.) &#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; there are a number of critical factors that could be expected to bear on ethical</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">culture in a media organisation. First, tone from the top &#8211; leadership &#8211; is of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">tremendous importance. The role of owners and editors here will be crucial. Certainly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the organisation needs to have its ethical code, but that code needs to be fully</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">understood and endorsed by its owners and editors, and these people need to live</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">out that code day in and day out. This is a decisive factor in that code having meaning</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for all who work in the organisation. But their living it out means thinking about how</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they can convey the code through their practice right across the organisation, how</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they interact with employees right across the organisation in a way that makes it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">resonant for them. &#8230;</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Secondly, an ethical organisation needs to have an open and honest culture in which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it is possible for members of the organisation to raise their concerns about practices</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and to discuss them with colleagues and senior staff. &#8230; [S]taff need to feel confident</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that if they perceive unsatisfactory practices to be developing, or face a challenging</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">situation, they can raise the matter with colleagues or senior staff. And they need</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to be confident that they can do so, and have a proper discussion, without fear of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mockery or retribution. &#8216;Accepted norms&#8217; need to be open to challenge. &#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Amongst other things, developing an open culture in a press/media organisation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">will require sensitivity to the particular kinds of pressure that journalists and other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">employees are bound to be under.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-14"><a href="#para4-14" name="para4-14">4.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Against this background, an operative code of ethics therefore would have a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potential functions.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) It would serve as a reminder of the special importance and roles, the freedoms and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privileges, the power and responsibilities of the press. It would, in other words, provide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a full context for the choices which fall to be made in practice so that they can be made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in accordance with the principles to be derived from this context. It would, in short,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explain what ethical (or, as it is sometimes described, &#8216;public interest&#8217;) journalism is.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) It would help journalists to understand the circumstances in which they are called upon</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to make ethical decisions. It would help them to make the right choices in practice. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would do this not as a matter of rigid and disconnected prescriptions and prohibitions,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but by promoting &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> stable</span><span style="font-style:italic"> disposition</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> act</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> certain</span><span style="font-style:italic"> ways</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> right</span><span style="font-style:italic"> reasons</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) It would recognise and explain the circumstances in which the temptations and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">motivations to act unethically (including commercial motivations) may be especially</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strong, and why they need to be resisted, in order to change the incentive structure in</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">such cases.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) It would seek to provide clarity, and would focus on practical applicability to everyday</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision-making.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) It would not expect to stand alone. It would take its place in a context of ethical culture,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sources of advice and guidance both generally and at the particular levels of training,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reinforcement, management and feedback.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(f) It would be authoritative and respected. It would have consequences in terms of how</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals and organisations are perceived, in terms of rewards and sanctions.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-15"><a href="#para4-15" name="para4-15">4.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry asked a number of its witnesses specifically, and through its website the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more generally, what would be the distinguishing features of the culture and practices of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media industry, or any organisation which was a part of that industry, which would make it a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognisably &#8216;ethical&#8217; one. I was particularly interested to hear in response about Professor</span>


<span style="font-size: 14px;">Baroness O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s suggested &#8216;six principles of openness&#8217;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup> for identifying ethical journalism</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which seem to me to have much to recommend them:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) openness about payments from others</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) openness about payments to others</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) openness about the interests (financial or otherwise) of owners, editors, programme-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">makers and journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) openness about errors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) openness about (most) sources, with an adequately drawn test of the public interest to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allow sources to be kept secret, for specific reasons and in particular situations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(f) openness about comments from members of the public.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-16"><a href="#para4-16" name="para4-16">4.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is also worth setting out extracts from some of the answers to this question which appear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to me to be particularly illuminative.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I do not mean a media industry driven by ethical goals in the way that a charity like</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Oxfam is. I mean, rather, a media industry whose members and whose regulatory</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">framework, while driven by a range of diverse goals that are not necessarily &#8216;ethical&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in a narrow sense, are nonetheless deeply sensitive to the industry&#8217;s pivotal role in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the liberal public sphere &#8230; A free press within an ethical media industry in this sense</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would have the following features, among others:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; a sense of journalism as a profession with its own aims and values, including</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">respect for the truth, respect for those about whom the press writes, respect</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for readers;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; poor practices (unethical, illegal, or contrary to the reasons supporting press</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">freedom) are regarded as shameful and their practitioners are ashamed of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">them;- whistle-blowers are supported;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; journalists, editors and proprietors grasp the complexity of the moral role of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the press (as, perhaps, politicians since the expenses scandal grasp the moral</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">complexity of their own role);</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; the wider public is willing to pay the comparatively high costs (e.g. of ethical</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigative methods) to support a press that upholds a liberal public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sphere.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup> &#8221; In my view media organisations are ethical if they genuinely try to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">communicate in ways that enable intended audiences to understand and to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">assess what they publish, while respecting the legitimate claims of those on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whom they comment and of those affected by their reporting.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">These are demanding aims. To meet them the media need not only to refrain from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">unlawful speech acts (threatening, bribing, defaming, breaches of data protection,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">breaches of confidentiality &#8211; and many others) but to meet adequate ethical and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">epistemic standards in journalistic, editorial and business practice.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">failings which those in the media fall into.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2. Such a code needs to be presented in the context of the specific critical</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contribution that a free press can make to the public interest...</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">3. The code could then be developed in terms of the duties to the key parties with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whom the press/media interact in ethically relevant ways.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">4. A code by itself is not worth the paper it is written on unless it is a lived code.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">To make a code a lived code, media organisations need to attend to the critical</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">factors that can bring about an ethical organisation, or promote integrity in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an organisation. These factors include tone from the top (or leadership), an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">open and honest culture, and so on. &#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">5. Part of developing such an ethically reflective organisation might be to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">introduce governance reports which press/media would produce annually,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">writing such reports in light of the requirements of the code. The reports might</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reflect both on the ethical culture of the organisation and on the organisation&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contribution to the public interest. Any such governance reporting would need</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to avoid either being overburdensome or being a mere ritual in order to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">both effective and meaningful&#8230;&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In order for a code of conduct to be properly effective it has to be, not only coherent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and justified in terms of its normative content, but such that there is something</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about the social, institutional, legal or practical context that motivates and secures</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">I conclude this analysis by recognising the risks that this Inquiry must confront. The Editor-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in-Chief of the Mail titles, Paul Dacre, identified these risks, and the challenges the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">faces, in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...I would argue that Britain&#8217;s commercially viable free press, because it&#8217;s in hock to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nobody, is the only real free media in this country. Over-regulate that press, and you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">put democracy itself in peril.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have always been keenly aware of the dangers of going too far; and I have been continually</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reminded as the Inquiry has progressed. In short, it has not been difficult for me to remain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">alive to this critical risk. I go further. The public interest in a press which is free, which is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">viable, and which is diverse cannot be too highly valued. Without investigative journalism,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the ability of the press to scour hidden places, the domain of the powerful, for potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wrongdoing, our democracy would be severely impoverished. Nothing I shall recommend will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fail to hold to these principles.</span>
