<h1>CHAPTER 1<br/>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This Part of the Report alludes to some of the fundamental principles which must provide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the context for any consideration of the role of the press in the United Kingdom. It does so</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principally for the purpose of brief overview and explanation, and to set the scene for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">narrative, analysis and recommendations which follow.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The principles which are set out are not simply derived from philosophical or jurisprudential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">writings. Proprietors, editors and journalists wrote and spoke about the importance of what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they do for all of us in the UK, and the value it has for our common life. Politicians described</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the principles informing their own relationship with the media, including as policy-makers.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commentators suggested the matters that the Inquiry should bear particularly in mind in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approaching its task. This brief overview seeks to distil, without necessarily fully rehearsing,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the essence of the points of principle which were put before the Inquiry.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Without seeking, or needing, to do full justice to the fine nuances of opinion which it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">possible to hold and debate about such matters, this Part of the Report aims simply to set out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a framework of understanding which is relatively uncontroversial. It is therefore the intention</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">simply to underline, to put beyond doubt, the extent to which the Inquiry has itself proceeded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the basis of the perspectives set out, and to do so in terms with which I believe that most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the public would be able broadly to agree.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is also the intention of this Part of the Report to clarify some of the strands of thought which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been woven through a great deal of the evidence the Inquiry has received. Concepts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such as the freedom of the press, freedom of expression and the public interest have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">much referred to in the course of the evidence. These are potent expressions, and powerful</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and important concepts; commensurate clarity and care is needed in their deployment in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context of a Report on the culture, practices and ethics of the press. They are concepts which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are capable of being, and have been, used both rhetorically and analytically to explain and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">support a range of different perspectives, arguments and conclusions.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Attempting an all-embracing definition of concepts of this sort, even within the limitations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Inquiry&#8217;s Terms of Reference, is neither necessary nor appropriate. Some measure of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clarification is nevertheless attempted, both to underline the importance of these concepts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and also to indicate the traps they can sometimes set for the unwary. This is not intended to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">make any claims to an especial authority in doing so, but only to give some indication of why</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they are important, and the limits of the uses and justifications to which they can be put.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These are precious and fundamental principles, to which great respect must be paid; at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">same time, they must be handled thoughtfully and with care.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry was considerably assisted in this respect not only by the way that the issue has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been put by so many journalists but, in particular by the expert witness evidence it received,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in both written and oral form.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> I recognise that I have freely borrowed from their observations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in some of what follows and I am grateful to them. In doing so and while acknowledging this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">debt, I should make clear, that the analysis set out here is entirely that of the Inquiry and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is not to be taken to be representative of the entirety of the views of the expert witnesses,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">collectively or individually. As with other aspects of the evidence that I have sought to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">summarise, I can only commend those interested to the original evidence: any summary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cannot attempt to do full justice to it.</span>
