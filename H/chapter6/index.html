<h1>CHAPTER 6<br/>THE RELATIONSHIP: THE ICO AND THE PRESS</h1>

<h2>1. &#8220;too big for us?&#8221;</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This section of the Report takes its title from the passage in Mr Owens&#8217; evidence where he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">describes an exchange in a meeting he says took place with Mr Thomas and Mr Aldhouse in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which he sought to explain the full extent of the Motorman &#8216;treasure trove&#8217;. Mr Owens said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, it was at the end, I basically said what we have here, if we haven&#8217;t got any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public defence we can go for everybody, from the blagger right up to the newspaper,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at which point there was a look of horror on Mr Aldhouse&#8217;s face and he said, &#8220;We</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">can&#8217;t take them on, they&#8217;re too big for us&#8221;, and Mr Thomas just sort of bemused, deep</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in thought, just said, &#8220;Fine, thanks very much, Alex, pass my compliments on and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">congratulations to the team for me, job well done.&#8221; And that was basically it.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both Mr Thomas and Mr Aldhouse have said that they had no recollection of the meeting and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disclaimed the language attributed to them by Mr Owens in any event.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Owens, however, amplified in his evidence that he had formed the clear impression that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was, if not an express instruction or even express language, a cultural understanding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within the ICO that the press were too big for the office to take on:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The decision not to pursue any journalist was based solely on fear &#8211; fear of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">power, wealth and influence of the Press and the fear of the backlash that could</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">follow if the press turned against ICO.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas specifically challenged Mr Owens&#8217; reliability as a witness in this context, even</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggesting that he may have had a motive, in the light of<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> number</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> performance,</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">disciplinary and grievance issues between Mr Owens and the ICO&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> ,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> put</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> latter</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span><span style="font-style:normal"> poor</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">light<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> this is an inference that Mr Owens, in turn, resisted.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas and Mr Aldhouse were also emphatic that there was not at any time in the ICO a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deliberate or explicit policy of holding back from taking action in respect of the press, or from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">engaging directly with the press, whether from fear or otherwise. As we have seen, a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of operational rationales have been given in explanation of the &#8216;roads not taken&#8217;.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not appropriate now for me to seek to resolve the evident dispute between Mr Owens</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the ICO and, in particular, it is not necessary to determine whether the conversation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as recounted by Mr Owens took place or not. It is not even necessary for me to determine</span>

<a name="page1097"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">whether there was a deliberate, explicit or promulgated policy in the ICO of not &#8216;taking on&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press which was operative during the course of the Motorman decision-making. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question addressed in this part of the Report relates to something more fundamental, and at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the same time less easy to pinpoint, which is the extent to which there may have underlying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assumptions in the culture of the ICO and its leadership which instinctively held them back</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from an engagement with the press which their knowledge of the extent of the problem, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an objective assessment of their available powers, functions and options, might otherwise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have suggested. Regardless of whether the words were ever uttered, it is legitimate to ask</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether &#8216;the press are too big for us&#8217; did, in fact, accurately identify some reluctance, or lack</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of confidence, in dealing with the press which goes some way to explaining events.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">With the single (and, in the event, salutary) exception discussed below, the ICO does not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appear ever seriously to have tested its regulatory powers in relation to the press. Successive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Information Commissioners have taken the view that the law must be understood to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discourage them from doing so. Although it is clear that there are features of the current</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">data protection regime which seem to make it unnecessarily difficult for the ICO to apply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the law to the press, the conclusion that the press is not the business of the ICO is not one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for which any authority in law can, in the end, be claimed. Moreover successive Information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioners have never sought to draw attention to problems in applying the current law</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the press. If there was a case for political campaigning for changes to the law, it is legitimate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to ask why it was not addressed to the impediments to mainstream civil law enforcement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rather than the relatively more peripheral issue of criminal penalties.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Even more notable has been the reluctance of the ICO to engage informally with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry (otherwise than by way of the PCC or other intermediary bodies), whether as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matter of law enforcement, of promoting good practice or simply of business education and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">communication. Successive Information Commissioners assured the Inquiry that the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was simply not a priority for the ICO&#8217;s attention. And yet Operation Motorman was one of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the biggest operational cases to confront the ICO and the basis for two reports to Parliament</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and years of campaigning with the PCC and successive Governments. This was a case with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">culture, practices and ethics of the press at its heart. Furthermore, the current press issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relating to phone hacking have created one of the biggest crises of confidence in the integrity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of private information to have been experienced in the UK.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the face of it, this phenomenon is not straightforward to understand. The question before</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry was whether there is evidence of a failure of regulatory will on the part of the ICO</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to the press, going beyond the specifics of the Motorman case, and the technical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">imperfections of the legal regime, to a more general reluctance to discharge its functions in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this area.</span>

<h3>The ICO and The Sunday Times</h3>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In considering this question, it is interesting to turn first to a series of events which predate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">many of the key developments in the Motorman case. It was put to Mr Thomas in oral</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence that the ICO had invited the editor of The Sunday Times, Mr Witherow, to attend</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interview under caution in 2003 in respect of possible breaches of s55 of the DPA in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the tax affairs of Lord Levy. Mr Thomas said he had no knowledge of this whatever, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">having been put on notice of the question earlier he had checked with Mr Aldhouse, with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whom the account &#8216;rang a faint bell&#8217;. Mr Thomas offered this thought:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref5" name="footnote5" title="Go back to footnote reference 5 in the text">5</a>.  p66, lines 5-9, Richard Thomas, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-9-December-2011.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1098"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;If that had been the case &#8211; and can I speculate? If the Office had invited the editor and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had been rebuffed, that might perhaps have influenced people at the investigatory</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">level as to the problems of interviewing people from the press. I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He suggested that it might have been before his time.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-10"><a href="#para1-10" name="para1-10">1.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The history appears to have been that The Sunday Times had published an article in 2000</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the tax affairs of Lord Levy which the latter had sought to prevent by means of an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">application for an injunction which had come before the then Mr Justice Toulson. According</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Mr Witherow,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> that attempt failed<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;because</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> judge</span><span style="font-style:italic"> decided</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> publication</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the information was firmly in the public interest&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> ;</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Witherow</span><span style="font-style:normal"> described</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Thomas</span><span style="font-style:normal"> as</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subsequently seeking to interview him under caution about the Lord Levy story but<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;again</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this was rebuffed because of our public interest defence&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> ,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> support</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> which</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> judgment</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Toulson J was deployed. Mr Witherow thought the ICO had accepted that.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> Eventually, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sunday Times ran a front page story on 29 October 2006 connecting Lord Levy with a &#8216;cash</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">for honours&#8217; scandal.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-11"><a href="#para1-11" name="para1-11">1.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The matter was explored further with Mr Thomas by Mr Rhodri Davies QC on behalf of News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">International.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> Mr Thomas had taken up his post in November 2002 and it was in fact on 11</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">December 2002 that the ICO wrote to Mr Witherow inviting him to attend an interview under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">caution. The signatory of the letter was an investigator in the ICO junior to Alex Owens. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposition which, in effect, Mr Davies put to Mr Thomas was that the attempt to interview</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Witherow was the direct result of powerful and well-connected pressure being applied</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the ICO by Lord Levy rather than any independent operational consideration, and was in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effect misconceived in the first place because it was plain that nothing other than investigative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalism in the public interest was in issue. Whether or not that was the case is not to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the purpose of this Inquiry, although Mr Thomas accepted that Lord Levy had, around the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant time,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;expressed</span><span style="font-style:italic"> quite</span><span style="font-style:italic"> strong</span><span style="font-style:italic"> frustration</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> my</span><span style="font-style:italic"> office</span><span style="font-style:italic"> had</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> been</span><span style="font-style:italic"> much</span><span style="font-style:italic"> use</span><span style="font-style:italic"> at</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sorting out his complaints&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> this</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> not</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> first</span><span style="font-style:normal"> time</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> office</span><span style="font-style:normal"> had</span><span style="font-style:normal"> been</span><span style="font-style:normal"> subject</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">high profile criticism from a public figure who had gone to them with a problem.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-12"><a href="#para1-12" name="para1-12">1.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This episode is of interest to the Inquiry not because of any light it may shed on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">susceptibility of the ICO to operational pressure from high profile complainants, but because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it stands out as the only occasion on which, so far as we have been able to establish, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO attempted to exert its functions directly in relation to the press. Mr Davies put it to Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thomas that this was, in fact, the only occasion upon which<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> big</span><span style="font-style:italic"> stick</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> an</span><span style="font-style:italic"> interview</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">under caution was wielded&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> by</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> ICO</span><span style="font-style:normal"> against</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> press;</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Thomas</span><span style="font-style:normal"> confirmed</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not aware of any other example in which the ICO<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;directly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> approached</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> journalist</span><span style="font-style:italic"> or</span><span style="font-style:italic"> editor&#8221;</span> .</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Moreover, Mr Thomas sought to distance himself from the Witherow decision; he suggested</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it was taken at a junior level and that it did not look entirely defensible. The contrast with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the absence of any approach to a journalist or editor in the Motorman case was made by Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Davies for a different purpose from that of the Inquiry, but is nevertheless memorable.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-13"><a href="#para1-13" name="para1-13">1.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The issue of the impact on the ICO of its rebuff at the hands of the Mr Witherow is not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unimportant. The episode evidently remained in the memory of The Sunday Times, and it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interesting to note that the one or two subsequent occasions on which that title and the ICO</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had occasion to interact had a distinctively adversarial quality.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first concerns the editorial published in The Sunday Times on 29 October 2006 which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is the day the paper led on its front page with the Lord Levy &#8216;cash for honours&#8217; story. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thrust of the editorial was in opposition to the campaign by Mr Thomas for an increase to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the maximum penalty for breach of s55 of the DPA; it cast the proposition as offensive to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">democracy and free speech and it was not sparing in the aspersions cast on Mr Thomas&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intentions in this respect. A couple of brief excerpts will give a flavour:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;the role of the press in protecting the public by exposing the abuses of the powerful.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Newspapers had already been doing this for centuries when he took up his post four</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">years ago. This duty of the media is vital in the struggle to maintain an open society.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Yet Mr Thomas would send reporters to prison for fulfilling it.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Mr Thomas is complicit in placing another brick in the wall that the state is building</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to protect itself from unwanted scrutiny. This newspaper&#8217;s front page story today</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on cash for honours is precisely the sort of investigation that political parties would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">prefer not to happen. Mr Thomas is doing his bit to help them.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The editorial also alluded to<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy?</span> as a &#8216;little noticed report&#8217;. Mr Thomas</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wrote to the paper a couple of days later in response, but his letter does not appear to have</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas characterised this editorial as an unfair representation of his campaign, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accordingly as a recognisable part of the concerted press campaign to oppose it.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> More</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">controversially, he said that he made a connection in his mind between the editorial and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the meeting he had had with Les Hinton and others on the previous Friday as part of his PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">campaign, at which of course the difference of views on the s55 issue had played a prominent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">part. When he aired this thought in the Inquiry, it was subjected both to detailed rebuttal and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to further challenge of his attitude to the press more generally. Mr Witherow made explicit the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">belief of The Sunday Times that, because the ICO had sought to interview him under caution</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in 2002, it was a matter of concern that Mr Thomas would not have adequately considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues of the public interest in investigative journalism in running his s55 campaign.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup> Further,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Davies, on behalf of News International, put it to Mr Thomas that it was relevant that, on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the intervening Saturday, The Times had published an interview with Mr Thomas that he had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given a few weeks previously in an effort to obtain some press coverage for an international</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">data protection conference in London the following week.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-16"><a href="#para1-16" name="para1-16">1.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas accepted the evidence that there was no connection between the meeting with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hinton and the editorial, concluding:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;It</span><span style="font-style:italic"> appears</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I&#8217;m</span><span style="font-style:italic"> even</span><span style="font-style:italic"> wrong</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> raise</span><span style="font-style:italic"> questions&#8230;&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">But it appears significant that, in rebutting the idea of a connection between the editorial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and a meeting two days earlier, NI chose instead to make a connection between the editorial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the ICO attempt to interview the editor of the newspaper four years earlier. Whatever</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas and the ICO had learned from that attempt, the impact on The Sunday Times</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was manifest.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication in that report of further details of the Motorman information, particularly as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it related to The Sunday Times. The tone of the letter can be described as confrontational;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it alleges that the report was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;clearly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> defamatory&#8221;</span> of the publishers and managing editor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(Mr Caseby himself), raises a number of points about the Motorman evidence and, before</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concluding with a request for an explanation and remedial steps as soon as possible, states</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the writer did<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> believe</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> your</span><span style="font-style:italic"> conduct</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> this</span><span style="font-style:italic"> matter</span><span style="font-style:italic"> can</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> described</span><span style="font-style:italic"> as</span><span style="font-style:italic"> fair,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> or</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that it meets the standards which one should be entitled to expect from a regulator&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span></span>

<p id="para-id-1-18"><a href="#para1-18" name="para1-18">1.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas&#8217; response of 2 February 2007<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup> was a measured explanation of why the ICO had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been entitled, or to an extent required, by virtue of its role and functions to deal as it had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the information published in<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Now?</span> but indicated that, on revisiting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the figures connected with The Sunday Times, it had discovered an error in the report. Rather</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than identifying the title with 52 alleged transactions involving 7 journalists, it should have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identified it with only 4 transactions and a single journalist. For this the letter offered an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unqualified apology, and Mr Thomas explained that the error was corrected in letters to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Parliament and to all the recipients of the report.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-19"><a href="#para1-19" name="para1-19">1.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This account of interactions between the ICO and The Sunday Times is set out in detail here</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because it brings into focus the following issues:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) It raises again the question of distance between the senior leadership of the ICO</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and operational decision-making with very high profile and long lasting strategic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consequences. Mr Thomas was apparently not involved in and had no foreknowledge</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the decision to try to interview Mr Witherow, and accepted that the way the decision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was taken was unsatisfactory. There were lessons to be learned in this about the vital</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">need for the senior leadership to be sighted on and involved in major operational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decisions of this reputational nature.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) It illustrates with some clarity what might be described as the ideological opposition of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press to the assertion of law enforcement powers, even in criminal matters, and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lack of objectivity and restraint with which that resistance is manifested; this is a matter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered extensively elsewhere in this Report.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) On the other hand, it also illustrates the dangers to the operational credibility of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator such as the ICO in investing so heavily, prominently and persistently in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political campaign to which a regulated sector was obviously deeply antagonistic.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) It can hardly be doubted that the reverberations of these adversarial encounters (many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of which were played out in public) would have been felt personally by Mr Thomas and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the staff of the ICO. Whether or not Mr Thomas and Mr Aldhouse felt or articulated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the view that the press was &#8216;too big for us&#8217;, I consider it almost inevitable that Mr Owens</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and his small team (to whom operational decision-making was effectively consigned)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">learned that lesson from the experience of trying to utilise their powers on the press in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the form of the editor of The Sunday Times.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-20"><a href="#para1-20" name="para1-20">1.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">With that significant narrative thread in mind, it falls to consider what can be known or can be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deduced about the thinking of the ICO more generally in relation to the press. Mr Aldhouse</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">denied being party to any<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;timorous</span><span style="font-style:italic"> approach&#8221;</span> to the press<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup> ; as well as disclaiming the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attitude that &#8216;the press are too big to take on&#8217; he cited his experience of discussions in 1996</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which was the run up to the passage of the 1998 Act. He said that:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;we were quite happy to stand up to the media and try to negotiate with them. I wish</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I still had the copies of the press gazette articles roundly attacking Elizabeth France</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">[the then Data Protection Registrar - the ICO predecessor body] and myself. So I don&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fear the media&#8230;&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It might be observed, however, that these experiences were evidently not on the operational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">side of the business, and that, in any event, Mr Aldhouse evidently considered his role to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at some distance from the operational decisions where fear of the press might have played</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a material role.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-21"><a href="#para1-21" name="para1-21">1.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry pursued explicitly with Mr Thomas himself the question of whether the power or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">influence of the press, or his perception of it, in any way affected the operational decisions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken in the Motorman case. He said that it did not, nor did he have any fear himself of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup> As we have seen, both Mr Thomas and Mr Aldhouse rejected any suggestion that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there had been a deliberate, explicit or promulgated policy of holding back from taking any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proactive operational measures in respect of evidence of press contravention of the legal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requirements of the data protection regime or in respect of promoting good practice in data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protection matters within the industry. Again, it is not the concern of this Part of the Report</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to establish the existence or otherwise of a formal policy, but to explore the nature of any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significant cultural or psychological predispositions within the ICO and its leadership not to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assert itself with the press or at least not to do so in an adversarial or confrontational way.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-22"><a href="#para1-22" name="para1-22">1.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Standing back to consider the explanations for the various paths not taken by the office</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the Motorman case, the following reflections presented themselves. The explanation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for targeting the &#8216;middlemen&#8217; (that is to say, the investigation agencies) rather than the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commissioning journalists proceeded by reference to an analogy with drug dealers which</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">I consider misconceived.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup> This was not a market in which the private investigators were a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dominant power, controlling supplies of standard goods and pushing them on a disadvantaged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clientele. It was a market in which the press were the dominant power, commissioning</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bespoke products from what must be assumed to be a limited number of investigators willing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to obtain them at some risk to themselves.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-23"><a href="#para1-23" name="para1-23">1.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Indeed, Mr Thomas himself, in explaining the stance taken in<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy?</span> , stated that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was the journalists who were driving this market.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup> He said the same thing in explaining his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">policy decision to proceed by engagement with the PCC: the focus there also was on stopping</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the market.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup> Accordingly, it is difficult to accept at face value the logic of concentrating</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;These offences occur because there is a market for this kind of information. At a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">time when senior members of the press were publicly congratulating themselves</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for having raised journalistic standards across the industry, many newspapers were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">continuing to subscribe to an undercover economy devoted to obtaining a wealth</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of personal information forbidden to them by law. One remarkable fact is how well</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">documented this underworld turned out to be.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-24"><a href="#para1-24" name="para1-24">1.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At least one operative reason why the ICO took no direct enforcement action against any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalist, editor or proprietor in response to Motorman (and, in particular, no prosecution</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">action) was evident apprehension about the likely response of the press to any attempt to do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so. Mr Thomas told the Inquiry that, in planning to wait and see how criminal proceedings</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">against the investigators and public officials fared before actively considering any further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforcement action:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I was also conscious that any action against journalists would be a major logistical,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">evidential and legal challenge, would almost certainly be strongly resisted and would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be very expensive for an Office with very limited resources.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-25"><a href="#para1-25" name="para1-25">1.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidential and legal challenges in the way of prosecution (which including the protection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">afforded to journalistic materials and sources) may have been significant, but the prospects</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of facing combative defence litigation appeared to be a disincentive in its own right. Counsel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">instructed by the CPS in Operation Glade was reported to have described the experience of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dealing with press defendants in these memorable terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;London counsel indicated that the journalists were interviewed and were found to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be tricky, well armed and well briefed, effectively a barrel of monkeys.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-26"><a href="#para1-26" name="para1-26">1.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Pressed as to whether this suggested an excessively circumspect approach on the part of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO in the face of potentially powerful prima facie evidence of criminality, Mr Thomas put it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, I have to look at it from all points of view, I suppose, but I can see that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">media would not like any of their journalists being prosecuted and I suspect they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would, for example, argue there&#8217;s a public interest in being able to ensure freedom</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of expression. Now, I don&#8217;t believe that, I don&#8217;t accept that, but I &#8211; it&#8217;s one thing as to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whether or not that would be successful, but one can anticipate that that sort of point</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would have been raised and it would have engaged the office and bogged down the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">office for many years.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-27"><a href="#para1-27" name="para1-27">1.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In other words, there was an apprehension of the<span style="font-style:italic"> unreasonable</span><span style="font-style:italic"> or</span><span style="font-style:italic"> unfair</span> deployment of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">not least because it was evidently a general perception within the ICO team. Mr Thomas</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recalled a conversation within the office around 2007 along the lines:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Thank God we didn&#8217;t take the journalists to court. They&#8217;d have gone all the way to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Strasbourg.&#8221; In other words, they would have challenged any action we would have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">taken, we would have gone right to Strasbourg, the Court of Human Rights, Article</span>

<p id="para-id-1-28"><a href="#para1-28" name="para1-28">1.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was a gut instinct that litigation against the press would present the ICO with enormous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">difficulties.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup> These were evidently perceived to be difficulties over and above the normal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">litigation issues of accessing and deploying evidence, navigating the law, and the overall</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strengths and weaknesses of the case. It can be reasonably inferred from the evidence that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the perception extended to:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) the likelihood of a generally aggressive stance;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) the generalised deployment of the rhetoric of freedom of expression beyond the fair</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">articulation of balance contained in the law; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) the expectation that that approach would extend beyond the confines of any single case</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of criminal litigation, and even beyond the bounds of any single attempt at regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">action of whatever nature, to a generalised stance of hostility towards the function of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ICO as a regulator.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence the Inquiry considered<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup> suggests that this apprehension was almost certainly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justified on the basis that the press have a cultural inclination to be defensive and to utilise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attack as the best form of defence. It was plainly operative.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-29"><a href="#para1-29" name="para1-29">1.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The press, in other words, as an object of regulatory contemplation, was seen as trouble.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That is so whether it was actively making operational mischief in response to regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attention or impassively declining to address its culture, practices and ethics itself (as Mr</span>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At the beginning of this section of the Report, reference is made to the problematic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reputation of the data protection regime. This is a burden with which successive Information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioners and their predecessor bodies have struggled constantly. Trying to get the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues surrounding data protection to be better known and understood is a vital precursor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to improving compliance and standards. Communication and profile are in turn vital</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">components of raising awareness. The ICO needs publicity for its functions. To a degree, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">needs the press, and therefore has a motivation or predisposition to court it, or at least to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view it as a potentially ally. To what may be a significantly greater degree, it is also vulnerable</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Raising the profile of data protection is an important part of the remit of the office and of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the personal remit of its figurehead Commissioner. Both Mr Thomas and Mr Graham have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clearly and commendably shown real commitment to, and significant leadership and personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investment in, that very challenging remit. Mr Thomas put it in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;When I started, data protection had quite a poor reputation. It was seen as a bit</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nerdy, not taken very seriously across many organisations. I think my office probably</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had some responsibility. I used to say that, you know, we were seen outside as the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">temple of data protection and being the high priests of data protection, and I wanted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to destroy that sort of approach, and therefore I was trying to make us much less</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">esoteric, much more avoiding the technical language. I mean, a data subject is a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">man, a woman, a child, not a data subject. So I took a much more practical down to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">earth approach. Our slogan was that we are here to help organisations who want</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to get it right, but we&#8217;ll be tough on those organisations which don&#8217;t want to get it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">right&#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas also explained his profile-raising function with particular reference to the wider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">role he saw for the two<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy?</span> reports:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I was personally involved in this promotional activity to a very considerable extent.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">TheCommissioner&#8211;asthepersonification and leaderof theICO - is obviously expected</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to be a visible part of all major activity. In this case, I attached particular priority to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the issue and also viewed promoting the reports as a tangible way of fulfilling a wider</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ambition to get data protection taken more seriously.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The potential power of the press as a friend of data protection however, also confronted the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO with an awareness of its potential power as an opponent. Mr Thomas was aware of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obvious risk inherent in his strategic response to Motorman by way of the publication of the</span>

<blockquote>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We were aware from the outset that the media would probably ignore or show</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hostility to our reports. This presented two problems:</span>

<ul>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;"><li> The media usually play an important and influential role in any campaign by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an independent body to secure legislative and other change. In this case we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">anticipated hostility through both editorial and proprietorial influence.</span></li>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;"><li> We had worked very hard to secure a &#8220;good press&#8221; for the ICO across a very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wide range of other DPA and FOI functions and had been largely successful.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There was a real fear that this could be jeopardised.&#8221;</span></li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That was a fear which proved to be entirely well-founded. Furthermore, if it was a fear which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was clearly present in Mr Thomas mind in relation to his strategic and political response to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Motorman, it does not seem a large step to infer that that was a fear understood</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more generally in the office, not excluding its (more junior) operational staff.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although the risk of press hostility to the objectives of the ICO was present from the outset,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is evident that the sheer scale of the risk and its potential to affect not only the outcome of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a particular political campaign but the fundamental nature of the relationship between the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press and the regulator was only a gradual revelation over the months and years. Towards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the end of his oral evidence to the Inquiry about the course of the s55 campaign, Mr Thomas</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think there was a general feeling that people at the head of newspapers were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">very influential with the politicians and this perhaps was an example of that. And</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">although they rested their case, as I said just now, on the threats to investigative</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalism, I was surprised by how hard they were fighting, and it really left me with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a message that we were challenging something which went to the heart of much of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the - certainly the tabloid press activity. Someone once said to me: &#8220;You do realise</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that you are actually challenging their whole business model?&#8221; Maybe that&#8217;s one</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reason they were fighting so hard, because on the one hand, they were not publicly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">accepting this sort of thing went on. On the other hand, they were fighting very hard</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to avoid the consequences of the law as we saw it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas mature reflections on the lessons he learned from the experience of the s55</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">campaign are worth pondering in this context:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Whatever was precisely known about the nature and extent of press misconduct</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">across the industry as a whole, it became increasingly clear that the press were able</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to assert very substantial influence on public policy and the political processes. I have,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">throughout my career, been involved in a wide range of activities where it has been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">essential to attract media attention and, better still, active media support. The ICO</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press team was very effective at giving strategic, tactical and practical advice and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">securing favourable media coverage on many occasions. But, in the matters covered</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by this Statement, the press had a direct interest and a hostile attitude which made it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">very difficult to achieve our objectives. The history of the campaign over the Criminal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Justice and Immigration Bill &#8230; left me in no doubt about the power of the press. I can</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recall saying to my colleagues in 2007 and 2008 that, with hindsight, it may have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been a mistake on our part to have highlighted press misconduct in our reports. We</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">may have made better progress if we had concentrated more on breaches of s55 by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">other sectors.&#8221;</span>

<h2>3. Independent regulation of the press: lessons learned</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the ICO did indeed consider itself disadvantaged in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the task of discharging its functions in relation to the press. That was expressed in a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of dimensions which include insufficiency of legal powers, deference to other authorities,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">competing operational priorities, practical resourcing and capability issues. Having said</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, although each of those dimensions contains important truths, they do not give a full</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">account. Despite the abundant evidence, both patent and latent, of problems in the culture,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and ethics of the press in handling personal information, the ICO has not been</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to address the matter. That is not simply a historical matter; it is perceptible in its approach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">today. In a context in which public concern about press standards and respect for the law has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reached sufficiently acute proportions to warrant the commissioning of a judicial inquiry, that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">must be seen as a regulatory failure within the Terms of Reference of the Inquiry.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is an understandable failure. The lessons to be learned from the narrative of the ICO and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press are entirely congruent with the evidence to the Inquiry of the approach of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more generally. That approach is too often characterised by:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) resistance to independent regulation of both law and standards;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) a confrontational, aggressive and personal approach to its critics;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) powerful behind the scenes political lobbying in its own interests; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) the deployment, through a very loud megaphone, of the rhetoric of the freedom of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press to stifle rational criticism and debate about where the public interest lies.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although it is a failure to which the ICO may be considered to have contributed by reason of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its own choices, for example by engaging in the political arena on contested policy matters</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to a degree beyond what was likely to be constructive and productive, and in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operational decision making, I do not attribute it wholly or mainly to the individual leadership</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the ICO. If, however, there is a perception of inequality of arms in the relationship between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ICO and the press, and if it is one which for understandable reasons the ICO has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reluctant to articulate or seek to remedy itself, then Mr Owens&#8217; rhetorical question takes on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">certain urgency for the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It&#8217;s our job to take them or indeed anyone else on, that&#8217;s what we are paid to do. If</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we do not do it then who does?&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The ICO has to be capable of performing its function in relation to the press, however balanced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and light touch the exercise of that function should be. It keeps wicket in this respect, on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behalf of the public and at public expense. It does not have an option simply to leave the field</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">open. As was observed in recent High Court proceedings, which also took a wider view of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO&#8217;s functions in relation to journalism than it was minded to take itself:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;there is a need for someone to protect the public.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The final part of this part of the Report therefore briefly identifies the structural and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">governance issues which are likely to need to be addressed to put the ICO in a position in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which it is capable of discharging its functions in relation to the press. This is at the margins</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Terms of Reference but, in the light of the analysis to which the ICO has been subject,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have no doubt that it is appropriate to identify the parameters of a solution before leaving</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the matter to the more detailed consideration both of the Ministry of Justice and the ICO</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">itself.</span>

<h2>4.  Powers, governance and capability of the ICO:  reflections for the future </h2>


<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The legal structure of the ICO is such that the entirety of the functions of the office is devolved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">through the office and the person of the Information Commissioner. The organisation of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">office (that is to say, the division of functions, decision-making processes, accountabilities,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">staff mix and so on) are matters within the personal discretion of the Commissioner.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In looking at the issues raised in this section of the Report, some issues of governance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appeared to be raised by the narrative. In particular, the importance of the connection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between the strategic leadership and the operational activities of the office, and the question</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the circumspection that the ICO evidently felt and feels about fulfilling its functions in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to the press raised questions about its organisational capability to act effectively in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this area.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The data protection regime has specific application to journalism, as indeed it does to other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sectors for which special provision is made in the law. To operate successfully in specialist</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">areas, a regulator needs to have access to two forms of specialist knowledge. This includes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legal expertise in the operation of the relevant statutory provisions, and business knowledge</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the sector concerned. In the person of Mr Graham, of course, the ICO is currently led</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by a Commissioner with direct experience in the sector, but it is essential that the relevant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expertise is also accessible at operational levels. The historic lack of direct engagement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between the ICO and the industry may not only be a symptom of the ICO&#8217;s lack of operational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">familiarity with the press, but also a cause of it. I recommend that the opportunity should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken by the ICO to review the availability of specialist legal and practical knowledge of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">application of the data protection regime to the press, and to any extent necessary address it.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A fruitful exchange of knowledge, experience and perspective between the strategic and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operational levels of a regulator such as the ICO is fundamental to the success of both. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the history of its engagement on matters relating to the press, I have some questions about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether the organisation and decision-making processes of the ICO have been such as to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">support the necessary exchange and that its success in discharging its functions has suffered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a result. I therefore recommend that the opportunity should be taken by the ICO to review</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">its organisation and decision-making processes to ensure that large-scale issues, with both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strategic and operational dimensions, such as the intersection between the culture, practices</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and ethicsofthepressin relation topersonal information on theonehand, and theapplication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the data protection regime to the press on the other, can be satisfactorily considered and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">addressed in the round.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The model of a single post holder is not one which is generally encountered in modern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory regimes, especially those whose responsibilities extend to powerful business</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sectors. There has in recent years been a fairly general trend away from individual decision-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">makers to boards. The Director-General for Fair Trading was replaced several years ago by a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chairman, Chief Executive and Board. The DG for electricity and gas regulation was replaced in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the late 1990s by the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (a board in which non-executives</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">form the majority), and subsequently the executive role was divided between Chairman and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chief Executive. With the creation of Ofcom, the DG for telecommunications was replaced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with a full board (which spanned other areas); Ofwat made the same transition in the mid-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2000s; and the health regulator, Monitor, recently moved from a combined executive role</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(with board oversight) to separate chairman/CEO roles.</span>
<a name="page1108"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are a number of reasons why the single model has drawbacks:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) It can render an organisation particularly vulnerable to pressure as its profile and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reputation are focused on an individual personality.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) The absence of an effective senior executive board with non-executive input can expose</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the office to a presidential style of leadership, with insufficient internal checks and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">balances to ensure that its overall priorities remain congruent with its statutory functions.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) The absence of an effective senior executive board can also, as a simple matter of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">business management, mean that priorities, business risks, resources and performance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are not managed and monitored coherently.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-7"><a href="#para4-7" name="para4-7">4.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The merits by contrast of a formal Board constitution potentially include the following:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) The benefits of collective decision making. This includes being able to bring a range of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different expertise, experience and mindset to issues of strategy, priority and direction,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and an enrichment of analysis, debate and perspective as a result.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) Firmer discipline can be maintained in decision-making, including the need to proceed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by means of structured agendas, formal papers and recorded minutes. This is of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular importance in relation to decisions<span style="font-style:italic"> not</span> to take action; when such decisions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are taken individually or informally they are much more likely not to have been made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from a structured position of strength.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) There are formal and precisely defined delegations and it is beyond doubt where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decisions are to be delegated to the executive as not requiring Board approval.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">All of these have a potential to promote collective decision-making as much more transparent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and accountable. Each decision will thus both be more considered in itself and more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">susceptible to structured follow-through to specific outcomes.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-8"><a href="#para4-8" name="para4-8">4.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence before the Inquiry suggested that the constitution of the ICO as a corporation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sole may, in at least some of these dimensions, have risked its ability to discharge effectively</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its functions in relation to the press. Unresolved questions must remain, for example, as to</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">whether:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) the informal approach adopted by the ICO to its regulatory functions (partly a matter,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">perhaps, of presiding over a regime struggling for a profile, also possibly a matter of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal leadership style) has contributed to a reluctance to bring issues to a head</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">through the use of regulatory powers, and has allowed inaction to be an unremarked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">default within its own structure;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) the tendencies of Information Commissioners to see themselves as having a major,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">even dominant, outward-facing role with a political or campaigning dimension has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the expense of their ability to provide clear, engaged, understood and accountable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">leadership in the decisions made within their office, to the detriment of the quality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of those decisions, and has posed some risk to the regulatory reputation of the ICO,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including in relation to its quasi-judicial functions; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) its current constitution leaves the ICO with insufficient strength to match major business</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sectors with power and influence, such as the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-9"><a href="#para4-9" name="para4-9">4.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I recommend therefore that the opportunity be taken by the Ministry of Justice to consider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">amending the DPA formally to reconstitute the ICO as an Information Commission, led by a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Board of Commissioners with suitable expertise drawn from the worlds of regulation, public</span>
<a name="page1109"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">administration, law and business, and that active consideration be given in that context to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">desirability of including on the Board a Commissioner from the media sector. In making this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendation I do not, however, consider that the recommendations directed to reflecting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the governance of the ICO as currently constituted should be delayed in the meantime.</span>
