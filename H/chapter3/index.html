<h1>CHAPTER 3<br/>OTHER POSSIBLE REGULATORY OPTIONS</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Criminal proceedings in respect of journalists</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">No journalist was ever subject to prosecution as a result of Operation Motorman. Indeed,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ICO never got as far even as interviewing any journalist in connection with examining the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">possibility of criminal proceedings (however limited the value of doing so might have been).</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is considerable dispute as to why that happened.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The account provided by Alex Owens is that, within weeks of the commencement of work on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the electronic discs of the Motorman material, they were:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;informed that we were not to make contact with any of the newspapers identified</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and we were not to speak to, let alone, interview any journalists. Despite our protests</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we were told this was the decision of Richard Thomas and that he would deal with the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press involvement by way of the Press Complaints Council. It was at this moment we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">knew no journalist could or ever would be prosecuted in relation to our investigation.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">No journalist or Newspaper Group was ever spoken to by anyone from the Information</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Commissioner&#8217;s Investigations Unit in relation to Operation Motorman. We also now</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">knew that one of the major questions that needed to be asked but could never be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">asked, let alone answered was &#8217;Why did you want all these ex-directory / mobile /</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">family and friend telephone numbers and most importantly what were you doing with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">them?&#8217;&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He was, he said, given to understand that the focus of continuing criminal investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was to be exclusively on the private investigators, the blaggers and the corrupt officials and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">employees:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Basically they&#8217;d drawn a red line, with the press and the reporters above that line and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we dealt with anything below that line.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He described the way in which the team continued to prepare papers for conspiracy charges in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">respect of the remaining defendants (specimen charges relating to breach of s55 of the Act),</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">interviewed some 50 to 60 victims and (under caution) all persons suspected of the unlawful</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obtaining, disclosing or blagging on behalf of Mr Whittamore. This material was passed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ICO legal department for action and, by February 2004, the work was completed. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described having attended a conference with external counsel, in October 2003, in order</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to consider the weight of the evidence, and the written advice received that December</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which supported taking forward the conspiracy charges. counsel also directly addressed the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question of criminal proceedings against journalists, advising:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Having regard to the sustained and serious nature of the journalistic involvement in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the overall picture, there can be little doubt that many, perhaps all, of the journalists</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">involved have committed offences.</span>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref3" name="footnote3" title="Go back to footnote reference 3 in the text">3</a>.  pp32-33, lines 4-22, Alexander Owens, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-5-December-2011.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The inference, overwhelming, it seems to me, is that several editors must have been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">well aware of what their staff were up to and therefore party to it. I understand that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">policy considerations have led to the view that enforcement of some sort rather than</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">prosecution is the way forward in respect of the journalists/newspapers.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I understand and sympathise with that approach. This is, I believe, the first occasion</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">upon which the scale of the problem has come to light and it may not be unreasonable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to give the Press Complaints Commission the chance to put their house in order.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the basis of that policy, counsel considered whether journalists or editors should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cautioned in the light of the evidence of the extent of their involvement and the &#8216;often</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unpleasant&#8217; nature of the offending. He also registered a measure of anxiety about taking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">forward the conspiracy charges to the exclusion of press defendants:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Those defending in the prosecution might seek to make capital from the fact that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the journalists are not being prosecuted. The judge might also comment on the basis</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the journalists are the ones (it seems) who created the demand for this offending.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">With this in mind, it is a sensible precaution to equip me at some point before trial with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the detail of the reasoning not to prosecute. I may need to explain or even defend the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decision to the judge.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is no evidence that a detailed statement was in fact produced.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">After completing work on the files, on Mr Owens&#8217;s account:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;we received no feed back whatsoever as to what action was being taken in relation to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the press&#8217;s involvement. On those occasions we did ask the question the only response</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we received was that &#8216;Richard [the Commissioner] was dealing with it&#8217;.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The prosecution was ultimately conducted by the CPS and he describes how the ICO was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">neither formally aware of or involved in the prosecution of Mr Whittamore; the next they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">heard, in April 2005, was that he had been conditionally discharged by the Crown Court at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Blackfriars. Mr Owens left the ICO at around this time, with, he said, unanswered questions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about what if any action had been taken in respect of the press, and why such prosecution as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had proceeded seemed to have involved Mr Whittamore but none of the other conspirators.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He concluded that &#8216;something had gone drastically wrong with the prosecution case&#8217;,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">producing an outcome which did not begin to do justice to the Motorman material.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On Mr Owens&#8217;s account, therefore, the suggestion within the Motorman material of<span style="font-style:italic"> prima</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">intervention of a policy decision by Mr Thomas to proceed with the matter himself and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exclusively in dialogue with the PCC as a result of, or additionally because of, a reluctance to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">engage directly in enforcement action in relation to the press prevented this from happening.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This account was vigorously disputed by both Mr Aldhouse and Mr Thomas. The evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Mr Aldhouse was that there was no policy, or none that he was aware of, of holding back</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the prosecution of journalists. He was clear that he was not involved in the operational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision-making at all; however, if he had been asked, he would have considered that there</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">was indeed a case for taking the involvement of journalists and newspapers in criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behaviour further. Nor would he have thought resourcing problems a conclusive argument</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">against doing so: he thought that it would have been possible to have discussed the possibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of supplementary funding with the sponsoring government department. But he did not apply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his mind to such considerations at the time; it was not his place to do so. He was aware of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">measure of frustration in the investigations team that no action had been taken in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press, and of some discussion about the disappointing criminal process in the office, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could recall no detail.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas also denied any positive policy decision or instruction being given not to proceed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with criminal investigations into press conduct. This denial was emphatic and can be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enumerated:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) &#8220;there was no such policy decision, certainly not at the early stage&#8221;;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) &#8220;[it] is possible that Mr Owens has somehow confused or conflated all the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">dates and interpreted that [Mr Thomas going to the PCC] as some sort of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">policy or some sort of instruction, but that was not the case&#8221;;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) &#8220;[if] there was a policy, it was not one which I had any hand in, one which I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">knew about, which I made or which I was told about&#8221;;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(d) &#8220;as far as I&#8217;m aware, there was absolutely no such policy and I can&#8217;t think why</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there would have been such a policy&#8221;;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(e) &#8220;what I&#8217;m trying to say &#8211; and I hope I&#8217;m coming across very clearly &#8211; is that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there was no policy from the outset that we weren&#8217;t going to go against the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">press&#8221;;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(f) &#8220;Q: Your evidence is that the policy steer didn&#8217;t come from you?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: Absolutely not&#8221;;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(g) &#8220;there is clear evidence that there was not a policy conclusion even at that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">point [the approach to the PCC]&#8221;;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(h) &#8220;I don&#8217;t accept that there was a policy decision. I don&#8217;t accept that we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">abandoned the possibility of prosecuting journalists.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Indeed, Mr Thomas was insistent in his evidence that there was no &#8216;conscious decision&#8217; at all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not to prosecute journalists.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup> He explained that in two different ways although, on the face</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of it, these are not entirely straightforward to reconcile. He said both that he assumed that</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">in fact the office was making progress with the prosecution of journalists as they would with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any other criminal investigation,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup> and also that there was an active plan to keep the option of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecution alive but to wait and see first how the conspiracy prosecutions being undertaken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the CPS fared, and in due course, if all went well, to activate them.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Taking the second of these first, the problem with any &#8216;wait and see&#8217; strategy was articulated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by Mr Owens. He described his response to the way in which the discontinuance of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal proceedings for conspiracy was described in<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy?</span> in the following</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;This was a great disappointment to the ICO, especially at it seemed to underplay the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">seriousness of section 55 offences. It also meant that it was not in the public interest</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to proceed with the ICO&#8217;s own prosecutions, nor could the Information Commissioner</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contemplate bringing prosecutions against the journalists or others to whom</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">confidential information had been supplied.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-11"><a href="#para1-11" name="para1-11">1.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As Mr Owens explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It may be correct in relation to the others, you know, the blaggers and the thing, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you could never go back after three years and contemplate prosecuting journalists.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">They&#8217;d never even been investigated. And I &#8211; there&#8217;s enough legal people here to know</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">if I &#8211; I kept evidence &#8211; you can&#8217;t put &#8211; if you have a conspiracy, you can&#8217;t put five people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the back-burner and wait and see how you got on with the same five people in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the front that&#8217;s getting prosecuted, because you got a good result, right, we&#8217;ll go and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">prosecute them as well. Well, they&#8217;re all part of one conspiracy. You either investigate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">them all, or those five you have to say we&#8217;re not going to investigate them which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">means we&#8217;re not going to prosecute them. I don&#8217;t know whether that would be - is the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">correct word abuse of the justice system?&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-12"><a href="#para1-12" name="para1-12">1.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In my judgment, as a matter of criminal process, the proposition that the journalists were not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigated because there was a deliberate strategy which had been thought through (in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">light of evidence that was known about and understood) simply to see how the prosecutions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">against the &#8216;middle men&#8217; went before proceeding against the press is neither credible nor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sustainable. In any event, there is no contemporaneous evidence that this was indeed the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strategy. This is very different from a decision not to proceed for good operational reasons,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">followed by a later re-evaluation.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-13"><a href="#para1-13" name="para1-13">1.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The other argument advanced by Mr Thomas was that there was indeed an active policy to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pursue criminal inquiries into the activities of the press, but that they ran their operational</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">course to no effect. He suggested a number of operational reasons for the ICO not, in the end,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proceeding with criminal proceedings in respect of the press. They included:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) the inevitability that severe and disproportionate logistical difficulties would be faced,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including the commitment of significant resources;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) legal uncertainty about the difficulty of proving &#8216;procuring&#8217; of disclosure by the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(which would require establishing knowledge or recklessness about the lack of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual&#8217;s consent) and about the possible deployment of public interest defences</span>

<p id="para-id-1-14"><a href="#para1-14" name="para1-14">1.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The difficulty with any or all of these explanations is that, on Mr Thomas&#8217;s own account, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry saw no evidence that at the time the ICO went through a strategic decision-making</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">process which actively considered any of these points and reached a conclusion on them.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There clearly would have been the need for major decisions to have been taken one way or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the other about the allocation of resources, significant operational planning and close liaison</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the police and the CPS. There is no evidence that any of this happened. On the contrary,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the best evidence available to the Inquiry suggests that:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) there was prima facie evidence of criminal behaviour by journalists;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) this was investigated up to a point within the ICO by paper analysis and by interviewing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a selected group of victims;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) external counsel encouraged the view that the evidence of criminal conduct by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists was persuasive and that there were merits in taking the matter further; but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) the matter was not taken any further by the ICO in relation to data protection offences,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not even to the stage of approaching a single journalist either to be interviewed or for</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">a statement.</span>

 <p id="para-id-1-15"><a href="#para1-15" name="para1-15">1.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas was either unaware that the matter was not proceeding within his office, or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aware of it without challenging that state of affairs. Either is problematic. The first suggests a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disconnection from one of the biggest operational cases the ICO ever dealt with to a degree</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which is difficult to understand. After all, this was a case on which he himself spent many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">years pursuing at a strategic and political level. There was this exchange:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q: When the prosecution started, there were no journalists there. Did you not think</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about that?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: I wasn&#8217;t involved in these meetings.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q: No &#8230; not the meetings, but you were alert as to what was going on with the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">prosecution process?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Only in very general terms and I have no recollection.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At the very least, the second explanation raises questions about the extent of the interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that Mr Thomas had in this aspect of the enforcement of the data protection regime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">notwithstanding the extent of the abuse revealed by Operation Motorman.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-16"><a href="#para1-16" name="para1-16">1.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This important matter was directly put in this way by Robert Jay QC to Mr Thomas when he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gave evidence:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;May I try and sum up the position in this way? Given two facts which we know, Mr</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Thomas &#8211; the first fact is that the journalists were never interviewed by your office and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the second fact is that such an interview would be a sine qua non to a prosecution,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">out of fairness to the journalists on the one hand, in order to obtain further evidence -</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">does it not follow that either there was a policy decision not to pursue that course or,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">alternatively, there were operational failures or decisions by the investigators not to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">carry out an elementary step, namely to interview?&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-17"><a href="#para1-17" name="para1-17">1.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas challenged that dichotomy, but only by way of suggesting that an alternative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was the &#8216;wait and see&#8217; policy which is not, itself, obviously compatible with an omission to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interview any journalist in a timely fashion. Mr Jay therefore put the analysis to him even</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more directly:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. &#8220;So at the moment I am thrashing around mentally to see what other alternative</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there might be beyond a policy decision on the one hand or incompetence in your</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation officers on the other.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. &#8220;Well, if you want to put it in those terms, I have to put it to the latter, but I am</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">absolutely &#8211; you know, absolutely clear because I wouldn&#8217;t have done any of the things</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I had done right through 2005, 2006, 2007 if I had thought at any time that I or anybody</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">else had said: &#8216;Back off the journalists&#8217;.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-18"><a href="#para1-18" name="para1-18">1.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is an answer which has difficulties at many levels and, in fairness to Mr Thomas, may not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bear too close an analysis. As between a policy or an operational failure there are perhaps</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">levels of intermediate gradation. It is, however, necessary to take stock of the issue of non-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecution of journalists by the ICO.</span>

 <p id="para-id-1-19"><a href="#para1-19" name="para1-19">1.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the first place, it does not seem that there need have been any reason from the outset for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ICO not to have proceeded down the path towards active pursuit of prosecution. Mr Jay</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">put it this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;But if all one needed to do: &#8220;Let&#8217;s cherry pick the best cases of illegality. The friends</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and family cases, the one or two police national computer cases. We&#8217;ll interview the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalists in those cases. We might interview the editors.&#8221; That is a fairly narrow</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">exercise. You can then assess how strong the case is. After all, if the evidence is strong</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enough, you might even get guilty pleas. Who knows?&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-20"><a href="#para1-20" name="para1-20">1.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Alotof evidencewasavailable,andagooddealofworkwasdoneintheearlystages.MrOwens</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">took the point that it might not have required a huge amount of delving and interrogation by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">him in relation to the relevant journalists to get the answers he needed to the questions in his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mind (which principally concerned why they wanted the material). Some might have declined</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to answer; of those who answered, some answers might have incriminated journalists, others</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might have exonerated them.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup> But the questions were never asked. It would not have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operationally impossible, and ought perhaps to have been operationally rather attractive, to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have proceeded in the way Mr Jay hypothesised. But there was no indication that this was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ever contemplated, far less attempted.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-21"><a href="#para1-21" name="para1-21">1.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the second place, although I recognise that the conditional discharge imposed on Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whittamore meant that there was little practical prospect of resuming criminal investigations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to the press for the reasons outlined above, such an outcome was hardly possible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to foresee. The record that the ICO made of the hearing before His Honour Judge Samuels QC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the Crown Court at Blackfriars in April 2005 (including his sentencing remarks)<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup> does not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the face of it even support the proposition that the prosecution of journalists was out of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the question following the conditional discharge of Mr Whittamore.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-22"><a href="#para1-22" name="para1-22">1.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">From this note, it is possible to derive the following propositions:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) The sentence in this case was clearly to a degree based on the particular position</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a co-defendant (previously sentenced in ignorance of this prosecution) and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unchallenged personal circumstances of Mr Whittamore who was described as of</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">previous good character; in a state of depression; &#8216;reclusive&#8217;; &#8216;probably a broken man&#8217; of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">limited means, unemployed and effectively unemployable in his previous line of work.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) There were procedural considerations militating strongly in favour of a swift disposal of</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">the case.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) There is no indication at all that the sentencing judge considered the offending</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behaviour not to be serious in nature; on the contrary, he observed:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;The</span><span style="font-style:italic"> vice</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">primary conspiracy was to make known to the press information which on any view</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ought to have been confidential &#8230; I refer to the vice and I do so again as a warning to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">others; others cannot expect leniency as seen today.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-23"><a href="#para1-23" name="para1-23">1.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">To be fair to Mr Thomas and the ICO, it is right to record that there were some issues about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the nature and extent of the co-operation between the ICO on the one hand and the police</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We had never been advised that the matter was due before the courts. We were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">never given the opportunity to attend even though we had been the investigating</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">officers and were never given any details of what had happened in relation to all the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other defendants we had anticipated would be jointly charged with Whittamore for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">conspiracy&#8230; we did hear that there had been some conflict between the ICO legal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">team and the Crown Prosecution Service/Metropolitan Police&#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-24"><a href="#para1-24" name="para1-24">1.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas put the matter in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I also understand that there was a feeling that the prosecutor had not accurately</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">conveyed some of the material to the court vis-a-vis the journalistic aspect, and I can&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">turn it up straight away now, but some of the notes you&#8217;ve had from the ICO&#8217;s legal file</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">indicated that the barrister for the CPS had not perhaps conveyed the full picture. We&#8217;d</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sort of &#8211; if you like, were not actively engaged or involved in that.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-25"><a href="#para1-25" name="para1-25">1.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is neither possible nor necessary to reach any conclusion about the extent to which a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">failure of liaison impacted on this prosecution, although a close and mutually supportive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship between ICO, police and CPS in this type of case is clearly important.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-26"><a href="#para1-26" name="para1-26">1.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Putting to one side the issues which flow from a consideration of the result of the prosecution,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and reverting to the initial decisions, the conflict between the investigator, Mr Owens, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas remains real. Mr Owens bluntly put the matter in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup></span>
<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion I would summarize by saying it is my opinion that:</p>
<ul>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;"><li> ICO&#8217;s decision not to investigate any journalist in relation to Operation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Motorman was a wrong decision.</span></li>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;"><li> This decision was certainly not based on any advice given by counsel or on any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">lack of evidence, as ICO would have everyone believe. The decision had been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">made long before the involvement of any Counsel or opinions being requested</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and there was overwhelming evidence that many of the journalists did know</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or at least should have known the information they were requesting could only</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be obtained illegally and what they were requesting was not for a purpose</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which would carry any form of &#8217;public interest&#8217; defence.</span></li>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;"><li> The decision not to pursue any journalist was based solely on fear - fear of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the power, wealth and influence of the Press and the fear of the backlash that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could follow if the press turned against ICO.</li></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;"><li> The publication in May 2006 of &#8217;What price privacy&#8217; was no more than an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">attempt to lock the stable door after the horse had bolted in an effort to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cover up the fact that ICO had failed in its duty to conduct a full and proper</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation into the conduct of journalists at the time when they could and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should have.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;"><p>Throughout the whole of the time the Motorman investigation was ongoing there was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">never any mention or suggestion of any report being commissioned for Parliament. I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">feel it was no coincidence that this report was not published until May 2006, only a few</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">weeks before the Mulcaire scandal broke. It is my belief that when ICO became aware</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the Metropolitan Police were conducting yet another investigation involving more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wrong doings by the Press, they decided to pre-empt and deflect any criticism which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was bound to be directed towards them in relation to their lack of action against the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Press in Operation Motorman.</span></p>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;"><p>All the evidence published in this report had been gathered and had been available</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">since March 2003, so if as David Smith stated, again in the Panorama Report, ICO</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wanted to send &#8220;an effective and final warning&#8221; then why did it take over three years to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">prepare it, and not publish it until 13 months after the prosecution against Whittamore</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">had concluded.</p></span>

<p id="para-id-1-27"><a href="#para1-27" name="para1-27">1.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These are stark allegations, which Mr Thomas firmly invited the Inquiry to reject. One of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his reasons was that Mr Owens&#8217; evidence must be regarded as unreliable as he had parted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the ICO on unhappy terms and that must be taken to have clouded his judgment on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this matter. However, insofar as this Report comes to any conclusions on these issues it does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so on their own merits rather than on the basis of speculation by Mr Owens on matters</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not within his personal knowledge. On the other hand there is no reason to doubt that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Owens&#8217; evidence was, at least, an authentic description of his own perspective.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, it cannot be overlooked that, by their own accounts, the senior management</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the ICO had placed Mr Owens and his immediate superior in a position in which their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perspectives were operationally determinative: it was a matter for them.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-28"><a href="#para1-28" name="para1-28">1.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I start from this proposition. The evidential &#8216;treasure trove&#8217; of the Motorman material, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">questions of public interest and of the integrity of the data protection regime, the seriousness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the breaches of trust evidently involved and the potential harm occasioned to a very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">large number of individuals all make it very hard to reconcile the evident lack of analysis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or a discernible action plan in the ICO for consideration of criminal investigations into press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">misconduct. Whether, in the end, the decision was taken to pursue those investigations or not,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the matter should have been consciously and conscientiously considered and decided upon</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from an operational and strategic point of view. The decisions should have been reasoned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and recorded. The evidence is that this did not happen. It is possible (although I do not say</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more) that a significant opportunity was thereby lost to challenge and check elements in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">culture, practices and ethics of the press that were insufficiently mindful of the law, the rights</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and entitlements of individuals, the public interest and the obligations of good practice.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-29"><a href="#para1-29" name="para1-29">1.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Before reaching any firm conclusions, however, it is also necessary to provide the context</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the alternatives available to the ICO, the choices made and the outcomes in practice. Mr</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thomas said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref38" href="#footnote38">38</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;it&#8217;s important to record that prosecution is not the only way to deal with a particular</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">problem.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Motorman was clear evidence of a problem in the culture, practices and ethics of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press. It was not dealt with by criminal investigation and prosecution. The ICO was, on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its own account, not primarily a prosecuting authority; it was a statutory regulator, provided</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with a range of standard regulatory powers and had a range of other powers and operational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">choices available.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-30"><a href="#para1-30" name="para1-30">1.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas shared with the Inquiry the thought that there might even have been a causative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship between his understanding from his staff that the prosecution of journalists was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not a plausible option, and his decision to take the matter to the PCC. He accepted that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thought was to a degree<span style="font-style:italic"> ex</span><span style="font-style:italic"> post</span><span style="font-style:italic"> facto</span> rationalisation, and it is not certain from the chronology</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref38" name="footnote38" title="Go back to footnote reference 38 in the text">38</a>.  p70, lines 8-10, Richard Thomas, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-9-December-2011.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
 <span style="font-size: 15px;">that it can have been the case (he also said elsewhere that the reason he refused to go into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operational detail with the PCC was that the prosecutions were still<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;under</span><span style="font-style:italic"> way.&#8221;</span> )<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref39" href="#footnote39">39</a></sup> But, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the light of the eclipse of the prosecution option, the way he put the position of the ICO in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to what the evidence discovered in Operation Motorman revealed about the culture,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and ethics of the press must surely be regarded as authentic:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We can&#8217;t leave it there. We must do something.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The &#8216;something&#8217; in Mr Thomas&#8217;s mind was his twin-track political strategy. But the question</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also has powerful operational resonance. If the ICO was not to tackle the press by the route</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of criminal investigation, the &#8216;something&#8217; else must be considered.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. The use of regulatory powers</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One of the striking features of the narrative that started with Operation Motorman is that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">neither during the criminal investigation nor at any time thereafter does it appear that there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was any evaluation of alternative operational steps which remained available. On the contrary,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ICO appears to have put faith only in prosecution and the twin track strategy championed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personally by Mr Thomas. However, the &#8216;treasure trove&#8217; of material gave rise to a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important operational issues and permitted a variety of regulatory responses.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was certainly the question of future deterrence, which featured so prominently in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas&#8217; campaign. There was also the wider operational question already noted: it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unlikely that Mr Whittamore was the sole operator in this evidently lucrative market, so how</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">big, in fact, was the problem? This was something to which<span style="font-style:italic"> only</span> the press, as drivers of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">market as evidenced by the Motorman material, were likely to be able to provide a clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">answer.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There were issues at a more specific level as well. The Motorman material suggested that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press was in possession of a quantity of material in breach of the data protection principles</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and of the rights of the individuals involved. If their acquisition of that material was unlawful,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then their continuing holding and use of the material was likely to be unlawful and unfair</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also. Motorman raised questions not merely of past illegality (obtaining the information) but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of present and continuing illegality.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That, indeed, was the distinguishing feature of the role of the press in the narrative. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">blaggers and the corrupt officials and employees could be identified and their practices</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terminated. But, unless they had taken active steps (which might include destruction) in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to the personal information, the press were likely to be persisting in conduct unlawful</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under the data protection regime on a daily basis. Even holding information unlawfully and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unfairly is a potential breach, whether or not accompanied by further breaches, intended</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breaches, or indeed any further plans or actions at all. Every day which passed raised acute</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practical and operational issues in relation to the press. How much personal information were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they holding unlawfully, and how should the situation be remedied and lawfulness assured?</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These issues were live and acute, and not even prosecution of the press would have been a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complete answer to them. Although criminal investigation would have got to the bottom of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the specimen cases pursued and no doubt would have had a salutary chilling effect of some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sort on unlawful practice, it could never have been the thorough-going systemic look at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Motorman material in the hands of the press, nor the systemic rectification of any continuing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unlawfulness, which the evidence required.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref39" name="footnote39" title="Go back to footnote reference 39 in the text">39</a>.  p119, lines 5-6, Richard Thomas,<em> <em>ibid</em></em></p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref40" name="footnote40" title="Go back to footnote reference 40 in the text">40</a>.  p62, lines 15-16, Richard Thomas, <em>ibid</em></p><!--footnote-->
 <p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The seizure of the Motorman material was, in other words, a very major case of the sort which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statutory regulators are created (and given practical powers) to deal with. The press were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under continuing legal obligations to consider what steps were needed to clean up their own</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operations from the products of the unlawful trade in personal information. Even if defences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may have been available in some cases to criminal charges, a significant number of questions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would have been outstanding as to the extent to which the press had complied with their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">civil legal obligations and with standards of good practice under the data protection regime.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is therefore significant that Mr Thomas confirmed that the ICO did not, at any point, come</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">close to considering the use of the civil enforcement powers at their disposal either to seek</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further information from the press or to require them to comply with the data protection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regime. Evidently,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;some</span><span style="font-style:italic"> sort</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> passing</span><span style="font-style:italic"> thought</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> given</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> but</span><span style="font-style:italic"> nothing</span><span style="font-style:italic"> materialised&#8221;</span> .</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That was for two principal reasons. The first was that these powers were, in any event, rarely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">used. The second was that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;everybody</span><span style="font-style:italic"> knew</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> large</span><span style="font-style:italic"> extent</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> powers</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span></span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is evident, as considered at the outset of this Part of the Report, that there were questions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the operational experience in the ICO at the time of the deployment of its formal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory powers, and particularly so in relation to the press. That is further considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">below, as is the question whether the investigative and enforcement powers of the ICO in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to the press were, indeed, as a matter of law insufficient to allow the questions raised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the press by Motorman to be effectively tackled by the regulator.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At this stage, it is sufficient to articulate the following concerns:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) The Inquiry saw no evidence that any of these matters were the subject of serious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consideration within the ICO.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) The Inquiry received a quantity of evidence as to how far the Motorman material could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be considered<span style="font-style:italic"> prima</span><span style="font-style:italic"> facie</span> evidence of criminality on the part of journalists (not least</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because of the question of intent), but it is not credible to argue otherwise than that it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was<span style="font-style:italic"> prima</span><span style="font-style:italic"> facie</span> evidence of extensive unlawful and unethical data protection practice.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) Whether the press would have had an answer to that<span style="font-style:italic"> prima</span><span style="font-style:italic"> facie</span> unlawfulness certainly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fell to be considered and, to such extent as it did, so the evidence is that the ICO was of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the view that that was highly unlikely to be the case.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup> The substantive exemptions from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the principles and rights of the data protection regime in favour of the press may have</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">been extensive, but they were not limitless. It was not open to the ICO on the evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Motorman material to conclude with any confidence that the press had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acting within its rights so far as personal information privacy was concerned.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) The procedural hurdles standing in the way of formal proceedings by the ICO against</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press may have been daunting &#8211; but it is not credible that Parliament intended</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them to be insuperable. If ever an operational data protection issue arose where active</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contemplation of regulatory action in respect of the press presented itself (I put it no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">higher), Motorman was surely that case.</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) Not only was there no evidence that serious operational attention was given to these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues, either at the time or at any point since, it is noteworthy that at no stage since</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Motorman material was found has the ICO raised as an issue the sufficiency of its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">powers to tackle breach of the data protection regime by the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In relation to this last point, at no point during his long campaign on custodial penalties did</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas seek reform of the provisions applying the civil law to the press. The present</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham, does not do so today. That left the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the question of whether the powers available to the ICO were in fact adequate for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the task of pursuing with the press the continuing operational issues raised by Motorman,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but were neglected by the ICO; or whether they were inadequate, and the ICO has chosen,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for whatever reason, not to draw attention to their inadequacy. Both Commissioners have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strongly argued on these points that they have other priorities and that, whatever the legal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">position, it would not have been right for them to place the practices of the press among</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those priorities. I reflect on that in due course.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Not for the last time in this Report, a haunting question asked by Mr Owens arises. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described himself musing on the operational implications for the press of the Motorman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It&#8217;s our job to take them or indeed anyone else on, that&#8217;s what we are paid to do. If</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we do not do it, then who does?&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The question is even more pertinent in relation to civil law enforcement under the data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protection regime than it was to the question of prosecution. The CPS can always take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecution decisions (including in relation to s55) and consider the matter from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perspective of the totality of any apparent criminality. Only the ICO is able to take regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforcement action. If anything, the pertinence of this question has only increased over time.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">None of this is to suggest that the ICO<span style="font-style:italic"> should</span> have had recourse to testing its formal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigatory and enforcement powers in practice in this case, but simply that it might have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been expected to give the question urgent and detailed consideration. No regulator would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expect as a matter of routine to make the formal assertion of its powers its first reaction,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although in an egregious or systemic case (and Motorman was surely such a case) that may be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate. To the extent that criminal proceedings remained in active contemplation there</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">would in any event have been a need for detailed consideration of the potential interactions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between criminal and civil investigations. However, if not formal action, possibly as a prelude</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the active consideration of formal action, the operational imperative to &#8216;do something&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the Motorman problem with the press might at least have been expected to direct the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mind of the ICO to the possible effectiveness of a range of informal steps.</span>

<h2>3.  Engagement with the industry: guidance and promoting good practice</h2>


<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Under the DPA, the ICO has a general legal obligation to:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;promote the following of good practice by data controllers and, in particular, so to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">perform his functions under this Act as to promote the observance of the requirements</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of this Act by data controllers&#8221;.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref43" name="footnote43" title="Go back to footnote reference 43 in the text">43</a>.  p7, para 4.5, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Witness-Statement-of-Alexander-Owens1.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref44" name="footnote44" title="Go back to footnote reference 44 in the text">44</a>.  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/section/51</p><!--footnote-->
 <span style="font-size: 15px;">The press organisations involved in the Motorman case were undoubtedly data controllers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for these purposes and &#8216;good practice&#8217; can refer to standards over and above the strict legal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requirements of the data protection regime. Therefore, even assuming that the ICO had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered that, in the case of the press, its own powers were too restricted or restrictive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for formal regulatory action to be the best way to proceed, its duty to promote good practice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would still have been engaged. Mr Thomas described his entire twin-track strategy to have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been undertaken in furtherance of his duty to promote good practice but the duty was also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant to the operational imperative. That imperative was to tackle the questions raised by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the fact that, so far as the ICO had reason to believe, the Motorman material remained in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the hands of the press in circumstances which, at the very least, raised specific and systemic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">questions of good practice, standards and ethics.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first recourse of a regulator is not usually to formal proceedings. In those circumstances,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is more usual to make informal contact in order to follow up an apparent problem (which is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any practice falling short of desirable standards), hear the other side of the case, and seek to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">engage in a detailed dialogue about the nature and extent of the problem and the steps which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might be taken to address it satisfactorily. At the very least, the Motorman material revealed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the ICO that the press had engaged in questionable practice in relation to individuals&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information, that it remained in possession of that information in circumstances which, again</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the very least, raised questions about their conformity with good practice, and that good</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice would require some contemplation from the individuals&#8217; point of view as to whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">steps were needed to improve the situation. But the Inquiry saw no evidence that any of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these matters, any informal approach to the press data controllers or any assessment of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">immediate practical steps suggested by good practice, were actively contemplated let alone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">put into effect.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas said that he did, indeed, have it in mind to write to the various journalists and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editors involved, drawing attention to the fact that they were &#8216;incredibly lucky&#8217; not to have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been prosecuted (or, it might have been added, not to have been made the subject of formal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigatory or regulatory action).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup> Pressed as to why no attempt was in fact ever made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to engage with the individual newspapers, his answer was that, in going to the PCC, he had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;dealt with them all collectively&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Apart</span><span style="font-style:normal"> from</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> identified</span><span style="font-style:normal"> concern</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> this</span><span style="font-style:normal"> suggests</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lack of understanding of the role and responsibilities of the PCC, it implies that these were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mutually exclusive approaches. It also suggests that there was no imperative to deal with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">problem in the short term and in a practical way: that is to say, to address the issue not just</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press ceasing to commission further unlawful trade in personal information but also of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what it was doing with the information already in its possession as a result of that trade. As</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">noted above, the PCC itself urged Mr Thomas to engage directly with the industry and, in any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">event, showed little appetite to take the responsibility that Mr Thomas wished to pass on.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is also significant that there seems to have been no attempt to engage directly with the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(even indirectly, through the PCC) in the run up to the publication of<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy?</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That report was of course conceived principally from the perspective of a policy decision to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the effect that the introduction of custodial penalties for s55 was to be the principal means of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impacting on the unlawful trade in personal data. Considered, however, from an operational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">point of view, the lack of engagement with the press or any part of it on either the text or the</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">data tables is both striking and surprising. It afforded the industry no possibility of verifying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the data (the consequences of which, in at least one case, are considered further below).</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It also missed what might very well have been the prime opportunity to discuss with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry what practical lessons could be learned and what steps they ought to have taken or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be taking not only to remedy any persistent problems, but also to secure good practice for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the future. A not insignificant &#8216;carrot&#8217; might have been a willingness to include an account on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that exchange in the report to Parliament, thereby demonstrating that the press were taking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the issue seriously.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">MrThomas,however,saidthathesimplyreliedonthepublicationsofhisreportstoParliament</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to engender awareness amongst proprietors and editors at the national level of the ICO&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup> In relation to<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy?</span> he reported:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref49" href="#footnote49">49</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I would say that was promoting good practice, and sending it to a hundred</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">organisations with specific personalised letters saying &#8216;this is not acceptable&#8217; &#8230; I would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">say this is very much promoting good practice.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In reality, however, this was all rather late. It was three years after the event by which time the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">audit trail in relation to the Motorman material in the hands of the press was likely to have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gone very cold indeed. Three aspects of the conduct of the ICO are difficult to understand.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first is that if it was possible to prepare a large individual awareness exercise, complete</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with personalised letters in order to draw attention to<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy?</span> , and if that was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seen as an effective way to discharge the duty of the ICO to promote good practice, there is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no reason why similar attempts could not have been made at the time to contact the industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">directly. Second, while making every allowance for the decision to approach the PCC as a form</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of collective engagement with the press, the ICO did not recommend specific good practice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">steps to be promulgated to the industry as well as &#8216;general condemnation&#8217;. Third, when it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">becoming increasingly clear that the PCC was not going to act as an effective interlocutor with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the industry on behalf of the ICO&#8217;s operational concerns, even then, the ICO did not seek to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">communicate directly with the industry itself.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Even after the publication of<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy?</span> the process of preparing and issuing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effective good practice guidance to the press was faltering and inconclusive. Of the document</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">eventually produced, Mr Thomas said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It was a useful guidance note but I suppose I was a little concerned that it buried the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">section 55 warnings into a wider context of talking about the Data Protection Act and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">its application to the media more generally, and I think even now I would say that it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was a shame it didn&#8217;t just focus on section 55 in the way that our own note, which we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">produced, I think, in 2006 or 2007, what we call a good practice note, that was a very,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">very clear one and a half pager as to how the press should take seriously section 55.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In reality, the ICO did not direct the press towards the practical steps it needed to take,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not least in the maintenance of proper audit trails in relation to its handling of personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information (especially, as Mr Thomas had noted, in the event of an intention to rely on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public interest as a defence to s55). Rather, the process had become absorbed into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">managing the defensive stance of the press in response to the s55 campaign. A part of that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">response was the alleged discomfort of the press with applying legal public interest tests,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">notwithstanding the obvious centrality of judgments on the public interest to the routine</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">standards and ethics issues with which the press is inevitably concerned on a day to day basis.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Public interest judgements were also the daily bread and butter of the FOI regime which also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fell within the ICO&#8217;s regulatory remit and on which extensive and detailed guidance has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">published. Rather than pursuing the idea that the PCC would guide the press on this matter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operationally, along with the other possible lines of approach, it was eminently feasible for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ICO simply to grip the issue both efficiently and expeditiously.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, the ICO was under a continuing legal obligation to promote good practice,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including by considering the issue of guidance, either specific or general. It is not easy to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understand why the ICO persisted for years in trying to force the hand of the PCC to issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">guidance when it had statutory powers of its own to do so; moreover, these were statutory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">powers which it was under a legal obligation to keep under constant review. Having diagnosed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a need for guidance, and in the absence of a satisfactory and timely response from the PCC, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could have propelled the process forward with a comprehensive draft of its own, if necessary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in direct consultation with the industry. There is no evidence that it contemplated doing so.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-10"><a href="#para3-10" name="para3-10">3.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As noted above, one of the issues of contention between the ICO and the PCC over the course</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of its dialogue was the demand of the PCC for access to the<span style="font-style:italic"> detail</span> of the Motorman material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">before it would consider itself able to take direct action on any matter with the press (this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was Sir Christopher Meyer&#8217;s request for &#8216;beef&#8217;). The DPA includes a number of provisions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inhibiting disclosure by the ICO of confidential material it has acquired in the exercise of its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">functions;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">51</a></sup> this is a very standard feature of regulatory regimes. Those provisions would have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inhibited the public disclosure of the Motorman material, and were an operative reason for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the presentation of the material in the<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy?</span> reports in summarised form only.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Those provisions might also have rightly restrained the ICO from detailed disclosure to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC. But they would<span style="font-style:italic"> not</span> have restrained discussion by the ICO of the relevant parts of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Motorman material with the individual press organisations (data controllers) concerned for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the purposes of furthering their compliance with the legal or good practice requirements of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the regime. At the point at which Mr Thomas declined to share the detail of the Motorman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">materialwiththePCC,heeffectivelyacknowledgedthatdetailedandspecificdiscussionscould</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only ever have taken place directly between the ICO and the individual press organisations.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-11"><a href="#para3-11" name="para3-11">3.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On his own account, Mr Thomas was emphatic about the lack of engagement directly by the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Editors&#8217; Code Committee). But again, it was only the ICO that could have conversations with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual press organisations about their continued retention of the Motorman material;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was nobody else.</span>

<h2>4. Engagement with victims</h2>

<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Motorman material was evidence in the hands of the ICO that a very large number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">people appeared tohavebeen the victims of unlawful use of theirpersonal information. Those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals had rights and entitlements under the DPA, and in the civil law more generally,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including rights in relation to confidence and privacy. The data protection regime, in common</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with very many other regulatory regimes, provides for two routes of law enforcement. These</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are the exercise of investigatory and enforcement powers by the regulator and the availability</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of rights of action by individuals for the enforcement of the law in their own cases.</span>

 <p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One of the defining features of contravention of information privacy law is that,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">characteristically, the victim may not be aware that it has happened or, if aware, may have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no means to find out how it happened, who was responsible, or indeed to move beyond</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the realms of speculation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup> This feature was both obvious and commonplace when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consideration was directed to the Motorman material, and was equally a very real concern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which was underlined in the evidence of a number of Core Participants who complain about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press intrusion.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref54" href="#footnote54">54</a></sup> The ignorance of victims of the nature, or even existence, of the wrong</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">done to them is, indeed, a principal reason for the existence of a regulatory authority with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigative legal powers.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The two approaches to law enforcement are not, of course, mutually exclusive. Christopher</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Graham expressed the connection by describing what he saw as a core element of the ICO&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">job:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> arm</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> consumer,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> educate</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> empower</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> consumer</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> exercise</span><span style="font-style:italic"> their</span><span style="font-style:italic"> information</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">level, and at the level of assisting individuals who have concerns, including for example by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">helping them to make subject access requests.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref56" href="#footnote56">56</a></sup> Where the ICO comes upon evidence of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unlawful activity of which the victim is not aware, it has some important operational choices</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to make. Matters to be taken into account will include the quality of the evidence, the nature</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and extent of the apparent breach, whether or not it is continuing, the practicalities of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contacting victims, and so on. These were considerations which were brought to bear, for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">example, in the operation the ICO undertook in the wake of the loss by HMRC in late 2007</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of discs containing large quantities of personal information relating to the recipients of child</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">benefit. In part, at least, that was for the purposes of alerting the victims to the potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">need to take security measures against the possibility of the information falling into the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wrong hands and being used for fraudulent or other unlawful purposes in the future.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">No such exercise appears to have been contemplated in the Motorman case, a matter which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was directly raised in the Inquiry by potentially affected Core Participants. As noted above,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Owens&#8217; team did approach some 30 to 40 victims for the purposes of their criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation, and obtained witness statements. But engaging victims on the footing of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal investigation is a specific and limited kind of exercise and there is no evidence that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ICO engaged even those victims it approached for any broader purpose.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Aside from the primacy given to the criminal investigation at the time, Mr Thomas suggested</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there were two principal reasons for failing to engage with the victims. The first was</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">logistics, given the large number involved. The second was considerations of privacy, on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">basis that alerting victims could raise questions about possible further invasions of their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privacy, as might occur, for example, if third parties (including the victims&#8217; family members)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">came to be aware of information about them which the victim had been at pains to conceal.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref57" href="#footnote57">57</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Neither of these explanations fully accounts for the failure to take any operational hold of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">situation affecting the Motorman victims, although both concerns are certainly important</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and relevant. The former is a strategic challenge of a sort which the ICO has addressed on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other occasions. The latter is a matter of process, and of a nature which the ICO was well-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">placed to address. Neither points to complete inaction; neither would be insuperable given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case by case consideration.</span>

 <p id="para-id-4-7"><a href="#para4-7" name="para4-7">4.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The consequences of the failure to alert the victims were much debated before the Inquiry.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The ICO had placed considerable faith in the success of the political measures they took in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">response to Motorman to ensure that there was an effective stop to further victimisation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the future. It is, however, hard to avoid the conclusion that the position from the point</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of view of the victims was insufficiently taken into account, not merely operationally for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO, but also as a matter of respect for their rights and entitlements and so that they could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">properly consider their own law enforcement options, and take measures to deal with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">risks of further victimisation to which they could be subjected. That conclusion was also part</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Mr Owens&#8217; reflections:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref58" href="#footnote58">58</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We also had the unanswered outstanding question relating to the remaining</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">thousands of people who had never been told they had been a victim of crime having</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had their car checked, their ex directory telephone number unlawfully obtained, their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">private lists of family and friends sold to the Press and so on&#8230;. I also felt very strongly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the thousands of victims identified in Operation Motorman also had a right to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know they had been victims.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-8"><a href="#para4-8" name="para4-8">4.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The extent to which the perspective of the victims was overlooked may be connected with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the fact that the seriousness of the wrongdoing suggested by the Motorman material led the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO in two directions (prosecution and the campaign on s55) which were both in the criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">domain. Exclusive focus on the criminal aspects of what had been discovered, without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consideration of the wider regulatory context, carried a potential (if not an inevitable) risk</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the victims would be left out of the picture. That risk is evident in both the operational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and political reaction of the ICO to Motorman.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-9"><a href="#para4-9" name="para4-9">4.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The obvious question arising from the failure to alert the victims has come to the fore in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to all of the paths not taken by the ICO in response to Motorman: why, given the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obvious operational magnitude and seriousness of this case, was action evidently given such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a low priority? This is not a theoretical or historical question. The position of the victims was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a contemporary issue for the Inquiry. While the prospects, in practical reality, of the ICO</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taking criminal or regulatory action in relation to Motorman may be regarded (absent further,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fresher, evidence) as long since extinguished, individual victims expressed their concerns in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terms of whether their involvement in Motorman might not have been part of a much wider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context of their treatment at the hands of the press. There remained alive in their minds</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that question which Mr Owens said he had wanted to pursue: why did the press want their</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">information? And the follow-up questions also arose, including what did they do with it and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where was it now? This was the subject of a further ruling.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-10"><a href="#para4-10" name="para4-10">4.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of all of the questions which arose before the Inquiry about the operational steps which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ICO could have taken in response to the Motorman material, this question of alerting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the victims has clearly remained the most acute, notwithstanding the intervening years. For</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals, the question of what information a business holds about them, and what that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">business is doing with that information, is one of the core entitlements afforded by the data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protection regime. The affected Core Participants indeed felt sufficiently strongly about this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue that they pressed the Inquiry itself to undertake a disclosure exercise in relation to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Motorman material. For reasons set out in a further ruling the Inquiry concluded that that</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref58" name="footnote58" title="Go back to footnote reference 58 in the text">58</a>.  pp11-14, paras 4.17-5.5, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Witness-Statement-of-Alexander-Owens1.pdf</p><!--footnote-->

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">was not an appropriate focus of its own attention.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup> But it clearly remains a live issue for at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">least some of the victims; and of course in referring to victims, only a very small proportion of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those who were the subjects of material acquired by the press via Mr Whittamore, have had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that fact confirmed to them to this day.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-11"><a href="#para4-11" name="para4-11">4.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the circumstances, the Inquiry considered it appropriate to seek the views of the current</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Information Commissioner, Mr Graham, on the position of the Motorman victims from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perspective of the present day. The relevant Core Participants are also understood to have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approached him with a general inquiry. In his oral evidence, Mr Graham responded in this</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref61" href="#footnote61">61</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I had a letter last night, and no doubt this will be coming up later in the evidence,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">saying why have I not made contact with every individual whose name is mentioned</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the Motorman file? And part of the answer to that is going to be I would have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to take on a veritable army of extra people. I&#8217;m also going to say I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">necessary, but this isn&#8217;t practical. All regulators have to pick their battles, prioritise</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">their resources, and I just need some evidence of there being a problem before I divert</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">resources to do it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-12"><a href="#para4-12" name="para4-12">4.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Graham was not here necessarily disputing that there was evidence of a problem at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">time of the discovery of the Motorman material, but was questioning whether there was still</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a problem today. That line in his thinking, and the question of the prioritisation of operational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resources, are considered more fully below. But Mr Graham also suggested that there were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">two further practical problems.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-13"><a href="#para4-13" name="para4-13">4.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the first place, he reiterated Mr Thomas&#8217;s anxiety about occasioning further invasions of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privacy:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref62" href="#footnote62">62</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think Richard Thomas put the point very well in his response to you on this matter,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">when he said: if, having established the identity of the individual and their address, we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wrote to them to say simply, &#8220;Your details appear in the Motorman file, we can&#8217;t tell</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you why&#8221;, that might be an even greater breach of privacy than the original offence,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">because there would be a suggestion that there&#8217;s no smoke without fire. Other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">members of the family might see the letter and say, &#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s going on?&#8221; and I</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">couldn&#8217;t tell them any more than a name appears in a file.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry is not persuaded that what is a perfectly fair concern about further invasions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of privacy provides a reason for declining to contemplate alerting victims, nor that the risk</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of alerting third parties is one which could not, and cannot, reasonably be managed both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">through the means of communication and through the content.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-14"><a href="#para4-14" name="para4-14">4.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Graham advanced a second practical problem:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref63" href="#footnote63">63</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The difficulty about simply contacting everybody lies in the nature of the dossiers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">themselves. Mr Jay, you&#8217;ve seen them. I don&#8217;t know whether all the core participants</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are in that position, but these are notebooks, and sometimes the information contained</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in them is deeply obscure. I said in my witness statement that the individual who made</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the notes must have had a perfect understanding of what he was intending, but it isn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">always clear. That partly explains why there&#8217;s sometimes a discrepancy between the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">spreadsheets that we&#8217;ve compiled and the notebooks. If you said to me, &#8220;You ought to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">notify everybody whose name appears in the Motorman files&#8221;, I&#8217;d be hard pressed to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">do that. It isn&#8217;t just a question of resources, it&#8217;s it isn&#8217;t immediately clear who is being</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">referred to, because it isn&#8217;t just celebrities, it&#8217;s all sorts of people who may or may not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be part of a story concerning a celebrity or whatever it is; it&#8217;s just a name. Sometimes</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it&#8217;s just a surname&#8230;.It would be a phenomenal undertaking. Just because there&#8217;s a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">name, John Smith, I would then have to work out which John Smith. The example I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">gave to the Select Committee was iggy Stardust, that&#8217;s a bit easier to do, but there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are an awful lot of very anonymous names and it simply isn&#8217;t practical.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That may be a convincing explanation for the impossibility of contacting<span style="font-style:italic"> everyone</span> involved in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Motorman material. It is not a convincing explanation for not contacting anyone.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">There can be no doubt that a serious piece of work would be required for the ICO to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undertake a wholesale review of the Motorman victims, and legitimate questions do arise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about resources and priority. Mr Graham had his own suggestion about the way ahead:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref64" href="#footnote64">64</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;So far as the individuals are concerned, I&#8217;m still very ready for subject access requests</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by those who may be concerned&#8230;.if Hacked Off and their lawyers are representing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">particular individuals, then that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re here for; subject access requests, off we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">go.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Subject access requests allow individuals to exercise their entitlement under the data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protection regime to know from any business whether it holds information about them and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if so, what. They are not a straightforward answer to the problem. Unless individuals are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">already aware that a given title holds their information, the right could be exercised only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by a speculative correspondence across a range of newspapers and periodicals, at some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inconvenience and expense to both the person requesting and the subject of the request.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This therefore appears to be a paradigm case in which a statutory regulator could be expected</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">actively to consider providing assistance.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-16"><a href="#para4-16" name="para4-16">4.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is, no doubt, a range of practical solutions to this issue which both the ICO and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry could have offered to the Motorman victims at any point up to and including the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">present. One possible way forward would be for concerned individuals to be able to apply to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ICO seeking to obtain confirmation (in so far as the ICO is able to offer it) as to whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they can be identified among the Motorman victims and, if so, information as to the title or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">titles concerned and assistance, if necessary, in making a suitable request to those titles.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-17"><a href="#para4-17" name="para4-17">4.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If interest in exercising that right reached proportions beyond the capability of the ICO, then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perhaps the press organisations could be directed or encouraged each to undertake its own</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">victim contact exercise under the ICO&#8217;s supervision.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref65" href="#footnote65">65</a></sup> So far as the ICO is concerned, at any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rate, this suggests a course of action within its easily accessible knowledge and, subject to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasonable prioritisation, within its capability. This could have discharged its general functions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to satisfactory effect. There is no evidence that it was willing to turn its mind to any such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">possibility, either at the time or since.</span>

<h2>5.  Conclusions and the questions raised by Operation Motorman</h2>


<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Motorman was<span style="font-style:italic"> prima</span><span style="font-style:italic"> facie</span> evidence of systemic and serious malpractice by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press in relation to the acquisition and use of personal information. It was also one of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">biggest cases of deliberate and systemic data abuse of any sort to come to the attention of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ICO. In the view of the ICO itself the journalistic practices it disclosed on the face of it:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) were widespread and systemic;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) were probably criminal;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) suggested extensive and continuing breaches of the data protection principles;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) suggested large-scale and continuing breach of individual rights;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) at the least raised serious questions about standards and proper practices by the press;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(f) were unlikely to be an isolated example; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(g) had implications for the integrity of personal information, a number of public and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private databases, and the data protection regime as a whole.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Additionally, it was apparent to the ICO that the industry was not (at any rate at the time)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">denying that there was a problem.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref66" href="#footnote66">66</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This called for a commensurate response from the ICO which dealt with all aspects of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">problem and included challenging the practices and safeguarding both the information and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the position of the victims involved. It also presented a clear opportunity for a regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body to demonstrate publicly the importance and effectiveness of the data protection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regime in safeguarding the public interest in information privacy. The ICO was the best-placed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisation to grasp the implications of the Motorman material as a whole and to take a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decisive lead, working with other public authorities including the police and with the industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">itself, to ensure that a comprehensive and effective response was made to the evidence that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it disclosed of problems in the culture, practices and ethics of the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-3"><a href="#para5-3" name="para5-3">5.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">From an operational point of view, the ICO&#8217;s response to the Motorman material was not</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">commensurate with the scale of the problem disclosed. The Information Commissioner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ultimately considered that the problem was big enough for it to trouble Parliament and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government at the highest levels, including the Prime Minister. The contrast with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">insufficiency of its operational response is all the more obvious. The ICO is principally an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operational regulator, endowed with legal powers and functions to be exercised in the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest. Its principal role is not to act as a political campaigning body but to discharge its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory functions at a practical level.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-4"><a href="#para5-4" name="para5-4">5.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In particular, from an operational perspective, it appears that:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) there was an insufficiently strategic grasp of the operational issues and options facing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the organisation as a result of the material for fully informed decisions to be taken, or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the results to be followed through;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) theseniormanagementoftheICOinpracticegaveinsufficientprioritytotheoperational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dimension of the Motorman material;</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref66" name="footnote66" title="Go back to footnote reference 66 in the text">66</a>.  pp111-112, lines 20-7, Richard Thomas, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-9-December-2011.pdf; pp11-13, paras 30-38, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/First-Witness-Statement-of-Richard-Thomas-CBE.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
 <span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) the course of conduct of the criminal investigations was unsatisfactorily managed, with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the result that opportunities were missed to address potential criminality in the culture,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and ethics of the press;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) insufficient consideration was given to alternative operational strategies, both formal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and informal, for addressing the matter;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) in particular, the failure to give serious contemplation to engaging directly with either</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the data controllers in the press or the data subject victims is difficult to reconcile with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the general duties of the ICO or with a recognisably considered approach to weighing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">up its operational priorities.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-5"><a href="#para5-5" name="para5-5">5.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It also appears that there was insufficient connection between the operational work of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO on the Motorman case and the strategic or political choices made by the Information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner to respond to the issue at a higher level, that is to say, by engaging in dialogue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the PCC and campaigning on s55. As a result, those choices were insufficiently well-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">informed and effective, and not appropriately targeted at the issues about the culture,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and ethics of the press disclosed by the Motorman material.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-6"><a href="#para5-6" name="para5-6">5.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In particular, while it was not unreasonable to think it worth exploring the contribution the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC could make to addressing the problem presented by the Motorman material, the strategy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lacked from the outset:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) clearly-defined objectives and outcomes; putting a stop to the practice, condemnation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Code changes were propositions at too high a level of generality to be capable of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generating a timetable or plan of action measurable in terms of identifiable changes in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the culture, practices and ethics of the press;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) a clear, informed and realistic apprehension of the nature, role and functions of the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the contribution it might be expected to make (which is a point that Mr Thomas</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accepted); it was not satisfactory for the ICO to seek to discharge its own functions to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any extent through an organisation such as the PCC without being very clear about its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ability to take on and deliver that charge satisfactorily, and there is insufficient evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this was properly researched;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) a detailed plan for how the ICO&#8217;s own functions would have to be brought to bear to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">ensure that the two organisations&#8217; contributions would work together to produce the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">desired regulatory outcome;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) a thought-through analysis of how the strategy of trying to engage the PCC on the one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hand, and the political campaign on s55 on the other were likely to interact, particularly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given the personalities involved, and plans for dealing with the potential (which might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be thought obvious) for the objectives of each to conflict.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-7"><a href="#para5-7" name="para5-7">5.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These problems were compounded by persistence in the dialogue with the PCC in a way</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which failed to be sufficiently focused and realistic, proportionate to its likely effect and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effectiveness, failed to keep in view the ICO&#8217;s own role and responsibilities. In particular,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as it became apparent that the response of the PCC was falling short of what ICO hoped,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opportunities were missed to reappraise the strategy which could have been replaced or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">supplemented by the direct exercise of its own powers and functions, including by way of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issuing good practice guidance or otherwise engaging directly with the industry.</span>
 <p id="para-id-5-8"><a href="#para5-8" name="para5-8">5.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both Mr Thomas and, latterly, Mr Graham are to be commended for the extent to which they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have robustly sought, in the face of sustained hostility and lobbying from the press, to make</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the case publicly for better standards and to encourage rational consideration of the merits</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the argument for increasing the sentencing maxima for s55 offences. To the extent that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the s55 campaign can be regarded as a response to the Motorman case (and I recognise that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it had other motivations also), it is arguable that it was problematic in:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) the extent to which it drew the ICO into the contested political arena and away from its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">primary regulatory obligations under the DPA;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) the extent to which it focused exclusively on the criminal law as a potential solution,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and its lack of practical engagement with the limitations on the effectiveness of such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">solutions; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) not identifying the context, either within the wider role and functions of the ICO or in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any plan for realising any benefits that it might have been capable of yielding.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-9"><a href="#para5-9" name="para5-9">5.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the light of the analysis of the response to the Motorman material, it is appropriate to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclude that ICO did not effectively grasp the full implications, and indeed opportunities, of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the case. As a result:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) previous misconduct was inadequately brought to justice and was not otherwise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">addressed as a matter of law enforcement;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) the risk of continuing breaches of law and standards was not effectively addressed;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) the interests of the victims were inadequately protected; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) an important opportunity was missed to address problems in the culture, practices and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethics of the press in relation to the acquisition and use of personal information, which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could have had an impact beyond the facts of the Motorman case.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the circumstances, a real question must remain as to whether these missed opportunities</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contributed, either at a general or a specific level, to later manifestations of disregard for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the rights of others in relation to information privacy which were subsequently exhibited by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">certain parts of the press, of which phone hacking was the most serious.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-10"><a href="#para5-10" name="para5-10">5.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I should make very clear that there is no evidence to suggest, as Mr Owens invited the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to do, that the political campaign and the publication of the<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy?</span> reports were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a deliberate attempt to deflect attention from the ICO&#8217;s operational inactivity. To the extent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that they drew public and political attention to the problem, they did themselves perform</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a function of acting as a warning to others in positions of authority to take action. To that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extent, Mr Graham&#8217;s description of the role of the ICO in the Motorman story (<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> are</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">good guys&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> )</span><span style="font-style:normal"> may</span><span style="font-style:normal"> fairly</span><span style="font-style:normal"> be</span><span style="font-style:normal"> endorsed.</span></span>

<p id="para-id-5-11"><a href="#para5-11" name="para5-11">5.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The principal outstanding questions, therefore, to which the remainder of this Part of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Report is addressed, are these:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) Is there any reason to think that there are still causes for concern about the culture,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and ethics of the press in relation to personal information, whether as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matter of law or as a matter of good practice?</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) To what extent do issues persist about the perception of the ICO that its role and powers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are inadequate or inappropriate to address evidence of any such problems?</span>
 <span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) To what extent, on an objective analysis, are there genuine shortcomings in the legal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">framework, and are there any changes which could be made to improve the situation?</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) Are there any other impediments to the ICO making a more effective contribution</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to supporting law enforcement and good practice in relation to the press which it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary or desirable to remove?</span>
