<h1>CHAPTER 5<br/>ISSUES ABOUT THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. The current views of the ICo</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The account that Mr Graham himself provided of the role, functions and powers of the ICO</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">drew attention to the way in which they had more recently developed:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Information Commissioner&#8217;s role in regulating the use of personal data has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">evolved over the years. The role was originally intended primarily as an educator,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ensuring data protection compliance by promoting good practice. Significant</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enforcement powers of the Commissioner, such as civil monetary penalties, have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been introduced by amendment over the last few years, partly in response to high</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">profile data losses. Section 51 [of the Data Protection Act 1998] sets out the general</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">functions of the Information Commissioner. These are generally about promoting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">good practice rather than punishing poor practice. This educator function is still</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">central to how I approach my role as Information Commissioner.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The power to impose civil monetary penalties of up to half a million pounds was introduced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in April 2010. Mr Graham described it as:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;beginningtohaveaverysalutaryeffect,bothonpublicauthoritiesandoncommercial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">companies. They realise that the Information Commissioner has teeth.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He also explained his view that the way in which the Data Protection Act (DPA) bore on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">presswascomplex;itwasnoteasytoexplaininclearandsimpletermstoindividualswhattheir</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rights were, what the role of the ICO was in enforcing those rights, and what its relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was to other organisations with functions in the area of law enforcement and good practice.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This, in his view, meant that individuals sometimes expected more of the DPA than it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">capable of doing in this area.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> That might be thought likely to suggest two consequences in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular. These are an increased emphasis on the explanatory and educational role of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO which Mr Graham had previously emphasised, and an increased burden on the ICO itself</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to give a clear lead in relation to compliance and good practice by the press, since individuals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were evidently relatively less well placed to proactively enforce their own rights.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The conclusion reached by Mr Graham was different. He put it that, had Parliament intended</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to give the Information Commissioner a significant role in overseeing the use of personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information for journalistic purposes,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> would</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> provided</span><span style="font-style:italic"> him</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> different</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">much simpler legal framework within which to do so&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> He</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> clear</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> ICO</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> never</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intended to play a major role in the regulation of the press and that while the data protection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regime was designed to protect information privacy it was not intended to impinge on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">use of personal information for the purposes of journalism. The enforcement role of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO in this context was intended to be very limited; there was to be no challenge available</span>

<a name="page1062"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">on data protection grounds to the use of personal information for journalism, and certainly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">none prior to publication. The principal effect of the DPA on journalism therefore was in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">application of the criminal offence created by s55.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, Mr Graham&#8217;s more detailed consideration of the scheme of the DPA in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press necessarily qualifies that very general proposition.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> In this, he set out the significant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">restrictions placed by the exemption provisions of s32 on the enforcement powers of the ICO</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to journalists&#8217; use of private information, concluding that therefore the Act largely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">leaves it to individuals to pursue court action after publication if they want to assert their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rights: this is, of course, a problem if the legislation makes it hard for them to understand</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what those rights are.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He also drew attention to the fact that the exemption is made to turn on the reasonable belief</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the journalist that publication would be in the public interest. In considering whether a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalist&#8217;s belief about the public interest is reasonable, the DPA provides that regard may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be had to his or her compliance with any relevant Code which has been designated for that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">purpose by the Secretary of State: the Codes so far designated are the PCC Editors&#8217; Code, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Ofcom Broadcasting Code and the BBC Producers&#8217; Guidelines.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It was Mr Graham&#8217;s view that the role given to journalists&#8217; reasonable belief in the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest meant that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;it is not the Information Commissioner&#8217;s judgment about where the public interest</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">lies or whether the provisions of the Act are compatible with journalism that counts</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and he has limited power to investigate or challenge the [journalist] data controller&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">opinion.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He did accept, however, that the Information Commissioner has powers, albeit &#8216;specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and limited&#8217;, to challenge<span style="font-style:italic"> whether</span> the press exemption is being properly relied on. They are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specific and limited because the DPA inserts a lot of procedural hurdles to their use, including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the restriction that action cannot generally be taken unless the ICO is invited to do so by an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual or a court (irrespective of the fact that individuals may not be well-placed to issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such an invitation). But the powers do confer a function on the ICO of, in effect, policing the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">boundary between proper and improper claims on the journalism exemption:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In essence the investigative and enforcement powers at the Information</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Commissioner&#8217;s disposal exist to enable me to ascertain whether personal data are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">being processed for purposes other than journalism and to act in relation to those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other purposes, rather than enabling me to regulate the actual processing of personal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">data for journalistic purposes.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">To the extent, therefore, that there is any issue that journalists were, for example, seeking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and using personal information for a range of unethical purposes other than with a view to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication, a regulatory question does arise. An example might be to threaten publication for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">collateral purposes or otherwise to put pressure on individuals to act or refrain from acting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in certain ways. That, he recognised, would be expected directly to engage the functions of</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">the ICO.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Graham also acknowledged that ss32 and 55 did not exhaust the application of the DPA</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the press. Quite apart from specific provisions (for example, the express provision that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals have<span style="font-style:italic"> enhanced</span> rights to damages for breaches of the legal requirements of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regime by the press),<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> the general duty of the ICO to promote compliance and good practice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">applies in relation to the press. About that general duty, Mr Graham observed:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I also have a duty under section 51 of the Act to issue guidance and promote good</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">practice. This duty is not specific to the press, journalism or other special purposes. I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">am aware that during my predecessor&#8217;s time in office significant efforts were made</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to provide advice to the PCC in relation to guidance we were encouraging the PCC to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">produce for journalists, focusing on the section 55 offence. So far as I am aware, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">PCC did not go any further than producing general, high level guidance on journalism</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the Act at the time and we have not received any further approaches to discuss</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">such guidance during my time in office.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of course, the general duty to promote compliance and good practice, and the power to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue guidance, is free-standing and not dependent on the receipt of an approach.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-11"><a href="#para1-11" name="para1-11">1.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Graham&#8217;s perspective on the role of the ICO in relation to the press also included an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important acknowledgement that the correct approach to its more specific regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">functions had to be on a case by case basis and not on the basis of generalised assumptions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the exclusion of journalism from the purview of the regime. What Mr Graham said in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this respect is set out in full here because I am content to adopt it for the purposes of this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Report as an accurate and succinct summary of the legal and practical position, and one on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the basis of which the outstanding questions about the detail of the regime in its application</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the press should be considered:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The fact that there is a public interest in a free press being able to go about its</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">businessisreflectedinthetreatmentofthe&#8220;specialpurposes&#8221;undertheAct.However,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it cannot be the case that any and every activity carried out in the name of journalism</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should be regarded as exempt from the provisions of the Act. Indeed, I do not believe</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that that extreme position is seriously advanced by any significant strand of opinion</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">within the journalistic profession. There will, in certain circumstances, always need to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be a judgment around the public interest in particular stories. This point is explicitly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">provided for in the various journalistic codes, for example the PCC Editors&#8217; Code,</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Ofcom Code, BBC Producers&#8217; Guidelines, and so on. This is also the position reflected</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the recitals to the Directive itself. The balance to be struck between Article 8 and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Article 10 of the Human Rights Act 1998 has to be considered on a case by case basis.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The inevitable tension between &#8220;the right to privacy&#8221; and &#8220;freedom of expression&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">demands that the issues at stake in each situation are properly evaluated. I observe</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in passing that making judgments on where the balance of the public interest lies on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the facts of each case is something that the information Commissioner is called upon</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to do under both the Act and the FOIA.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-12"><a href="#para1-12" name="para1-12">1.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The last point is particularly significant. Although it is the journalist&#8217;s honest belief that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or she is working towards a publication in the public interest that counts, a challenge as to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether that belief is a reasonable one in all the circumstances is a matter for the Information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner to consider on a case by case basis, and a matter on which the ICO has a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">general measure of experience and expertise.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref9" name="footnote9" title="Go back to footnote reference 9 in the text">9</a>.  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/section/13</p><!--footnote-->

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In my judgment, on the face of it, a combination of this kind of case by case approach to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO&#8217;s law enforcement function in relation to the press, and the application to the press of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ICO&#8217;s general duties to promote compliance and good practice, do add up to a significant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potential role in guaranteeing public confidence in the culture, practices and ethics of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press in relation to personal information. However, the Inquiry saw little evidence of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">realisation of that potential, or, in practice, of that role having been fulfilled. It was particularly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hard to reconcile this potential with Mr Graham&#8217;s resistance to the suggestion that the ICO</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be actively making a connection between its role and functions and the activities of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press in relation to personal information privacy.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-14"><a href="#para1-14" name="para1-14">1.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In looking for any possible explanation for that within the legal framework itself, the question</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which has to be considered is whether there are features of the current data protection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regime in relation to the press (including perhaps the needless complexity cited by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Information Commissioner himself) which were themselves inhibiting that role and which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are capable of improvement.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. A different perspective on the legal framework</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry was greatly assisted by the evidence of Philip Coppel QC who reflected on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">history and substance of the provisions of the DPA with a particular bearing on journalism.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup> By</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way of introduction, Mr Coppel pointed out that the predecessor legislation to the DPA, that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is to say the Data Protection Act 1984 (which was not the product of a European Directive),</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had no exemption provisions for the press equivalent to those in the modern legislation. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was the EU Data Protection Directive of 1995<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup> which required Member States to introduce</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">measures into domestic law to:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;provide for exemptions or derogations &#8230; for processing personal data carried out</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">solely for journalistic purposes only if they are necessary to reconcile the right to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">privacy with the rules governing freedom of expression&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As Mr Coppel explained, in this way the Directive itself represents the balance that has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">struck in relation to personal information privacy, between the individual right to privacy and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the individual right to freedom of expression found, respectively, in Article 8 and Article 10</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the European Convention on Human Rights (now incorporated into UK law by the Human</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rights Act 1998).</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coppel explained that the Data Protection Act 1998 in turn gives effect to the required</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">balance in three main ways:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;(1) Through the s32 exemption. This relieves a data controller from all obligations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">under the DPA to an individual (and correspondingly removes protection conferred</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">processed for the special purposes to enjoy the s 32 exemption are:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">i. the processing is being undertaken with a view to the publication by any person</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of journalistic, literary or artistic material;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ii. the data controller reasonably believes that, having regard to the special</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">importance of the public interest in freedom of expression, publication would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be in the public interest; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">iii. thedatacontrollerreasonablybelievesthat,inallthecircumstances,compliance</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with the data subject&#8217;s rights is incompatible with the special purposes.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;(2) By the procedural relief conferred by s 32(4)-(5). Proceedings against a data</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">controller must be stayed where the data controller claims that the data are being</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">processed only for the special purposes and with a view to publishing by any person</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of journalistic etc material. The stay remains in place until the Commissioner has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">made a determination under s 45 that the data is not being so processed.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;(3) By creating a special enforcement regime (see &#167;&#167;54-55 above), which largely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">displaces the ordinary enforcement regime.&#8221;</span>
<h4>Civil law enforcement: the exemptions in s32 of the Data Protection Act Legal analysis and suggestions for reform</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first thing to note about s32, as Mr Coppel explained, is the extent to which it disapplies</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the protection for individuals which is effected by the Act itself.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup> Mr Coppel&#8217;s analysis of s32</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">began by highlighting the notable features of the exemption:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;(1) It exempts the data controller from compliance with the great majority of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">obligations under the DPA owed to a data subject &#8230;, rather than just the limited</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">group of obligations termed &#8220;the subject information provisions&#8221; or &#8220;the non-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">disclosure provisions&#8221;. This includes compliance with the data protection principles.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;(2) The processing by the data controller must be both:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; &#8220;only for the special purposes&#8221;; and</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; with a view to the publication by any person (i.e. not just the data controller)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of any journalistic, literary or artistic material (i.e. it need not be the data being</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">processed nor need it be related to the data being processed).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;(3) The second and third limbs needed to engage the exemption turn on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reasonable belief of the data controller, rather than on fact. The only matter</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">identified by the section as inform that belief when assessing its reasonableness</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are various press codes of conduct, prepared by the press.&#8221;</span>

<a name="page1066"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The s 32 exemption originated as clause 31 in the Data Protection Bill. In giving</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Bill its second reading speech in the House of Lords, Lord Williams of Mostyn</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recorded the paramountcy which the clause was intended to give to freedom of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expression:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Government believe that both privacy and freedom of expression</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are important rights and that the directive is not intended to alter the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">balance...&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">This view was endorsed by Lord Wakeham, chairman of the Press Complaints</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Commission, who commended the Bill for:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...steer[ing] a sensible path which avoids the perils of a privacy law and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">achieves the crucial balancing act - of privacy and freedom of expression</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">- in a clever and constructive way....The Data Protection Bill does not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">introduce a back-door privacy regime. The Human Rights Bill does. The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Data Protection Bill safeguards the position of effective self-regulation.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Human Rights Bill may end up undermining it.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Solicitor-General (Lord Falconer of Thoroton) then endorsed Lord Wakeham&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">view:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;No one could have expressed the arguments in favour [of cl 31] more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">eloquently.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;Disquiet was expressed in the House by others:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; that, as a result of cl 31, the Bill failed to protect privacy,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; that cl 31 was too wide and significantly undermined the function of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the legislation, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; that the notion of the public interest was too wide and vague a basis</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">upon which to disapply the protection conferred by the Bill.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Amendments were unsuccessfully introduced to address these misgivings. In</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">supporting the amendments, Lord Lester of Herne Hill warned at length that,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as drafted and because of cl 31, the DPA failed to implement the Directive and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">authorised interference by the press with the right to privacy in breach of Art 8 of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">the ECHR.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The authorities</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Judicial pronouncements have acknowledged that the DPA is concerned with the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">protection of an individual&#8217;s ECHR rights to privacy.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The principal judicial authority on the s 32 exemption is the Court of Appeal&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">judgment in Campbell v MGN Ltd. The claimant had claimed against a newspaper</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for its having published articles which disclosed details of the therapy the claimant</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was receiving for her drug addiction. These included covertly taken photographs of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">her leaving a therapy group meeting. The claimant alleged that these amounted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to a breach of confidence (based on her right to privacy under ECHR arts 8 and 10)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and a breach of the data protection principles (entitling her to claim a breach of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">s 4(4) DPA statutory duty).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In the High Court, judgment was entered for the claimant on both claims. In</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relation to the DPA claim, the newspaper agreed that publishing the articles it had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">processed sensitive personal data relating to the claimant. The court held: &#8211;</span>
<a name="page1067"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">thatthepublishedinformation(i.e.thenatureanddetailsofhertherapy)constituted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sensitive personal data relating to the claimant;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that that was not lawful since it constituted a breach of confidence;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that that processing was not fair as the information was acquired surreptitiously;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that that processing did not satisfy any of the conditions in Schedule 2;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that that processing did not satisfy any of the conditions in Schedule 3; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">thattheexemptionins32onlyappliedtoprocessingout&#8220;withaviewtopublication&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and not to the processing involved in the publication itself.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The court assessed damages at &#163;2,500 and aggravated damages at &#163;1,000.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Court of Appeal allowed the newspaper&#8217;s appeal on both the confidentiality</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">claim and the DPA claim. The Court of Appeal accepted that &#8220;processing&#8221; included</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">publication in print. However, the Court, reversing the High Court, extended</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the duration of s 32 exemption to cover processing on and after publication.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">This division between processing before and after publication had limited s 32&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">disapplication of the DPA&#8217;s protection up until, but not including, the most invasive</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">activity - publication. In construing the section to give press freedom paramountcy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">throughout and with no opportunity to balance the individual&#8217;s interest in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">maintaining privacy, the judgment renders the DPA unlikely to be compliant with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Directive.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The claimant appealed to the House of Lords. The claimant put the breach of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">confidence claim at the forefront of the appeal, with the parties agreeing that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">DPA claim &#8220;stands or falls with the outcome of the main claim&#8221; and that it &#8220;add[ed]</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nothing to the claim for breach of confidence.&#8221; In this way, protection of privacy in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">personal information came to be secured through the adaptation of the action for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">breach of confidence. In so doing, the House of Lords absorbed into the action the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">competition between freedom of expression as protected by Art 10 and respect for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an individual&#8217;s privacy as protected by Art 8 &#8211; the very balancing exercise which the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Directive articulates and which the DPA is supposed to implement.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;On one analysis, the House of Lord&#8217;s judgment appears to leave untouched the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Court of Appeal&#8217;s treatment of the DPA. This would be unfortunate. The misgivings</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which had been expressed in Parliament during the passage of the Bill (see above)</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">materialised with the Court of Appeal&#8217;s judgment. The better analysis is that,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">given the parties&#8217; agreement that the DPA claim stood or fell with the breach of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">confidence claim, the latter&#8217;s success means that the DPA claim enjoyed equal, if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">unspoken, success in the House of Lords.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Personal privacy protection since Campbell v MGN</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The practical effect of the Campbell litigation has been that breach of privacy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">claims are now principally brought under the HRA, rather than under the DPA. This</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is borne out by the treatment of privacy in the main media law practitioner text,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which recognises that the DPA:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 12px;">&#8220;<span style="font-size: 15px;"> contains</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> the</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> most</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> comprehensive</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> privacy</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> provisions</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> now</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> affecting</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">media&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but goes on to comment that &#8220;misuse of private information&#8221; (i.e. the evolved</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">breach of confidence action):</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...will be of most relevance in the majority of privacy cases involving the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">media&#8221;</span>
<a name="page1068"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">and that:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;..the other [action], much less significant in practice, is reliance on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">statutory rights such as those afforded by the Data Protection Act 1998.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The explanation offered for this is that:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Data protection law is technical and unfamiliar to most judges. Claims under this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">legislation will rarely offer tangible advantages over a claim for breach of confidence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or misuse of private information. Given the paucity of current authority on how the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Data Protection Act 1998 is to be interpreted and applied, applications for summary</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">judgment on such claims are &#8217;for the moment at least, unlikely to find favour.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Given that the stated objective of the Directive was to protect personal privacy in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information in a way which reconciled Arts 8 and 10 of the ECHR, this practical result</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">suggests a shortfall in the implementation of the Directive.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coppel concluded by summarising the current position with the following propositions:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) &#8220;The DPA provides a code to protect the privacy of an individual&#8217;s personal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information, in whatever form recorded other than in ad hoc manual records.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) The protection required by the Directive and provided by the DPA begins from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the moment a person handling personal information acquires it and only ends</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">once that person no longer holds it.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) The Directive &#8211; to which the DPA is intended to give effect &#8211; permits Member</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">States to relieve the press of obligations otherwise applicable to the processing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of personal information where that it required to reconcile the ECHR right of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">privacy with the ECHR right to freedom of expression.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(d) Freedofjudge-madeauthority,theDPAprovidesanindividual withameasureof</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">protection against press invasions of personal information privacy, but, because</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the s 32 exemption does not provide for any balancing of the fundamental right</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to privacy against the fundamental right to freedom of expression, the measure</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of protection is less than that provided under Art 8 of the ECHR.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(e) The DPA, in articulating:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">i.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">degrees of sensitivity of personal information;</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">ii.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the uses of that information against which protection is provided;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">iii. the purposes for which those uses will be relieved of obligations securing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the protection,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">iv. andinadjustingtheprotectionaccordingthesensitivityoftheinformation,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">offers a sophistication and predictability which is unmatched by the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">jurisprudence on ECHR-based privacy claims.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(f) In reported practice, press invasions of an individual&#8217;s personal information</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">privacy have mostly been remedied through ECHR-based privacy claims.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(g) Judge-made law has substantially reduced the efficacy of the DPA as a means</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of remedying press invasions of an individual&#8217;s personal information privacy,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">possibly to the point that the DPA, so construed, no longer gives full effect to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Directive.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The result, in Mr Coppel&#8217;s view, is that where journalism is concerned:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;undoubtedly, once you&#8217;re in section 32 territory, then the protection which is given to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an individual&#8217;s privacy almost entirely falls away. All you have to do is touch section</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">32 in some way, shape or form and the contest which the Act is supposed to embody</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">between the right of expression, freedom of [expression], and an individual&#8217;s personal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">privacy has all been tilted one way.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In other words, the journalist is made arbiter of the balance, and the balance in turn falls to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be made on the basis of matters exclusively within the knowledge of the journalist, including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matters inaccessible because of the extensive protection provided for journalists&#8217; sources. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">goes on to argue that s32:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;does not recognise any right to privacy. It&#8217;s there, its sole objective is to cut away</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at the right of privacy, and at the end of it, certainly after the decisions of the court,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there is nothing left of that right.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In practical terms, the argument goes, the approach of the courts to the substantive law,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">coupled with the procedural inhibitions provided in other parts of the DPA (considered below)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">together with the very low level of damages which the courts have awarded have, between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them, atrophied the principles and individual rights in their practical application to the press.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">Asamatteroflaw,thereismorethanonewaytoreflectonthetenorofMrCoppel&#8217;sarguments.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Put at its highest, his case would be that on the current state of the UK authorities, s32 fails to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">implement the Directive from which it derives, and is inconsistent with the relevant parts of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ECHR to which it is intended to give effect, because the relationship between privacy and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expression rights has got out of balance. A proper balance is a fundamental obligation. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">UK is therefore positively<span style="font-style:italic"> required</span> to change the law to restore the balance. That is indeed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coppel&#8217;s own contention: that UK data protection law currently fails to implement our</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obligations, and that Lord Lester&#8217;s concerns had proved to be prescient.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Without going so far as that, even if the current balance were within the spectrum permitted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by our international obligations, the argument could be expressed in terms that it is at an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extreme end of that spectrum, and the UK can as a matter of law, and should as a matter of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">policy, restore a more even-handed approach, not least given the asymmetry of risks and</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">harms as between the individual and the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-12"><a href="#para2-12" name="para2-12">2.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Put at its very lowest, the point could be made that the effect of the development of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case law has been to push personal privacy law in media cases out of the data protection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regime and into the more open seas of the Human Rights Act. This has happened for no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">better reason than the slowness of the legal profession to assimilate data protection law and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the case of the judiciary, its greater familiarity with (and, he suggests, perhaps a preference</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for) the latitude afforded by the human rights regime over the specificity of data protection.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">But this, the argument goes, is undesirable because the data protection regime is much</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more predictable, detailed and sophisticated in the way it protects and balances rights, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significantly reduces the risks, uncertainties and expense of litigation concomitant on more</span>

<a name="page1070"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">answers, the fine-nibbed pen should be grasped and not the broad brush. The balancing of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">competing rights in a free democracy is a highly sophisticated exercise; appropriate tools</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been provided for the job and should be used.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coppel suggested that the opportunity should be taken to redraft s32 in order better to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reflect the balance between freedom of expression and the protection of privacy envisaged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both in the Directive and in the ECHR. He suggested two changes in particular. The first is to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">modify the test for reliance on s32 so that it will be available only where:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) &#8220;the acquisition or use of the information is necessary for publication rather</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">than simply being in fact undertaken with a view to publication;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) &#8220;there is a reasonable belief that publication would be in the public interest,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">withnospecialweightingofthebalancebetweenthepublicinterestinfreedom</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of information and in privacy; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) &#8220;objectively, that the likely interference with privacy is outweighed by the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public interest in freedom of information.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-14"><a href="#para2-14" name="para2-14">2.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second change is to amend s32 so that it gives exemption from fewer rights and principles,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and in particular no longer allows for exemption from:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) &#8220;the requirement to obtain and use information in accordance with statute</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">law;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) &#8220;the requirement to obtain the information only for specific purposes and not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to use it in any way incompatible with those purposes;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) &#8220;the requirement for information to be accurate and up to date;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(d) &#8220;the rights of individuals under the Act; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(e) &#8220;restrictions on exporting the information.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coppel provided the Inquiry with an illustrative revised version of s32 to indicate the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sort of changes which would need to be made.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup> I should make it clear at once that I do not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">express any view on the drafting suggestions that Mr Coppel makes, nor is it appropriate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for this Report to frame recommendations in the form of draft legislation. For that reason,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Report&#8217;s consideration is strictly limited to the policy objectives underlying Mr Coppel&#8217;s</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggestions which are not simply to be inferred from the drafting but as explained by Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Coppel in his evidence; it would of course be a matter for Parliamentary Counsel in due</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">course to reflect on how any policy recommendations of this nature would best be captured</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in drafting terms.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-16"><a href="#para2-16" name="para2-16">2.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Considered purely in terms of what it might be desirable to achieve in terms of outcomes by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any changes in the law, the underlying rationale of Mr Coppel&#8217;s analysis and conclusions can</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be stated relatively simply. Firstly, it is to express more clearly the even-handed approach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">required by human rights law to the balance between individual civil liberties on the one hand,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the public interest in the liberties of the press on the other. Secondly, it is to improve the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prospects of law enforcement and the restoration of that balance where the press goes too</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">far in transgressing individual civil liberties.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-17"><a href="#para2-17" name="para2-17">2.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The suggested reforms would seek to achieve these objectives by focusing the mind of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalist much more explicitly on the balanced judgment he or she has to make in the first</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">place, with a reminder that the journalist is not above the law, and cannot be the sole arbiter</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref23" name="footnote23" title="Go back to footnote reference 23 in the text">23</a>.  http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Submission-by-Philip-Coppel-QC-redacted.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1071"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">in the end of whether the public has been well-served by his or her actions. In other words,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the changes are designed to promote conscious awareness in journalism and accountability</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the public. Furthermore, they are intended to do so without imposing any burdens on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">honest and reasonably conscientious journalism<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup> beyond what is practicable and workable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a matter of day to day practice. The question is whether these intentions, from which it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hard to dissent, were indeed likely to be achievable along the lines Mr Coppel was proposing.</span>
<h4>News International&#8217;s objections to Mr Coppel&#8217;s proposals</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-18"><a href="#para2-18" name="para2-18">2.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News International (NI) made submissions to the Inquiry to the effect that what Mr Coppel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggested was misconceived.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup> This part of the Report considers these objections in turn.</span>
<h4>(a) The &#8216;fundamental objection&#8217;</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-19"><a href="#para2-19" name="para2-19">2.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the first place, NI raised what it described as a &#8216;fundamental objection&#8217;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup> This relates to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposed narrowing of the exemption in s32 on the basis of its divergence from the broad</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interpretation given to s32 by the Court of Appeal in<span style="font-style:italic"> Campbell</span><span style="font-style:italic"> v</span><span style="font-style:italic"> MGN</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Ltd.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup> It was further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argued that the effect of<span style="font-style:italic"> Campbell</span> is that the existing provisions of s32, provided they are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">widely interpreted, strike the appropriate balance between Article 8 and Article 10.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-20"><a href="#para2-20" name="para2-20">2.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As a matter of law, I do not see that this concern constitutes a &#8216;fundamental objection&#8217; to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the policy. Mr Coppel&#8217;s submission is precisely that<span style="font-style:italic"> Campbell,</span> in its interpretation of s32,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unduly widened an already excessively wide s32 as enacted in the DPA 1998. His argument</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is that the current s32 is framed in a way that effectively means journalism nearly always</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">trumps privacy and therefore fails properly to implement the Directive. On that basis, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">narrowing of the s32 exemption is better understood as returning s32 to its intended remit.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is of course open to Parliament to amend the wording of the exemption in s32 irrespective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the terms of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in<span style="font-style:italic"> Campbell,</span> provided that any amended</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">s32 does not conflict with the underlying Directive to which it is intended to give effect, nor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is incompatible with Article 10 or other provisions of EU law. The issue is not whether the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">policy of the proposed amendments conflict with<span style="font-style:italic"> Campbell</span> , but whether they are necessarily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">incompatible with Article 10.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-21"><a href="#para2-21" name="para2-21">2.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not apparent to me that there is a necessary incompatibility, or that s32 as currently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">drafted is the least generous formulation from journalism&#8217;s point of view which is conceivably</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consistent with the ECHR if, indeed, it is consistent at all. Article 10 is a qualified right,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inherently requiring a balance with other rights (including the right to privacy). I do not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consider that<span style="font-style:italic"> Campbell</span> can be read in the way that NI appears to contend, namely that a wide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interpretation of s32 is<span style="font-style:italic"> necessarily</span> required to give effect to Article 10 and that any narrowing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the scope of s32(1) is<span style="font-style:italic"> necessarily</span> incompatible with Article 10. It must be remembered that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the wide construction in<span style="font-style:italic"> Campbell</span> concerned the temporal element of the exemption, i.e.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether it was confined to pre-publication activity or included publication itself.<span style="font-style:italic"> Campbell</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">itself is entirely silent on the need to strike a balance between privacy and Article 10.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-22"><a href="#para2-22" name="para2-22">2.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is argued by NI that the proposed replacement of the test of processing &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> undertaken</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a view to publication&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> ,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> with</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span><span style="font-style:normal"> test</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> processing</span> &#8220;necessary for the publication&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> would</span><span style="font-style:normal"> be</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inconsistent with authority and unworkable in practice. NI makes the point that it is self-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evident that for the s32 exemption to work it must cover, as it does at present, the processing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of information which a journalist or editor ultimately decides to leave out of a published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">article.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup> This point was, in fact, squarely addressed by Mr Coppel in oral evidence to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup> The exchange between Counsel to the Inquiry and Mr Coppel went like this:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. &#8220;Can we just look at a paradigm case of investigative journalism, that there&#8217;s a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">lot of preparatory work &#8230; before publication. If the journalist can show that all the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">work is necessary for the publication, then he or she is protected both in relation to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the preparatory work and to the publication itself.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">A. &#8220;Correct.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. &#8220;Is that the correct analysis?&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. &#8220;It recognises that particularly for investigative journalism, in which there may be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a long trail leading up to the publication itself &#8211; and some of those sub-trails may turn</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">out to be fruitless in themselves but are nevertheless necessary in order to explore all</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the avenues to produce the article itself. That will be captured by my proposed 32(1)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">paragraph (a).&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-23"><a href="#para2-23" name="para2-23">2.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The policy intention here would be to tighten the nexus, or causal link, which the legislation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requires between the acquisition and handling of the personal information and the ultimate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication but certainly not to the (obviously unworkable) extent that the exemption would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apply only to material actually published. The idea would be to protect bona fide research or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigatory work without which publication could not happen, and that would have to apply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the point of view of the work at the time and not with hindsight. But it would not protect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dealing in personal information unless it was properly necessary for research and publication.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I do not see that that policy aim is either legally repugnant or necessarily unachievable in law</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and practice. As currently drafted, s32 of the Act requires the Court (or Commissioner) to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consider whether the processing is undertaken with a view to publication, and that requires</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Court (or the Commissioner) to consider the link between the processing and its ultimate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">purpose and the publication. Exactly the same conceptual process would be required under</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coppel&#8217;s proposals, but more would be being asked of the journalist to demonstrate the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary link.</span>
<h4>(c) Replacing the requirement in s32(1)(b) to have particular regard to the &#8216;special importance of the public interest in the freedom of expression&#8217; with a more neutral balance, and an explicit balancing test</h4>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The NI submission<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup> suggests that this would be inconsistent both with Article 10 and s12(4)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Human Rights Act. Dealing with the latter point first, I do not think that there is any</span>

<a name="page1073"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">directing a court when proceedings before it concern journalistic material to have particular</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regard to the importance of freedom of expression. In the event that a DPA claim engaging</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">s12(4) were before the court, it would operate as a free standing provision and there is no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">need for the further incorporation of an equivalent provision in s32 in order to give effect to it.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Where there are no proceedings before a court, for example where a journalist is considering</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether s32 is met, s12(4) has no direct application.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-25"><a href="#para2-25" name="para2-25">2.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It may be asked whether the recognition given in s12(4) to the importance of freedom of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expression is not a reflection of the more fundamental point in the NI submission, namely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that as a matter of ECHR law there is in fact special importance attached to freedom of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expression, and beyond that to a lack of constraint on journalism, to which the removal of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">formulation in s32 is repugnant. Undoubtedly, there is a very special public interest in freedom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of expression, as formulated in Article 10. But it certainly puts the argument very high to say</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the existing language of s32 is a minimum imperative required by the ECHR. Indeed, as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is apparent, during the passage of the Data Protection Bill, some anxiety was expressed by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expert opinion in Parliament to the effect that the pull it exerted on the scales balancing the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest in freedom of expression as against other public interests (including privacy)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was itself not compatible with the language of the Convention.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-26"><a href="#para2-26" name="para2-26">2.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I do not consider, as the NI submission seems to suggest, that the current drafting of s32</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can be held up as the only and immutable expression of the balance between personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information privacy and the value in a free society of journalistic (or artistic or literary)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">endeavour. An expression of that balance in UK data protection law, which occupies a more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">central zone of the margin of appreciation, and which is expressed in language more close</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to that of Articles 8 and 10 themselves and which encourages those exercising precious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">freedoms to be mindful in doing so of other people&#8217;s precious freedoms is something which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it seems to me to be both possible and desirable to achieve. None of the provisions of s32 at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">present contains any explicit recognition of the wider context of public interest within which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalism must fairly operate. Mr Coppel&#8217;s suggestion of introducing an explicit balancing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">test seems to me to be both truer to the letter and spirit of the Convention, and an important</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and necessary encouragement to mindfulness where journalism handles, as it often must,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private information.</span>

<h4>(d) Taking individual subject access rights out of the automatic exemption provision</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-27"><a href="#para2-27" name="para2-27">2.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The NI submission describes this as<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;perhaps</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> most</span><span style="font-style:italic"> worrying</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Coppel&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> proposals&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The right of individuals to know what information is held about them is of course at the heart</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the data protection regime, and a very fundamental privacy entitlement in its own right.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">But its application in the modern world of journalism would be a change of some significance,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and it is right that the idea should be considered with great care. The NI submission makes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a number of points about the idea, some of which certainly need to be taken very seriously.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-28"><a href="#para2-28" name="para2-28">2.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is, for example, argued that it would seriously undermine the protection of sources.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Journalists&#8217; sources enjoy a considerable degree of legal protection, not least under Article</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">10 of the Convention.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup> Any change to that protection would have to be considered most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">carefully, and in its own right rather than simply as the by-product of another policy. Sources</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(although not in a way specifically addressed to journalism) are, however, given considerable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">general protection by the data protection regime. That is because where access to one&#8217;s own</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">data would necessarily involve the disclosure of information about a third party (including a</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref31" name="footnote31" title="Go back to footnote reference 31 in the text">31</a>.  page 6-8, <em>ibid</em></p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref32" name="footnote32" title="Go back to footnote reference 32 in the text">32</a>.  Appendix 4</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1074"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">source), the privacy entitlements of that third party have to be respected as well as one&#8217;s own.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In conferring the right of access to one&#8217;s own information, s7 of the existing DPA, therefore,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">makes this further specific provision:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;(4) Where a data controller cannot comply with the request without disclosing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">informationrelatingtoanotherindividualwhocanbeidentifiedfromthatinformation,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he is not obliged to comply with the request unless&#8212;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) the other individual has consented to the disclosure of the information to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">person making the request, or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) it is reasonable in all the circumstances to comply with the request without the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consent of the other individual.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(5) In subsection (4) the reference to information relating to another individual</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">includes a reference to information identifying that individual as the source of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information sought by the request; and that subsection is not to be construed as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">excusing a data controller from communicating so much of the information sought</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by the request as can be communicated without disclosing the identity of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other individual concerned, whether by the omission of names or other identifying</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">particulars or otherwise.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(6) In determining for the purposes of subsection (4)(b) whether it is reasonable in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">all the circumstances to comply with the request without the consent of the other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">individual concerned, regard shall be had, in particular, to&#8212;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a any duty of confidentiality owed to the other individual,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) any steps taken by the data controller with a view to seeking the consent of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the other individual,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) whether the other individual is capable of giving consent, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(d) any express refusal of consent by the other individual.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-29"><a href="#para2-29" name="para2-29">2.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is an important, if technical, point to note that the subject access right is a compound</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">right, including not just a right of access to the information, but a right to know whether</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information is held at all<span style="font-style:normal"> about</span><span style="font-style:normal"> one.</span><span style="font-style:normal"> So</span><span style="font-style:normal"> if</span><span style="font-style:normal"> even</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> confirm</span><span style="font-style:normal"> whether</span><span style="font-style:normal"> information</span><span style="font-style:normal"> is</span><span style="font-style:normal"> held</span><span style="font-style:normal"> would</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disclose a source, s7 makes provision for an answer which will neither confirm nor deny it.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-30"><a href="#para2-30" name="para2-30">2.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I do not express a concluded view as to whether the existing provisions of the DPA are a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complete answer to the challenge that introducing at least the possibility of a right of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subject access has to be reconciled with the need to protect journalists&#8217; sources. I simply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">observe that it is not apparent to me that the importance of protecting journalists&#8217; sources</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cannot be captured in suitable amendment to these provisions, should any be needed. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more fundamental point is that there does not seem to me to be an argument from first</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principles that the protection of journalists&#8217; sources necessitates a complete and blanket</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dis-application of the subject access right in all circumstances. And if it is not necessary to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disapply a fundamental privacy right in all circumstances, it is necessary not to.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-31"><a href="#para2-31" name="para2-31">2.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is further argued by NI that there are other reasons why it would be necessary to take a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">blanket approach to this right in the world of journalism. These are:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) &#8220;the need for legitimate investigative journalism to be able to operate covertly,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and over a period of time, without the object of the investigations being able</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to find out that the press are interested in them;</span>
<a name="page1075"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) &#8220;the burden on newspapers&#8217; resources, particularly given the motivation of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">individuals to find out what is being held about them at regular intervals;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) &#8220;&#8216;it would spell the end of the exclusive&#8217; if individuals could get hold of a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">possible story and provide it on their own terms to another newspaper &#8211; or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">indeed take to the internet with their own pre-emptive version; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(d) &#8220;that it fails to respect the balance required between Article 10 and 8 more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">generally.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-32"><a href="#para2-32" name="para2-32">2.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Care must be taken in this context to avoid rhetorical elision between matters of commercial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">convenience or profit, on the one hand, and a challenge to the current business model of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers so fundamental as to amount to an abridgement of free speech, on the other.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">With the first of the four points noted above, it is possible to readily to agree. With the second</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and third, there are issues of degree. With the third in particular in relation to the question</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of exclusive stories, the business model may well be under rather more acute threat from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">internet generally and the highly ephemeral nature of exclusivity once any publication takes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">place, than from any legislative change relating to the entitlement of individuals to know</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether information is held about them. Similarly, the issue is to a degree less concerned with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the exercise of freedom of expression than with the abridgement of the rights of others to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">receive and impart information. In reality, the key question, therefore, is the fourth, of which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the first is an aspect. Does a fair balance between Articles 10 and 8 prohibit any possibility of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subject access to journalistic material in all circumstances?</span>

<p id="para-id-2-33"><a href="#para2-33" name="para2-33">2.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am not persuaded that it does. It is evident that a fair balance would require an entitlement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for a subject access request to be refused to any degree where to comply with it would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compromise the protections envisaged by Article 10. But I am inclined to think that this could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">properly be done on a case by case basis rather than by wholesale ouster of the right. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">point needs to be borne in mind: a significant aspect of the importance of the subject access</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">right lies in the ability it gives individuals to test for themselves whether their information is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being dealt with lawfully and in accordance with the data protection regime (including, of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">course, whether the information is accurate). That includes being able to test whether any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exemptions are being properly claimed (although not to the extent that properly claimed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exemptions are themselves thereby compromised). The complete exclusion of subject access</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from all journalistic activity removes a principal check on its lawfulness. Who then is to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">perform that function? The obvious answer would be the Information Commissioner, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that answer in itself takes us to a second area which Mr Coppel has identified as problematic.</span>

<h3>Civil law enforcement: journalism, access to justice and the powers of the Information Commissioner</h3>


<p id="para-id-2-34"><a href="#para2-34" name="para2-34">2.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As well as the substantive exemptions provided by s32, the DPA creates a number of special</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">procedural provisions which apply whenever it is claimed that personal information is being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acquired or used for journalism. Their effects are both very significant for the purposes of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry and also very complicated. Their very complexity adds to their impact. It is necessary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to engage with and unravel the detail of these provisions in order properly to understand and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">address their effect.</span>
<a name="page1076"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-2-35"><a href="#para2-35" name="para2-35">2.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The relevant provisions are identified in this way by Mr Coppel:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Once a data controller claims that the personal data are being processed for a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;special purpose&#8221; (i.e. journalism, artistic or literary purposes) or with a view to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">publication by any person of any journalistic, literary or artistic material:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) the Commissioner cannot ordinarily serve an enforcement notice or an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information notice (s 46); and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) where a person has brought a claim under the DPA seeking a remedy for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">breach of any of the data subject&#8217;s rights (see &#167;&#167;37-45 above), the Court must</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">stay the proceedings until there has been a determination under s 45 of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">data controller&#8217;s claim (s 32(4)).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Where the proceedings are so stayed or the Commissioner has received a s 42 request</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for assessment, he may serve a &#8220;special information notice&#8221; (s 44). The object of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">notice is to enable the Commissioner to carry out the s 45 determination. A data</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">controller has a right of appeal against a special information notice (s 48).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Under s 45(1), where it appears to the Commissioner that the personal data are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not being processed only for a special purpose or are not being processed with a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">view to the publication by any person of any journalistic, literary or artistic material,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Commissioner may make a determination to that effect. A data controller has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a right of appeal against the determination. Once the determination takes effect,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Commissioner may serve an information notice. And, if a court gives leave,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Commissioner may serve an enforcement notice. If the Commissioner decides</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">otherwise, proceedings for breach of the DPA may be stayed indefinitely&#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-36"><a href="#para2-36" name="para2-36">2.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Broadly speaking then, the Information Commissioner cannot exercise his regulatory powers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to the press (and a court cannot decide an action brought by an individual for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breach by the press of the rights contained within the data protection regime) unless the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Information Commissioner has first made a formal determination that the newspaper is not,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to given personal information, using it wholly for the purposes of journalism. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only power he can use to help him make that determination is the power to issue a &#8216;special</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information notice&#8217; for the purpose. And he cannot issue one of those unless either litigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is already on foot or he receives a specific request from a complainant. Where he does issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a special information notice, the newspaper can appeal it. And if he does finally make a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;determination&#8217; the newspaper can appeal that too. Any enforcement steps he is then able to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">take, whether investigative or compliance, each brings its own appeal rights.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-37"><a href="#para2-37" name="para2-37">2.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coppel explained some of the cumulative practical impact of these provisions:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It results in a disapplication of the power to serve an enforcement notice &#8211; that&#8217;s the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">first important thing that it does &#8211; and then secondly, where an individual has brought</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a claim, a section 4(4) claim for breach of statutory duty through the DPA, then the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">court must stay those proceedings until there has been a determination under section</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">45, and section 45 is a special procedure relating to the so-called special purposes, ie</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalism, literature and art, to see whether in fact that is the case.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have lost interest in living by then] and particularly if one realises that at the end of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it all one is going to get like, for example, Catherine eta Jones, &#163;50, one can well</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">understand why interest might be a little bit diminished.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-38"><a href="#para2-38" name="para2-38">2.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">During the course of the Inquiry, it has frequently been asserted that most or all of the evident</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">problems with the culture, practices and ethics of the press would be solved if the existing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">law were to be properly enforced. Where press compliance with the legal requirements of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the data protection regime is concerned, enforcing the civil law is a two-stage process. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">must first ensure that the boundary between exempt and non-exempt activity in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to dealings in personal information is properly observed by the press, and this is a point</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which applies wherever that boundary is drawn by the substantive law. Secondly, it must also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ensure proper compliance with the regime where exemptions do not apply.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-39"><a href="#para2-39" name="para2-39">2.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Law enforcement in these respects takes place in two different ways. First, it is by individuals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bringing cases in the courts, and, secondly, by the exercise of his powers by the Information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner. Both as regards litigation procedure on the one hand and as regards the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assertion of the powers of public authorities on the other, there are already significant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inhibitions in the general law which impact on the possibility of proper law enforcement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in respect of the press because of the balance which must be struck between the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest in law enforcement and the public interest in the protection of journalists&#8217; sources.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The additional procedural thicket which the DPA erects in the way of anyone attempting to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">find out whether the press is complying with the law, that is to say whether their activities</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are genuinely covered by exemptions and if not whether they are complying with what is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legally required of them, is for practical purposes near-insuperable. The press, so this analysis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">goes, is effectively beyond the reach of law enforcement. In that regard, the legal regime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can be and is disregarded for any practical purposes. Whether what the press are doing with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">people&#8217;s information is or is not specifically exempted from the regime hardly matters in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice since the question is effectively prevented from arising.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-40"><a href="#para2-40" name="para2-40">2.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coppel suggested that this aspect of the problem should be addressed in two ways, that is</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">tosaybyremovingtheelaboratetangleofredtapewhichstopstheInformationCommissioner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">doing his job in relation to the press, and by providing more straightforward access to justice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for individuals.</span>
<h4>Powers of the Information Commissioner</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-41"><a href="#para2-41" name="para2-41">2.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Here, Mr Coppel&#8217;s proposal is very straightforward: the DPA should be amended to repeal the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">entirety of the complex special regime limiting the Information Commissioner&#8217;s powers in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to the press. Specifically, he recommends:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;removing the provisions for special information notices (s 44), special purpose</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">determinations (s 45) and special purposes restrictions (s 46), thereby aligning the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">DPA&#8217;s enforcement procedures as they apply to the press with those that apply to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">others, i.e. the ordinary provisions for enforcement (s 40), assessment (s 42) and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information notices (s 43)&#8221;.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref35" name="footnote35" title="Go back to footnote reference 35 in the text">35</a>.  p18, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Submission-by-Philip-Coppel-QC-redacted.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1078"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-2-42"><a href="#para2-42" name="para2-42">2.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These provisions of the DPA are highly redolent of a policy context in which the self-interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press was a powerful advocate, rather than one in which law enforcement was an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">active concern. Given the specificity and elaborate nature of the provision made for testing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the compliance of the press with the law, however, this much can be said: it cannot have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been the intention of the legislation that the compliance of the press with the law should, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reality, be incapable of being tested in practice. No doubt concerns were vocally expressed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that legitimate journalism should be able to go about its business without interference or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;chill&#8217; from overzealous regulators or nuisance litigation. But there is no policy intention on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the face of the legislation that it should be impossible, in the usual ways, to establish whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the journalism was in fact legitimate in the first place. Such an intention would have been very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">simple to express legislatively although it would, of course, have been incompatible with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">spirit and letter of the Directive. However wide the boundaries of an exemption are set, those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">boundaries have to be given some real meaning. Making those boundaries inaccessible, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the question on which side of them any activity falls effectively incapable of being answered,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strips those boundaries of meaning.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-43"><a href="#para2-43" name="para2-43">2.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The risks of applying the ordinary regime of information and enforcement notices to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press are capable of being overstated. An information notice could not be issued unless the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner reasonably required any information for the purposes of determining whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press were complying with the law. Similarly, an enforcement notice could not be issued</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unless the Commissioner was satisfied that the press had contravened or was contravening</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the law. In each case, the Commissioner would have to bear in mind any genuine risk to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">freedom of expression. Each measure, if deployed, has an appeal mechanism through which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its compatibility with freedom of expression could readily be tested, case by case. It is not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">my view that the mere existence of the possibility of law enforcement measures of this sort</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would itself be an improper inhibition to journalistic activity, nor that the press would be slow</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to understand and make use of the sort of procedural safeguards which the standard data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protection regime provides.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-44"><a href="#para2-44" name="para2-44">2.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">None of this is of course intended to give any encouragement to the idea of over-zealous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reliance by the ICO on formal powers. As successive Information Commissioners have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">repeatedly emphasised, in general, the first recourse of a regulator with concerns about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compliance should always be to seek to resolve matters informally and cooperatively. But</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it has not been my perspective that over-zealous recourse to formal powers has been a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">major concern about the way in which the ICO has engaged with the press and there are, in</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">any event, plenty of inhibitions in law and practice to any such tendency. On the contrary,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it appears that the most pressing concern is the need to address the extent to which the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO is shy about performing its proper role in relation to the press as a member of its field</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of regulation, not least by addressing the evident cultural inhibitions to doing so created</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the DPA&#8217;s complicated procedural regime. If the ICO has entertained a view that it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">somehow unable to apply the law to the press, that it is not really supposed to do so, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">process provisions are likely to have been a significant encouragement to that view, however</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">overstated that view may be.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-45"><a href="#para2-45" name="para2-45">2.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">From the point of view of legitimate journalism, it is right that the ICO should not interfere</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or over-regulate. It is also right that journalism should be judged primarily by what it prints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rather than be held to account at the newsgathering stage. A theme of this part of the Report,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">however, is that this does not mean that blanket exclusion from regular law enforcement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">measures is the only, or a very sensible, response. It is my conclusion that it is a part of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">culture, practices and ethics of some sections of the press that there is a sense of comparative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impunity and, in the main, of being beyond the reach of the law. This has not been in the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest, and needs to be rebalanced by a greater sense of awareness of the law and what is</span>
<a name="page1079"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">the continuum between the constraints of the law and aspiration towards good practice. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">existing procedural provisions of the DPA in relation to the press appear to be an unnecessary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and unwelcome inhibition to making progress towards that goal.</span>
<h4>Access to justice</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-46"><a href="#para2-46" name="para2-46">2.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In general, the DPA provides<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup> for individuals who suffer damage as a result of breach of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legal requirements of the regime to be entitled to financial compensation from the person or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisation responsible. It is a defence in such proceedings for the latter to show they had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken reasonable care to try to act in a way that is compliant with the law. If any individual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has suffered damage, compensation is also payable for distress. Where, however, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contravention relates to acquiring or using personal for the purposes of journalism, literature</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or art, compensation is payable for distress alone, without the need to prove physical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">damage. This is in recognition of the fact that the unlawful widespread public dissemination</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of someone&#8217;s personal information is capable of having a distressing impact in its own right;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this is the impact about which very many of the witnesses before the Inquiry have eloquently</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">spoken.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-47"><a href="#para2-47" name="para2-47">2.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In practice, however, the way that the courts have interpreted this entitlement to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compensation has been very limiting indeed. As a result, claims are rarely successful, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">even when successful have resulted in very small awards.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup> At its root the problem is that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the courts have been reluctant to award compensation for anything other than measurable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">financial loss caused by the breach of the regime. Nothing, in other words, is awarded for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the distress in its own right, but only if it has occasioned economic loss. But by its nature,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the subject matter of the regime, that is to say privacy, is unlikely to produce circumstances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in which breach straightforwardly causes pecuniary loss. The harm done is the invasion of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privacy itself.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref38" href="#footnote38">38</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-48"><a href="#para2-48" name="para2-48">2.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In other areas of the civil law, the courts have solved this problem by evolving a tariff</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of compensation to be paid for non-pecuniary loss. The best example is in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compensation for pain, suffering and loss of amenity in personal injury case. A more recent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(and perhaps more relevant) illustration is the award of damages for breach of contract</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where holidaymakers have been let down by travel companies or holiday operators. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whole point of the contract was the pleasure of a holiday with the result that compensation</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">will be payable for the disappointment.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-49"><a href="#para2-49" name="para2-49">2.49</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the face of it, the inability of victims of data protection breaches to obtain compensation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for distress in its own right is an anomaly for a regime whose principal purpose is to safeguard</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals from unlawful intrusion into their private lives. The practical problem facing any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attempt to address that lacuna, however, would be how to put a price on privacy in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way that the courts have evolved tariffs of compensation in other areas of &#8216;immeasurable&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">psychological or emotional harm.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-50"><a href="#para2-50" name="para2-50">2.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It must immediately be acknowledged that this is an issue which is relevant to activities in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to private information which go beyond journalism, and beyond public dissemination</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of information in breach of the data protection principles. Damages for non-pecuniary loss in</span>

<a name="page1080"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">privacy cases is a potentially large subject in its own right, and one which has an extremely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">large and detailed context in the law of damages more generally.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref39" href="#footnote39">39</a></sup> On the other hand, as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indicated above, the DPA makes special provision for compensation for distress unlawfully</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">caused by the press although this is a provision to which the courts have not in practice given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantive effect.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-51"><a href="#para2-51" name="para2-51">2.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coppel tested the issue with the example of the medical records of an individual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being published in a newspaper in breach of the DPA, that is to say, unfairly and without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legitimate public interest justification.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup> To that example might be added the example of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dissemination of intimate sexual details or nude photographs, again, for the purposes of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argument, unfairly and without legitimate public interest justification. Mr Coppel suggested:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;That, it seems to me, is a fundamental breach of what the Act is there to protect&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Should</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the measure of recompense be simply how much money the individual may lose as a result</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8211; and if none, should the individual be left to endure any amount of distress and personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">devastation uncompensated?</span>

<p id="para-id-2-52"><a href="#para2-52" name="para2-52">2.52</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The DPA has been amended in recent years to make provision for the Information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner to be able to impose monetary penalties, including in cases of this sort.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup> But</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">monetary penalties of course, while they may have a deterrent or punitive effect, still leave</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the victim uncompensated.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-53"><a href="#para2-53" name="para2-53">2.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Coppel&#8217;s own suggested solution has two elements. First, the Information Commissioner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be empowered to set a tariff of financial solace for breaches of the data protection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principles, referable to the duration, extent, gravity and profitability of their contravention,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such amounts to be in addition to amounts for damage and distress resulting from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contravention and to be followed by the Commissioner and the Courts. Secondly, a wronged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual should be provided with the choice of an alternative system to claim the tariff only,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with no provision for damages, legal costs or fees, such a system to be administered by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Information Commissioner.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-54"><a href="#para2-54" name="para2-54">2.54</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Within Mr Coppel&#8217;s analysis and conclusions, there are proposals that are specifically directed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the law relating to data protection; others have far wider ramifications into the law of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">damages. As for the proposed way forward in relation to the DPA, I accept that, at their heart,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they reflect a recognition that changes need to be made in order to provide a response to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the demand repeatedly expressed for the law to be properly enforced in relation to press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">misconduct and for individuals to have proper access to ways in which they can enforce their</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">rights.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-55"><a href="#para2-55" name="para2-55">2.55</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">More specifically, in relation to the &#8216;special enforcement regime&#8217; provided in the 1998 Act</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to the press, there are good grounds to conclude that it has had an unintended</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and damaging effect on the ability of the ICO to perform its functions. Exceptionally complex</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and largely unworkable in practice, it appears to have had a chilling effect on reasonable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">law enforcement and, equally, to have a high risk of impacting unfairly on individuals. In my</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">judgment, Mr Coppel&#8217;s view is correct: its removal would promote the overall public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and a balanced improvement in the culture, practices and ethics of the press in its approach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to personal information.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inreachingthatconclusion, Iamveryconsciousoftheneedtoensurethatlegitimatejournalism</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is not unduly impeded by attempts at pre-publication law enforcement on the one hand,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">albeit at the same time that individual liberties are not unduly stripped of their content by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being rendered wholly unenforceable before publication (and then to be defeated by the act</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of publication) on the other. It is my provisional view that this difficult, but essential balance,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is one which can and must be performed on a case by case basis by the ICO in considering</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the exercise of its powers, and that it is not one for which it is necessary or appropriate to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attempt to make further provision by law. If, however, it were thought desirable to do so, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would perhaps be possible to preserve expressly in the Act the principle that, in considering</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the exercise of any powers in relation to the press or other publishers, the ICO should have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">special regard to the obligation in law to balance the public interest in freedom of expression</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">alongside the public interest in upholding the data protection regime.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-57"><a href="#para2-57" name="para2-57">2.57</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Built into this balancing exercise should be a requirement on the ICO, when considering the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exercise of any of its powers, to have regard to the fact of membership of an accredited press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator by the relevant title: this should be capable of establishing the proposition that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">title subscribes to recognised and approved standards of conduct which are, themselves,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforceable.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-58"><a href="#para2-58" name="para2-58">2.58</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The proposals for adjusting the boundaries and operation of the press exemption in s32 is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a more difficult exercise. Although I am minded to the view that there is, indeed, an issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about compatibility, I do not consider that it is necessary for me to resolve whether there is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any incompatibility between the provision as interpreted by UK courts and the UK&#8217;s European</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and international obligations. What I am, however, clear about is that there is room within</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the latitude afforded by those obligations for a fairer, more even-handed balance, and that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">improvement in that respect is, both as a matter of both law and policy, desirable.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-59"><a href="#para2-59" name="para2-59">2.59</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I therefore recommend that the policy represented by the suggested revisions to section 32</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the DPA should be given effect to by suitable amendment to the Act. In doing so, I consider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that particular attention should be addressed to one area where further refinement of that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">policy seems to me to be desirable.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-60"><a href="#para2-60" name="para2-60">2.60</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The removal of the blanket exemption from the fundamental right of subject access currently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provided by s32 seems to me to be right for the reasons considered above. But there are</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">special considerations relating to the exercise of a right of this nature in relation to the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to which careful attention needs to be paid. It remains necessary for the right to be balanced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">against the special protections afforded by the law to journalists&#8217; sources. That protection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is not absolute as the law stands, but it is extensive. On the face of it, the existing general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">limitations on the subject access right which are designed to safeguard third party information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">do appear generally apt to follow the existing (important) protection for journalists&#8217; sources.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If it were thought that there was any doubt about the matter, however, that doubt should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resolved by a provision to the effect that the right of subject access is not intended to displace</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the general law on the inaccessibility of journalists&#8217; sources.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-61"><a href="#para2-61" name="para2-61">2.61</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Turning to the question of damages, I do not consider that it is appropriate for the Information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner to be setting a tariff of financial solace for breaches of data protection or why</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this should be different from damages for distress (which might themselves be linked to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">damages for breach of other privacy rights). The proper place for the assessment of damages</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(or non pecuniary compensation) is allied to the consideration of damages across this area of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the law. I return to this topic when dealing with the civil law.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup></span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref43" name="footnote43" title="Go back to footnote reference 43 in the text">43</a>.  Part J, Chapter 3</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1082"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-2-62"><a href="#para2-62" name="para2-62">2.62</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In making these recommendations, I accept that the current state of the legal framework in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to the ICO&#8217;s civil law enforcement powers goes some way to explain the indications</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of reluctance by the ICO to take an active, or any significant, interest in the formal exercise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of their regulatory functions in relation to the press. I do not, however, accept that as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complete explanation. In reality, there is a lack of evidence that the ICO has, over the years:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) regarded the symptoms of deficiencies in the culture, practices and ethics of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to personal information as a serious operational priority;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) shown a will to test in practice the powers and procedures conferred by law specifically</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the legal obligations of the regime by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press &#8211; however attenuated those obligations and however difficult those procedures;</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) drawn attention politically to any perceived shortcomings in the legal framework in this</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">respect.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This raises questions about a possibly deeper reluctance to accept an active role in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the press. Neither do I accept that other operational priorities must be accepted without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more as an explanation for ICO inactivity in an area which the very existence of this Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">demonstrates to be a matter of acute public concern.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-63"><a href="#para2-63" name="para2-63">2.63</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">While recommending changes to the law, I do not intend to encourage the idea that the ICO</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should continue to take no steps to address the culture, practices and ethics of the press in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the meantime. I therefore additionally recommend that the ICO should take immediate steps</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to prepare, adopt and publish a policy on the exercise of its formal regulatory functions in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">order to ensure that the press complies with the legal requirements of the data protection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regime. I explain elsewhere, it is also my recommendation that in future such a policy should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expressly provide that membership of an effective and independent self-organised system of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards regulation should be able to be taken into account by the ICO in contemplating the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exercise of those functions.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-64"><a href="#para2-64" name="para2-64">2.64</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I further recommend that the ICO take immediate steps to publish advice aimed at individuals</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">concernedthattheyareormayhavebeenvictimsofunlawfuluseoftheirpersonalinformation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the press. That might, for example, take the form suggested above, of enabling individuals,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on application to the ICO, to obtain confirmation in so far as the office is able to offer it of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether they can be identified among the Motorman victims, and if so in relation to which</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">title or titles, and to obtain assistance if necessary in making a suitable request to those titles.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It might also take the form of engaging with victims&#8217; representative organisations to those</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">ends.</span>

<h3>Promoting good practice: journalism and ss51-52 DPA</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-65"><a href="#para2-65" name="para2-65">2.65</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In considering the role of the ICO in relation to the conduct of the press in connection with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the handling of personal information, it is sensible to start with ss51-52 of the DPA.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup> These</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are among the simpler and more straightforward aspects of the application of the data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protection regime to the press and it has not been suggested that the provisions should not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be taken at other than face value. In short, they provide that:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) the ICO has a positive duty to promote the following of good practice in relation to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">handling of personal information by the press, no less than in the case of any other</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">business;</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref44" name="footnote44" title="Go back to footnote reference 44 in the text">44</a>.  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/section/51; http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/section/52</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1083"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) the ICO also has a positive duty to promote the observance of the legal requirements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the DPA by the press, in so far as they apply;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) the powers of the ICO in relation to the dissemination of public information and industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">guidance apply in the context of the press industry;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) the powers of the ICO to encourage sections of industry to develop and apply codes of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">good practice in the handling of personal information apply to the press sector;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) the duty of the ICO to make an annual report to Parliament on the exercise of its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">functions includes a power to cover press aspects in that report; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(f) the power of the ICO to make special reports to Parliament includes the ability to make</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">special reports about the intersection between the data protection regime in practice,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the culture, practices and ethics of the press in relation to personal information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(which provision provided the basis for the laying of the<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy?</span> Reports).</span>

<p id="para-id-2-66"><a href="#para2-66" name="para2-66">2.66</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As a matter of ordinary public law, the exercise of any of these powers has to be kept under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">review, considered within the overall framework and purposes of the data protection regime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a whole, and both reasonable and proportionate in all the circumstances. On the face of it,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant considerations in that context would include matters such as the extent of objective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence of poor practice along with the nature and seriousness of that poor practice and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">levels of public concern. Evidence of widespread ignorance of the requirements of law and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">good practice (whether on the part of industry or individual) would be particularly relevant,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">especially if that ignorance were related to the genuine complexity of those requirements. As</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an expert regulator, the ICO would then be in a unique position to address the problem with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explanation, education and support.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-67"><a href="#para2-67" name="para2-67">2.67</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of course, the exercise of any of these powers in relation to the press would also have to take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into account the wider legal context, including respecting in full the balance to be struck both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in law and in policy between the liberties of the individual and the vital requirements of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">free press. That wider context would certainly affect the manner in which the powers were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exercised, and the content of any guidance, codes, reports and so on. But it does not on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">face of it appear to constitute a limitation on the existence or potential value of these powers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-68"><a href="#para2-68" name="para2-68">2.68</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For my part, I do not see any defect in these provisions which could limit their ability to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">contribute to the promotion of good standards of behaviour in the press in the handling of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private information: none has been overtly suggested. There has been no suggestion, for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">example, that throughout the period in which Mr Thomas was trying to encourage the PCC to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">promote good practice in the industry, including by means of its own Codes and guidance, he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was in any way inhibited as a matter of law by the legislation governing the ICO from acting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in those areas or fulfilling those requirements himself.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-69"><a href="#para2-69" name="para2-69">2.69</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If there were any real doubt in the matter, legislation could put its application to the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">beyond doubt. Indeed, it would also be possible to introduce new positive duties in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the press, for example to insert positive duties into the legislation as follows:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) into s1(3) for the ICO, in consultation with the industry and the public, to exercise the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">power to issue comprehensive guidance to the press on good practice in the handling</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of personal information;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) into s51(2) to exercise the power to issue comprehensive guidance to the public on their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual rights in relation to the obtaining and use by the press of their information,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and how to exercise them; and</span>
<a name="page1084"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) into s52 to include in the ICO&#8217;s annual report to Parliament an account of its perspective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on press compliance with law and good practice in the handling of personal information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and to draw special attention to any concerns.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having said that, I should make it clear that I do not see any reason to doubt that the ICO</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could exercise his powers in these ways as the law presently stands.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-70"><a href="#para2-70" name="para2-70">2.70</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I do not accept that there is any reason in law to explain the failure of the ICO to use these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">powers by taking active steps to address the need for improvement in the standards of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the practices of the press in relation to the handling of personal information. Successive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioners have emphasised that this drive for good practice function is the cornerstone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the entire regulatory regime. Unfortunately, evidence to justify serious concern about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standards of the press in this respect has been available and well publicised: an informed,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">well-targeted, proactive and engaged approach to the problem might have made a real</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">difference. It is a matter of regret to record that the failure by the ICO to address this issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">must be regarded as a regulatory opportunity missed.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-71"><a href="#para2-71" name="para2-71">2.71</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In those circumstances, I recommend that, in discharge of its functions and duties to promote</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">good practice in areas of public concern, the ICO should take immediate steps, in consultation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the press, to prepare and issue comprehensive good practice guidelines and advice. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should include the articulation of principles and standards dealing with the acquisition and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">use of personal information. I hope and anticipate that the press will actively cooperate in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the preparation and implementation of such guidelines and advice, not least so as to ensure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that its Article 10 rights are fully recognised and reflected in the work. In those circumstances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I would expect the guidelines and advice to be prepared and implemented no later than six</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">months from the date of this Report.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-72"><a href="#para2-72" name="para2-72">2.72</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I also recommend that the ICO take steps to prepare and issue comprehensive guidance to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public on their individual rights in relation to the obtaining and use by the press of their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information, and how to exercise them. To demonstrate the effect of this guidance, the ICO</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should include regular updates on the practices of the press in relation to handling of personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information in its annual reports to Parliament.</span>

<h3>Criminal Law: the sentence for breach of s55 DPA</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-73"><a href="#para2-73" name="para2-73">2.73</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The history of the campaign started by Mr Thomas to amend s55 DPA to introduce the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">possibility of custodial penalties on conviction (by providing a statutory maximum of two years</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">imprisonment) has been set out. The position is that the Criminal Justice and Immigration</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Act 2008 introduced that amendment, but the changes had not been brought into force. A</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statutory instrument, to be laid before Parliament by the Government, is required.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-74"><a href="#para2-74" name="para2-74">2.74</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As a matter of principle, the existence of uncommenced legislation on the statute books is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potentially problematic. The power of the Secretary of State to commence legislation must,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by law, be kept under review, so it always remains a live issue. As described elsewhere,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup> the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legislative process by which the maximum penalty was increased and the defence to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantive offence available to journalists broadened, with both changes left uncommenced,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was strongly indicative of a political compromise, designed as much as anything to quieten</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">two opposing campaigning voices rather than as a response to a thought through policy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">analysis for which there was genuine empirical evidence. It is not surprising to find that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">delicate balance of the compromise has not proved something which succeeding Secretaries</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of State for Justice have been in a hurry to revisit.</span>

<a name="page1085"></a><!--new page--><h4>Recent history of the ICO&#8217;s s55 campaign</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-75"><a href="#para2-75" name="para2-75">2.75</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In October 2009, the Government published a consultation paper in seeking views on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commencement of both parts of the changes.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup> Responses were sought by January 2010,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with a view to assessing the possibility of activating the changes in the April of that year,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the same time as it was proposed to confer on the ICO enhanced powers in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">civil penalties. It does not appear that the responses to that consultation exercise have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been published by the Ministry of Justice. However, the press has consistently opposed the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commencement of the provisions and the then Government did not bring the new provisions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into force in what were the final weeks before the General Election. Neither has the current</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Administration advanced the position: a decision is now said to await this Report.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-76"><a href="#para2-76" name="para2-76">2.76</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Successive Information Commissioners have continued to press for the increased penalties</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be brought into force. Mr Thomas repeated his case in his first witness statement to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The main reform, in my view, should be an immediate ministerial Order to activate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the prison sentence for s55 offences. The public controversy of the last two months,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and public outrage at press misconduct, make the case for that reform more pressing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">than ever. Even if there has been improvement in press conduct since 2006 there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is still no guarantee that this will remain indefinitely and I understand that illegal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">activity remains rife in other sectors. A strong deterrent is needed and it is vital that a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">clear signal should be sent that s55 offences are not trivial or &#8220;technical&#8221;.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">His exasperation was evident in his oral evidence to the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I cannot for the life of me understand why the Government has now not activated</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that provision. &#8230; I am very disappointed as an individual now that still, despite all the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">materialthathassurfacedinrecentmonths,theorderhasnotbeenactivated.Itwould</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be a very simple matter to bring that into force now, and my broad understanding</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">back in 2008 was that it would only be a delay of six months or so, but that has not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">yet materialised.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-77"><a href="#para2-77" name="para2-77">2.77</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The ICO campaign on s55 has continued under Mr Graham, but with a perceptible change</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of emphasis. The ICO submitted evidence to the consultation on activation of the new</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">provisions at the end of 2009<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref49" href="#footnote49">49</a></sup> but, by this time, Motorman was presented as somewhat</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">distant history. The ICO submission focused instead on examples, including half a dozen case</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">studies, of the blagging of personal information by deceit in the routine criminal contexts of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unscrupulous debt-collection, commercial espionage and profiteering, and personal grudge</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and intimidation. Judicial sentencing remarks in cases prosecuted are cited to the effect that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the sentence maxima on s55 conviction did not allow a sentence to be passed commensurate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the criminality of the behaviour. An example is given of ICO investigators executing a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">search warrant:</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a section 55 offence, with the following comments. &#8216;What&#8217;s the maximum fine for this,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#163;5000? I will write the cheque out now.&#8217;&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At the other end of spectrum, Mr Graham explained in evidence that he wanted to:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;deal with the problem of the courts being limited to fines and then dealing with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people who are of limited means and can only be fined about &#163;100, and the court</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">doesn&#8217;t have the option of doing anything about a community sentence or tagging or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">curfew or whatever else might be involved. It&#8217;s just the going rate is &#163;100. It happened</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">again the week before last. It&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-78"><a href="#para2-78" name="para2-78">2.78</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Other general points are made in the ICO submission to the consultation exercise about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the consequences of s55 not being capable of attracting a custodial penalty. Two points in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular should be noted:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;At present the offence of unlawful obtaining etc is not a recordable offence. It is not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">therefore recorded on the Police National Computer. Fingerprint impressions, DNA</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">samples and descriptive details are not currently taken from those individuals who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are prosecuted by the ICO for the section 55 offence (a descriptive form contains</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">personal information relative to the accused person, for example, ethnic appearance,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">build, shoe size, glasses, hair, facial hair, marks, scars and abnormalities etc). If the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">penalties for this offence are increased to imprisonment the offence will become a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recordable offence. This will not only underline the serious nature of the offence but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">will ensure that those convicted carry a meaningful criminal record.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The criminal record is both a matter of deterrence in its own right and also of assisting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">detection. The second point made is that, with a custodial penalty available, s55 crime could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fit within the framework of the European arrest warrants; data crime is an easy cross-border</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">activity, and the availability of simple extradition procedures would overcome jurisdictional</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inhibitions to criminal enforcement.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-79"><a href="#para2-79" name="para2-79">2.79</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Subsequently, including in an update report to the Ministry of Justice in August 2011<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">51</a></sup> and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the evidence that Mr Graham provided to the Inquiry, the ICO has sought to turn the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">spotlight in relation to s55 definitively away from the press altogether. As discussed above,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that is articulated by way of an assertion that the practices of the press are no longer an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue in relation to information blagging. From the perspective of the ICO, however, given the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">history of the s55 campaign, there is no doubt a degree to which the press are simply seen as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the principal inhibition to the commencement of these provisions. The policy is now to seek</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to neutralise the hostility of the press and emphasising that the policy aim to be achieved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">now has little to do with their activities no doubt has that in mind. Mr Graham illustrated this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in his evidence when he said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref52" href="#footnote52">52</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In fact, I went to the Society of Editors conference in 2009 and said: &#8216;it&#8217;s so not about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you. It&#8217;s about NHS workers, it&#8217;s about private investigators, it&#8217;s about bank clerks, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it&#8217;s frustrating not to be able to deal with that real challenge, which the Information</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Commissioner&#8217;s office is concerned to deal with, because we&#8217;re constantly met by the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">press saying, &#8220;This is terrible, the sky is falling, the sky is falling&#8221;. It really isn&#8217;t.&#8217;&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">That the tension between the ICO and the press on the s55 issue is still very much a current</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">source of heat was vividly illustrated by exchanges between Mr Graham and Mr Rhodri</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Davies QC, asking questions on behalf of News International. This exchange is set out at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some length here because it illustrated in microcosm, and in many ways can be regarded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as the summation of, the long years of debate and lobbying on this subject, in Parliament,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in successive Governments, and in other public fora. Mr Davies put it to Mr Graham that,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if the behaviour of the press was not itself the current operational focus of the campaign,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nevertheless:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The political problem, if I can call it that, that you have in getting the existing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">legislation into force is what we might call the perceived effect on the press. It&#8217;s not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the bank clerks who are campaigning against this; it&#8217;s the perceived effect on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press which is your problem?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. My problem is the press. It&#8217;s not the perceived effect on the press, it&#8217;s the behaviour</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the press, worrying away at a penalty designed to deal with a problem which they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">say doesn&#8217;t apply to them, and I say, &#8220;If it doesn&#8217;t apply to you, get out of the way.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Isn&#8217;t the way through this, which might perhaps satisfy both parties, simply to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">exempt from the threat of a prison sentence anyone who is acting for the special</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">purposes of journalism, artistic or literary matters, using the phraseology in Section</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">32?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. How much of a good deal do you guys want? Excuse me, sir, for being heated</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about this, but you fought everyone to a standstill back in 2006/7. You did it again in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2009/10. You&#8217;ve got so many privileges and exemptions. It&#8217;s perfectly possible for a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalist to do a decent job legally. There is Section 78 [of the Criminal Justice and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Immigration Act 2008] on the statute book, applying the reasonable belief of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalist that what they were doing for publication was in the public interest. It&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">going to be very difficult for anyone to strike that down, but there are some people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who believe that that&#8217;s more generous to the press than really should have been the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">case, but that was the deal. Now, if I understand it, you&#8217;re sort of coming back for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more - on behalf of your clients.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. What I&#8217;m trying to do, Mr Graham, is to point out a route through the problem,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or one that bypasses the Gordian Knot, and I&#8217;m not quite understanding why this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">solution is not acceptable to you.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. Well, this isn&#8217;t a negotiation about these things, but it sounds to me as if the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">representatives of the press want to be somehow above the law. Surely a free press</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">operates within a framework of law, and a vibrant and healthy press, challenging</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">those in authority and doing the job that it should be doing and the job that I joined</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the profession to do, operates within the law. Yes, okay, you sometimes have to apply</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the dark arts to get the story, and then you&#8217;re accountable for it. And if you&#8217;re really</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in trouble, that&#8217;s the mitigation that you put to the court. But we can&#8217;t keep having</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more and more carve-outs and reductions and special cases, surely.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. The point is, Mr Graham, that prison sentences do have a more chilling effect</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">than the lesser sanctions available to the court -</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Is that right, Mr Rhodri Davies? I&#8217;d be very interested to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">see evidence about that, because one thing is for rock solid certain: interception of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">communications did have a custodial sentence attached to it, and it didn&#8217;t seem to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have stopped a great deal of activity.</span>

<a name="page1088"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;MR DAVIES: Well, that certainly was true-up to 2006/7, I entirely understand that.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: I&#8217;m not, I think, trying to make a cheap point. I&#8217;m not doing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that at all. But I am concerned about the evidence base for the assertion. I&#8217;m not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">stopping you, I understand the point, and of course you can pursue it.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;MR DAVIES: Well, I think - really, what I&#8217;m putting to you, Mr Graham, is your own</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">assumption, which is that if the sentences available for breach of Section 55 are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">increased and the range of sanctions available to the court is widened, then you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think that that will have a beneficially chilling effect on people who would otherwise</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contemplate a breach of Section 55?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. It would have a beneficially chilling effect on DVLC workers handing out car</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">numbers and addresses based on those car numbers in exchange for money. It will</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have a beneficial chilling effect on health workers who apparently think it&#8217;s perfectly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">okay to access someone&#8217;s medical records in order to find the telephone numbers of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">their in-laws, who they&#8217;re having a fight with, or the bank clerk in Haywards Heath</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who thinks it&#8217;s fine to look at someone&#8217;s bank records in order to provide the case in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">her husband&#8217;s defence in a sex attack trial. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re dealing with. What&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that got to do with the press? If you&#8217;re not doing this stuff, get out of the way.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. Yes. I entirely understand those problems.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-81"><a href="#para2-81" name="para2-81">2.81</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Davies took Mr Graham through some practical examples of where the public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">defence might be relied on by a journalist in a s55 case. These drew on the sort of material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which emerged in Motorman. The exchange continued:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref54" href="#footnote54">54</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;MR DAVIES: So that is a situation, Mr Graham, where, as I understand it, you think</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the journalist might very well have a public interest defence?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;A. I say it&#8217;s arguable, anyway.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;Q. It&#8217;s arguable. That&#8217;s the difficulty, isn&#8217;t it? Because once we&#8217;re into the territory</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">of it&#8217;s arguable, and it&#8217;s a prison sentence if you&#8217;re wrong, do we not have a chilling</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">effect?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A. But all you have to advance is the reasonable belief that the story you&#8217;re pursuing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was in the public interest. Really, if you can&#8217;t make that case, you shouldn&#8217;t be in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalism. It&#8217;s a very, very good increased defence for journalists.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. I&#8217;m just wondering how far that goes. So you say if there&#8217;s a reasonable belief that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the story you&#8217;re pursuing is in the public interest, then that would be a public interest</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">defence to obtaining an ex-directory telephone number?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: I&#8217;m not going to allow you, Mr Davies, to use the opportunity</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to try and tie the Information Commissioner down. Let me say what I presently</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">believe, and then people can make submissions in due course. I presently believe that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the new potential provision contains both subjective and objective elements, so not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">only must the journalist believe that it&#8217;s in the public interest to do so, but there must</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be reasonable grounds for that belief. Thereafter, if I follow up your earlier question,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Information Commissioner would have to decide whether there was evidence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to rebut that defence before he thought of bringing a prosecution. If he thought of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bringing a prosecution because he thought he could rebut the defence, it would be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">open to the journalist to advance the defence in court. If the court decided against the</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref54" name="footnote54" title="Go back to footnote reference 54 in the text">54</a>.  pp62-63, lines 5-19, Christopher Graham, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-26-January-2012.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1089"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalist, then it would have to decide on a scale how grave the particular offence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was, and in my experience of sentencing criminal cases, which extends over 27 years,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll find that there would be any question of a mandatory sentence in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">those circumstances at all.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-82"><a href="#para2-82" name="para2-82">2.82</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">No further formal submissions were in fact received by the Inquiry on this subject and it now</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">falls therefore to reflect on the extent to which this Report should seek to resolve the matter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on way or the other. I do not, for the reasons set out above, accept that I should avoid doing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so on the grounds that I can be confident that the culture, practices and ethics of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are such that it is simply no longer a live issue within the Terms of Reference of the Inquiry.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Bearing in mind those Terms of Reference, however, it is important to make clear two points.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of forensically), is not the concern of this Inquiry and not something on which this Report</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can or should express a view. Secondly, since the operational considerations currently being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advanced in favour of commencing the increased maxima are explicitly said to be directed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">elsewhere than in the direction of the press, these are not considerations within the purview</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of this Inquiry and not matters on which it would be appropriate for this Report to have a</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">S55, in other words, is not a provision of exclusive application to the press, and it is necessary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that I should be suitably circumspect about any effect of considering the matter otherwise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than in relation to the press. S55 is, however, a provision which, as amended, has a specific and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">modified application to the press, and to that extent the uncommenced amendments must</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be considered to be part of the special approach to journalism that is evident throughout</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the data protection regime. It is also a provision the history of which, up to and including the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">present day, has been dominated by the press&#8217;s policy interests. It is impossible therefore</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to avoid reflecting on the history of the s55 issue in the context of this Report at any rate in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to the press dimension to the policy.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-85"><a href="#para2-85" name="para2-85">2.85</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is not in any event, as indicated above, simply a policy issue at large. Parliament has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered this matter in extensive detail and legislated on it. The very strong presumption</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">must be that Parliament does not legislate in idleness. Deferred implementation of legislation,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the rare instances in which that is deliberate policy, is usually a matter of making provision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for preliminary practical issues or, as in this case, to allow for contingent events. The s55</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contingency might be described as a policy of waiting to see whether the mere uncommenced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">existence of the possibility of a prison sentence would itself prove to be a deterrent to criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">activity. There appears to be ample evidence that criminal activity comprising the knowing or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reckless misuse of personal information continues to be a real problem, and that specifically</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the absence of a potential custodial sentence (which would therefore permit sentences short</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of custody such as a community penalty) has emerged as a contributory factor. This is not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">least because, as Mr Graham made clear, a financial penalty must be related to means to pay</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and those of limited means will therefore face potential sanctions which have little correlation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the gravity of the offence and the potential for harm.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-86"><a href="#para2-86" name="para2-86">2.86</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The only reason which has been cited to the Inquiry for failure to commence the provisions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for increasing the maximum potential sentence is the potentially damaging effect that it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would have on journalism. These are not considerations which, in my view, can reasonably</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argued to be persuasive, let alone determinative.</span>
<a name="page1090"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-2-87"><a href="#para2-87" name="para2-87">2.87</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the first place, the argument that the prospect of custody would have a differential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;chilling&#8217; effect on lawful and ethical journalism from the prospect of a financial penalty</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is one which it is barely respectable for national press organisations to advance at all. Its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary implication is that the prospect of a criminal conviction can, of itself, be regarded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a tolerable business risk, and a criminal fine a tolerable overhead, in journalism. This says</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">little more than that &#8216;unchilled&#8217; journalism is an activity which takes calculated risks with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deliberate and indefensible criminality. This is an argument for criminal impunity including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(as it was put before the Inquiry) by way of a plea for indemnity from the otherwise universal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">application of criminal penalties; it amounts to special pleading to be placed above the law.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I put the matter starkly, because no-one reading this Report should be in any doubt as to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">true nature of the argument being advanced on behalf of the press in its most unqualified</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">form.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-88"><a href="#para2-88" name="para2-88">2.88</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is a more respectable version of the argument that there is a chilling effect in this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provision. That version is not a contention that the press should be indulged in committing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">calculated criminality. It is an argument that the boundaries in this territory between what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is criminal and what is not are not clear enough to make it safe for journalists to operate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">confidently. It is not an argument therefore about the consequences of criminality but about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the risks of crossing criminal boundaries unwittingly. Where the boundaries are unclear, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">possibility of a custodial penalty raises the stakes to the extent that decent journalists will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have to take a risk-averse approach and give them a wide berth. The result, so the argument</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">goes, is that some areas of investigative journalism on the right side of the law will be lost and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this would be contrary to the public interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-89"><a href="#para2-89" name="para2-89">2.89</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This remains an argument which envisages journalism tracking the boundaries of crime in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way which is not, and has not been over the years in which the s55 issue has been debated,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">empirically evidenced as a genuine operational problem to any degree; neither does it deal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the ethical (and indeed legal) questions which are raised by behaviour which is only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">just on the right side of crime. But the important point is that it is essentially an argument</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about whether the provision made in the new defence to cater for journalistic operations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where they do sail close to the wind is adequate. If the defence deals satisfactorily with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the boundaries between criminal and lawful journalism, then the question of the ultimate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">penalty must be a genuine second-order issue.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-90"><a href="#para2-90" name="para2-90">2.90</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is hard to see how the new defence could go any further. If a journalist engages in a course</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of conduct which<span style="font-style:italic"> prima</span><span style="font-style:italic"> facie</span> crosses the criminal boundary marking the unlawful acquisition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of personal information, but can show that he or she was acting with a view to publication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and in the reasonable belief that it was in the public interest, there can be no conviction.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Note that it is not even necessary to show that the conduct was in fact, in the end, in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest. There is no alternative to asking the journalist to establish that the belief was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">genuine, because its basis will be uniquely within his or her own knowledge. And if the belief</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was neither genuine nor rational it is hard to see the case for a defence to crime. The provision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made by the new defence to give honest journalists trying to respect the boundaries of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal law confidence in doing so, appears to be straightforward to understand, and more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than adequate in giving honesty the benefit of the doubt.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-91"><a href="#para2-91" name="para2-91">2.91</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am, therefore, entirely unpersuaded that the argument that there is a possible chilling</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effect on legitimate journalism is a reasonable one, and should be regarded as a proper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reason in itself for continuing to resist giving effect to the legislation. Much more the point:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Parliament has already settled the matter from a policy point of view. To the extent that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press effectively wishes to reopen not the question of penal policy but the matter of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantive law itself, it is both too late and devoid of merit. Without suggesting that no other</span>
<a name="page1091"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">formulation of the new defence is imaginable, Parliament has given very close attention to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the alternatives, and settled on something which, on any fair analysis, is fully capable of being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made to work for the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-92"><a href="#para2-92" name="para2-92">2.92</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">IamconsciousthatinrecommendingtheactivationoftheamendmentstotheDataProtection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Act created by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, this Report is dealing with an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue with considerable history, and not just as a matter of addressing the culture, practices</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and ethics of the press in relation the acquisition and use of private personal information. It is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also addressing the operations of the press as powerful lobbyists on self-interested questions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of media law and policy. On both of these grounds, I conclude that the public interest, taken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the round, favours there being no further delay in the implementation of this measure.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-93"><a href="#para2-93" name="para2-93">2.93</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As indicated in the Government consultation paper,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref55" href="#footnote55">55</a></sup> therefore, I recommend that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary steps are taken (by statutory instrument) to increase the sentence maxima on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conviction for an offence under s55, to include, in addition to the current fines, custodial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">penalties up to the statutory maximum on summary conviction, and, on conviction on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indictment, up to two years&#8217; imprisonment.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-94"><a href="#para2-94" name="para2-94">2.94</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is important to underline that I also recommend that the enhanced defence for public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest journalism be activated at the same time.</span>
<h4>Prosecution powers of the ICO</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-95"><a href="#para2-95" name="para2-95">2.95</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Before concluding this part of the Report, a number of further aspects of the criminal law</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">functions of the ICO in relation to the press fall to be considered. One particularly important</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">piece of context to the s55 debate is the fact that this is the only offence in respect of which the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO has prosecution powers. There are other criminal offences which are also contraventions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the data protection regime when committed in relation to personal information (which,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">incidentally, already attract the possibility of custodial sentences). There may be considerable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">overlap between these other offences and s55. Examples include:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) phone hacking contrary to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref56" href="#footnote56">56</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) computer hacking contrary to the Computer Misuse Act 1990;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref57" href="#footnote57">57</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) offences of corruption, bribery and aiding and abetting misconduct in public office; and</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) inchoate and accessory offences including attempt and conspiracy.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-96"><a href="#para2-96" name="para2-96">2.96</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is indeed an argument that, since the first data protection principle requires that all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acquisition and use of personal information must be fair and lawful, all criminal offences in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to personal information within the meaning of the data protection regime will also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">constitute a breach of that regime.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref58" href="#footnote58">58</a></sup> In practice, in any case in which a breach of the data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protection regime may also constitute a criminal offence<span style="font-style:italic"> other</span><span style="font-style:italic"> than</span> under s55, the ICO will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effectively hand the matter in its entirety, and defer wholly, to the police and the CPS. That</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is at least in part because all of the other offences comprehend, including by way of higher</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sentencing maxima, a much wider spectrum of seriousness. That is important context for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the decision in Motorman itself which, effectively, was to stand back from the prosecution</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">process while the police and CPS proceeded with corruption and conspiracy prosecutions.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">But it has two important practical consequences.</span>

<a name="page1092"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-2-97"><a href="#para2-97" name="para2-97">2.97</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first consequence is that it effectively relegates s55 to a wholly residuary position, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice only of real use in cases where all other criminal possibilities have been eliminated.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">But the process of elimination itself may, including by reason of delay, weaken the prospect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the end of bringing s55 charges. Secondly, it also puts the ICO at a disadvantage in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considering cases of breach of the data protection principles in the round, including giving</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">full consideration to alternatives to prosecution. So in cases at the extreme end of breaches</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the principles and rights of the regime, the expert regulator is in danger of being left out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the picture altogether.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-98"><a href="#para2-98" name="para2-98">2.98</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Graham explained the position in his witness statement to the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In some circumstances, such as an allegation of unlawful processing, I have to rely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the police and the CPS to indicate whether they consider that an offence under</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">another relevant Act has been committed before I can properly assess whether there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">has also been an associated breach of the data protection principle on which I might</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">act. On the other hand if my office comes into possession of evidence which suggests</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that an offence has been committed under other legislation, I would pass this directly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the police or suggest to a complainant that he or she does so&#8230;..</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It is possible that, in some circumstances, personal data could be obtained in a way</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that suggests the commission of offences under both another Act and under section</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">55 of the Act. The investigation of offences which carry a custodial penalty takes</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">precedence over the investigation of offences, such as those under the Act, which do</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not. Usually, the police will take the lead in investigating where penalties that carry</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a custodial penalty are suspected. They can consider the offence under section 55 of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Act as part of their investigation if they choose to do so. Whilst my office will pass</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relevant information on to the police to assist them in any investigation, it does not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">make good sense for us to run our own investigation in parallel.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-99"><a href="#para2-99" name="para2-99">2.99</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As considered at length above, this cannot stand as a full account of the operational inaction</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the ICO in relation to the press and its involvement in Operation Motorman. But it does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggest a weakness in the scheme of the powers and functions of the ICO. It is a weakness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which would be remedied<span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> part</span> by the activation of the higher sentence maxima for s55</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because, at least, it would address the problem of its role as an offence of last resort by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strengthening the ability of the ICO to prosecute s55 cases<span style="font-style:italic"> which</span><span style="font-style:italic"> also</span> constitute other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offences. But it would not address the position of the ICO as a prosecutor of last resort or the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">disabling effect of that on its consideration of the exercise of its other regulatory functions in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to serious abuses of personal information.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-100"><a href="#para2-100" name="para2-100">2.100</a></p>
 This isa point of considerable importance for that strand of opinion in relation to phone
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking that urged that the primary response of this Inquiry should be to ensure that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">existing law (and, in particular, the existing criminal law) is properly enforced. As fully set out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">above,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup> the huge investment of the resources of the Metropolitan Police in their current</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operations Weeting (phone hacking), Tuleta (computer hacking), and Elveden (corruption)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is both unsustainable indefinitely and unrepeatable in the future. It is, however, noteworthy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that all concern the possibility of the press committing crimes which involves the acquisition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of personal information in breach of the data protection principles.</span>

 Information crime in contexts involving neither national security issues nor the furtherance
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of other criminal purposes (that is to say, crime constituted wholly by the extreme violation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of personal information privacy), is a matter which cannot hold a place at the top of the police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">agenda in competition with the many other priorities that the police face. Nor, in any event,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can the police be expected to invest in the deep expertise in personal information privacy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which the data protection regime envisages in for its own regulatory authority. Furthermore,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the handling by the police of these cases is effectively binary: charges are either brought or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dropped, without consideration of law enforcement issues falling short of criminal liability.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The present disposition of prosecution powers therefore presents a threat to the proper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforcement of privacy crime in the future, including in relation to the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-102"><a href="#para2-102" name="para2-102">2.102</a></p>
 One possible way to address that problem would be to enable the ICO to prosecute breaches
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the data protection regime which constituted criminal offences<span style="font-style:italic"> whether</span><span style="font-style:italic"> or</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span> they did so</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a result of s55. This would, in particular, enable the ICO to deal with cases of data abuse</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">going beyond the processes of first acquisition of the information. It would have a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specific advantages. It would:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) relieve the police and CPS of the pressure of privacy crime on their priorities and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resources;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) place prosecution in the hands of an expert regulator who would be well placed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigate cases and if appropriate place their full criminality before the criminal courts;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) enable cases to be dealt with within the rounded context of a regulatory regime which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has a range of other operational options falling short of prosecution.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Three matters would, however, have to be addressed in taking forward thinking in this context.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-103"><a href="#para2-103" name="para2-103">2.103</a></p>
 The first is the necessity of acknowledging,</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> again, that this is not an issue of sole application
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the press, and that it is beyond the purview of this Inquiry to address its implications in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">areas which have nothing to do with its terms of reference. As against that, however, it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary to note the very close association of the issue of prosecution powers with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">s55 issue as discussed extensively above. And whereas it is to a degree speculative to reflect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the Motorman case itself from this perspective, there are genuine questions, including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those raised at the time and since by the ICO itself, as to whether in the circumstance an</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">information regulator, alive to the magnitude and nature of the breach of the law and good</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice of the data protection regime and armed with a full range of responses up to and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including prosecution for serious offences, would not have afforded the best prospects of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effective law enforcement and of making the case a turning point for the good in the culture,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and ethics of the press in the handling of personal information.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-104"><a href="#para2-104" name="para2-104">2.104</a></p>
 The second matter that would need to be addressed would be the capability and governance
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the ICO itself in handling any enhanced prosecution functions. In so far as those questions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have wider implications they are addressed more generally below. But it would be highly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">desirable to ensure that in all of its prosecution functions there was excellent liaison between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ICO and the police and CPS. It might, for example, be desirable to make the exercise of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any powers to prosecute s55 cases which also constitute or may constitute other criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offences and criminal breaches of the data protection regime falling outside s55 formally the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subject of a duty to consult with the CPS.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-105"><a href="#para2-105" name="para2-105">2.105</a></p>
 The third matter concerns the position of the press as the potential subjects of criminal
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation by the ICO. Under that heading two issues in particular present themselves. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">first relates to the circumstances in which the ICO might bring a prosecution as opposed to</span>
<a name="page1094"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">relying on its civil regulatory powers. That is a question which would need to be addressed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by reference to the public interest. At the invitation of the Inquiry and following consultation,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Director of Public Prosecutions has issued guidelines for prosecutors on assessing the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest in cases affecting the media.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref61" href="#footnote61">61</a></sup> The ICO would be expected to follow these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">guidelines in the exercise of any enhanced prosecution powers and indeed in relation to its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">current powers. Mr Graham has already indicated that he is:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref62" href="#footnote62">62</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;happy to give an assurance that I will not seek to prosecute journalists who are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">genuinely pursuing enquiries in the public interest, even if those enquiries do not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ultimately bear fruit.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-106"><a href="#para2-106" name="para2-106">2.106</a></p>
 Subject to the point of generality noted above,</span> my conclusion,<span style="font-weight:normal;"> therefore, is that proper
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and proportionate enforcement of the criminal law in relation to press abuse of personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information would be enhanced by extending the prosecution powers of the ICO to include</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offences which comprehend a breach of the data protection principles in addition to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offence created by s55 of the DPA, coupled with a duty (whether formal or informal) to consult</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the CPS on such prosecutions, and the formal adoption by the ICO of the CPS guidelines on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media prosecutions.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-107"><a href="#para2-107" name="para2-107">2.107</a></p>
I recommend also that the ICO take immediate steps to engage with the Metropolitan Police
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the preparation of a long-term strategy in relation to alleged media crime with a view to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">handling the issue in the aftermath of Operations Weeting, Tuleta and Elveden, on the basis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the priority currently being given by the police to addressing this form of alleged criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behaviour is not sustainable indefinitely, and with a view to ensuring that the ICO is well</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">placed to fulfil any necessary role in this respect in future.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-108"><a href="#para2-108" name="para2-108">2.108</a></p>
 ThepositionoftheICOasprosecutoroflastresortdoesnotfullyaccountforevidentweaknesses
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in its handling of the question of criminal investigations in relation to the journalists involved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in Operation Motorman. The ICO has prosecution powers at all because it is uniquely placed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to view personal information privacy crime in the full context of its regulatory regime as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whole. This includes the perspective of the victim in such a context. That is a responsibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which it does not appear was fully engaged let alone discharged. I consider, however, that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enhancement of the prosecution powers of the ICO has a potential positively to support that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">position of overview and overall direction regarding information privacy breaches that are so</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">serious as to enter the criminal spectrum. Further, it is reasonable to conclude that it could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">help to dissolve artificial boundaries, avoid confusion of accountabilities and support a better</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">focus on the nature of the conduct and its impact on the individual.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-109"><a href="#para2-109" name="para2-109">2.109</a></p>
A final issue to be considered within the framework of formal criminal law enforcement
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is the matter of sentencing. When dealing with the criminal law generally,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref63" href="#footnote63">63</a></sup> I recommend</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the Sentencing Council of England and Wales be asked to prepare guidelines in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to information privacy and misuse offences (including computer misuse): for the sake of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">completeness, it is sufficient simply to repeat the recommendation and refer to the reasons</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">for it.</span>

<a name="page1095"></a><!--new page--><h4>Conclusions and recommendations on the legal framework</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-110"><a href="#para2-110" name="para2-110">2.110</a></p>
 The recommendations set out above are not intended to do other than provide for more
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effective enforcement of the existing principles of law as they stand, and for a fairer, more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">even handed approach to the reconciliation of existing rights within those principles in cases</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in which they may conflict. They are also intended, importantly, substantially to simplify the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">law and make it more accessible to those, that is to say both press and the public, whom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is designed to serve. There are implications in these recommendations also for the legal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system, the legal profession and the courts. Although the data protection regime is intended</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to sit lightly on businesses and not regularly to trouble the world of litigation, that is precisely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because it is explicit in the provision it makes as a matter of law; in the rare cases where it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does need to enter the legal system to resolve a disputed issue, the fundamental liberties</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with which it deals, and the sensitivity with which it deals with them need to be recognised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for what they are.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-111"><a href="#para2-111" name="para2-111">2.111</a></p>
 AsMrCoppelhaspointedout,theEuropeanCommissioniscurrentlyconsideringreplacingthe
<span style="font-size: 15px;">existing Data Protection Directive with a directly applicable regulation. The present proposed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Regulation would leave it to individual Member States to provide in detail for the exemptions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or derogations it sets out. Those include provision relating to the processing of personal data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for journalistic purposes. That means that it would be for Parliament in due course to come</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">up with a suitable formulation, within the limits of what the regulation eventually requires.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In other words, the expectation is that Parliament will have to revisit this topic in any event.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-112"><a href="#para2-112" name="para2-112">2.112</a></p>
 Itwouldbeunfortunateifthatwereregardedasreasonforlegislativeinactioninthemeantime.
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Any new regulation would itself, of course, have to make general provision within the overall</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requirement of the ECHR for a balance between Articles 8 and 10, and indeed would any UK</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">domestic legislation. The risk posed by the prospect of a new regulation that any legislation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prompted by this Report would have to be revisited seems to me in this respect to be of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">modest proportions, and to be outweighed by the need to make progress on amendment to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the 1998 Act, both as a matter of law and of policy.</span>
