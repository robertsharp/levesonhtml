<h1>CHAPTER 1<br/>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Background</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As part of an inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the press, the Terms of Reference</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extend to a consideration of the extent to which the current policy and regulatory framework</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has failed, including in relation to data protection. It also requires a review of the extent to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which there was a failure to act on previous warnings of media misconduct which undeniably</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">includes the performance of the data protection regime. Data protection, with its origins in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">European and international law, is currently contained in the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and is summarised elsewhere in the Report.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The UK data protection regime suffers from an unenviable reputation, perhaps not wholly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">merited, but nevertheless important to understand at the outset. To say that it is little known</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or understood by the public, regarded as a regulatory inconvenience in the business world,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and viewed as marginal and technical among legal practitioners (including by our higher</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">courts), might be regarded as a little unfair by the more well-informed, but is perhaps not so</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">far from the truth. And yet the subject-matter of the data protection regime, how personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information about individuals is acquired, used and traded for business purposes, could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hardly be more fundamental to issues of personal integrity, particularly in a world of ever-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accelerating information technology capability, nor, on the face of it, more central to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns of this Inquiry.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It has the following features:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) The law identifies broad principles requiring businesses acquiring and using personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information to do so lawfully, fairly, accurately, for specific purposes and to the limited</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extentnecessaryforthosepurposes;theinformationmustbekeptsafelyandindividuals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have legally enforceable rights to know what information is held about them, to see it,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and to ensure that it is accurate.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) There are a number of specific exceptions to those rights and principles, including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exemptions designed to balance those rights with other individual rights, such as</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">freedom of expression, and other public interests such as crime prevention.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) The regime (along with the regime for freedom of information) is the responsibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Information Commissioner who has statutory power to investigate and rule on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breaches, and enforce compliance (including by court action and prosecution). The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner also has a wide-ranging function to promote awareness, compliance,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and good practice over and above the basic legal requirements, including by education,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">guidance, publications and reporting to Parliament.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Successive Information Commissioners have worked hard and tirelessly to raise the profile</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of data protection within businesses, and to support public awareness, including by tackling</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;myths&#8217;andunnecessarilyrisk-aversebehaviour,andpromotingstraightforwardandcommon-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sense business practices.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">TheInformationCommissioneroperatesthroughanoffice(theICO)anditwasintheexecution</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of these responsibilities that the ICO became involved in Operation Motorman. The public</span>

 <span style="font-size: 15px;">facing narrative is described as part of the history<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> in this Report but the way in which the ICO</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered it appropriate to discharge its functions is far more complex than that narrative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reveals. Having uncovered what appeared to be extensive unlawful or unethical practices of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press in the acquisition and subsequent use of private personal information from corrupt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">officials and private sector employees and through the medium of unscrupulous third-party</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;blaggers&#8217;, a regulatory response was essential. How these challenges were approached, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political campaign that has followed and the extent to which insights can be learnt for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">future is at the heart of this Chapter.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Also looking to the future, it is appropriate to move from a consideration of the specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to consider the way in which the ICO operates in relation to the press and, in particular, to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">review the relevant parts of the legal framework along with its powers and governance.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Different parts of this Report have dealt with single systems. In relation to the activities of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press, the focus has been on the operation of the criminal law and the approach of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press Complaints Commission (PCC) to press conduct. The relationship between the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the police has been examined through the operational decisions of the police and their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interaction with the press. For politicians, the issue has been the different dynamics of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way in which they react with the press and the extent of any impact on public life. For the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO, all these different elements are engaged. This part of the Report deals with the criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">law, the regulatory regime of the ICO and the way in which it sought to engage the PCC, other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory options open to the ICO, and the political sphere (in relation to the amendment to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the DPA). It is thus somewhat more complex and, given the wide ranging recommendations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the operation of this statutory regulator with an extensive remit, has required a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">greater degree of analysis than other aspects of the Report: to that extent it is also different</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in approach.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having been directed by the Terms of Reference to consider the press and the data protection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regime together, I have been conscious that the Report would be addressing matters relatively</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">little noticed or debated in the public discussion of the Inquiry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> I am also conscious that this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subject matter has had relatively little scrutiny more generally. In this respect, as with many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent public inquiries, the task is to shine a light on an unfamiliar landscape. It is worth</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">emphasising because so much of the rest of the material considered in this Report has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extremely fully ventilated, including editorially, as the Inquiry has gone along. The extent to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">which the relevance of data protection is and has been minimised is part of the background</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to this Part of the Report, as is the question of some of the reasons and motivations for it. I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">am also conscious that the discussion of this relatively unfamiliar territory throws aspects of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it into relief in a way which may be a matter of surprise even to those more familiar with it.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A fresh and independent perspective, by definition, is an opportunity for a different way of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">looking at things and perhaps of questioning some assumptions.</span>

<h2>2. The ico: structure, governance and approach</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Information Commissioner is a &#8216;corporation sole&#8217; appointed by Her Majesty The Queen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and independent of Government who (like the senior judiciary) can only be dismissed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pursuant to an Address from both Houses of Parliament. He is funded by fees and grant-in-</span>


 <span style="font-size: 15px;">aid voted by Parliament and supported through the Lord Chancellor and Ministry of Justice.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operationally independent, the full functions of the Office are exercised personally though</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the office holder who appoints staff who work by direct delegation from him. Between 2002</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and 2009, the Commissioner was Richard Thomas, a solicitor by training. He was based in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offices in Wilmslow and had two deputies and the office now has over 300 staff (including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lawyers and investigators). The operational investigations department reported to him via</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one of the Deputies. Francis Aldhouse, also a solicitor, fulfilled this Deputy role from 1984 (in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the precursor organisations) until his retirement in 2006.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas described his approach in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) As an overview, his role was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> partly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> regulator,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> partly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> an</span><span style="font-style:italic"> ombudsman,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> partly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> an</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">educator and partly a policy adviser<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> cornerstone</span><span style="font-style:normal"> being</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> duty</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> promote</span><span style="font-style:normal"> good</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice including,<span style="font-style:italic"> but</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> limited</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span> , compliance with the minimum legal obligations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under the regime.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) The ICO was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;primarily</span> not<span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> prosecuting</span><span style="font-style:italic"> authority.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> That</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> almost</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> side&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">main formal power in the event of non-compliance was the &#8216;enforcement notice&#8217;, which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could specify and require compliance action subject to the back-up sanctions of court</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforcement, although this was not frequently used.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) The principal power of investigation was the ability to serve an &#8216;information notice&#8217; on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an organisation to ascertain whether it was complying with the regime. This also was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;very, very rarely&#8217; used because, in most cases, asking a business to co-operate and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">supply information usually sufficed.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) Prosecution powers were limited to s55 of the DPA and did not extend, for example, to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other offences such as phone hacking (although this might also technically involve a s55</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">DPA breach).</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">(e) Mr Thomas linked the application of the statutory &#8216;public interest&#8217; defence provided by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">s55 to the core function of the ICO in freedom of information, in virtually every difficult</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case, in balancing public interest considerations for and against disclosure (on which it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had published a great deal of guidance).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas did not regard the ICO as<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> regulator</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> press</span><span style="font-style:italic"> as</span><span style="font-style:italic"> such&#8221;</span> although the data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protection regime applied to each media organisation which, therefore, was regulated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and fee paying. He considered the exemption contained in s32 DPA (covering personal</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">information being used for the &#8216;special purposes&#8217; of journalism, literature or art) as severely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumscribing and limiting the powers of the ICO in relation to the press, disapplying most of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its enforcement powers where data is used for journalistic purposes while at the same time</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being &#8216;incredibly complicated&#8217;. He had rarely had to engage with the issue (because it &#8216;didn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arise&#8217;) and did not consider it particularly relevant to the Inquiry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> He considered that any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalist seeking to rely on the &#8216;public interest&#8217; provision to disapply s55 would be expected</span>





 <span style="font-size: 15px;">to be very scrupulous about checking and recording the aspects of the public interest on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which he or she was proposing to rely, in order to be able to take any available advantage of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that provision.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">From this short summary, it appeared that the ICO relied, in the main, on an informal means</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of doing business. That is usual regulatory practice. The &#8216;cornerstone&#8217; function of promoting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">good practice was largely discharged through co-operation with and encouragement of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">businesses; although little touched on in evidence, it appears that this was also the case</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the ICO&#8217;s complaint resolution or ombudsman function. It was not an organisation by its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">own account which regularly used its principal legal powers; prosecutions, in particular, were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not its main business, but neither, it would appear, was direct regulatory enforcement. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">main concern was prevention of poor practice and promotion of good practice. The Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explored the extent to which the ICO was familiar with the press as an industry dealing in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal information, and with the specific aspects of the data protection regime applying to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press, and how it saw its role in relation to commercial journalism.</span>
