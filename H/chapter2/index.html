<h1>CHAPTER 2<br/>OPERATION MOTORMAN</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. The investigation</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The background and history of Operation Motorman is fully described above<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> and does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not need repetition. When Alex Owens<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> attended the search in Operation Reproof, he was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">well aware that the data protection regime fastens on the acquisition, use and disclosure of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal data by public authorities under compulsive powers. As well as the application of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal law, the principles and rights of the regime are designed to ensure that individual civil</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">liberties are respected and safeguarded when individuals&#8217; personal information is taken into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the hands of public bodies, and that public bodies are strictly limited in terms of what can be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">done with that information and who can see it. Thus, although the focus of the police was the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question of the corruption of public officials entrusted with people&#8217;s confidential information,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the primary interest of the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO) was the information itself,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the consequences of the unlawful access and disclosure for the people whose information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was and for the organisation whose responsibility it was to take care of it.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having identified Steve Whittamore as a self-employed private detective who had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requesting details from the DVLA in relation to a protected vehicle registration number, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO undertook the initiative to obtain a search warrant under its own powers. When it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">executed, what was seized (over five-six hours) came to be referred to within the office as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a &#8216;treasure trove&#8217; or Aladdin&#8217;s cave in the form of a substantial quantity of documentation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">together with four colour-coded notebooks (&#8216;the Motorman material&#8217;). These contained a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very large amount of personal information, evidently acquired without the knowledge or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consent of the people in question.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Owens was concerned about a number of features. First was the sheer quantity of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the information and how extensive and specific it was. Second, there was the fact that it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appeared to have been obtained in the course of an investigative business spanning a period</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of years and earning considerable sums. Third, the evidence suggested that the material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been specifically requested and paid for by journalists writing for a significant range of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers and periodicals and related to a large number of well-known people (or those</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">close to them), including household names from the world of entertainment, sport, politics</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and other arenas of public life. Finally, Mr Owens was struck by the nature of the information,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including personal details from restricted databases, clearly obtained in ways which were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inconsistent with good data protection practice, with the legal rights and principles set down</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the data protection regime, and even in some cases with the criminal law. During the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">course of the search Mr Whittamore was present and although not formally interviewed, Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Owens reported (albeit speculatively) that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Whittamore made it very [clear] to me that whilst he would admit to his own wrong</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">doing, under no circumstances would he say anything which would incriminate any</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref1" name="footnote1" title="Go back to footnote reference 1 in the text">1</a>.  Part E, Chapter 3</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref2" name="footnote2" title="Go back to footnote reference 2 in the text">2</a>.

<a name="page1003"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">member of the press. I was undecided as to whether this was because he feared the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press or whether he anticipated some financial recompense in return for his silence.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Owens reported back to the senior management, briefing both Mr Thomas and Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Aldhouse. There are different recollections of discussions about the future handling of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material (which are discussed below). In the meantime, he began the laborious task of sifting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the material and arranging for it to be placed on an electronic database. Although the lead</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">came from a criminal investigation, the data protection aspects were apparent to the ICO</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the &#8216;treasure trove&#8217; they came upon taking them into a dimension of data misuse going</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">far wider than specific issues of corruption which concerned the police. In fact, it appeared</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the ICO had come upon an organised and systemic disregard for the data protection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regime of a scale, duration and seriousness going beyond poor practice, beyond breach of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principles and rights of the regime, and into the realms of criminality in its own right.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was thus no doubt that the ICO, through Mr Owens, was preparing the Motorman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material to form the basis of a prosecution under s55 DPA: they planned to prepare some 25-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">30 of the more egregious cases for detailed investigation and selective interviews in order to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">found specimen charges against a number of persons who could include (a) corrupt officials</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and employees who were providing the information to Mr Whittamore directly for money;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) blaggers, who were obtaining the information for him by deceit; and (c) the press, who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were commissioning (or &#8216;procuring&#8217; in the language of s55) the information in the first place.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In that regard, counsel subsequently advised:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Having regard to the sustained and serious nature of the journalistic involvement in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the overall picture, there can be little doubt that many, perhaps all, of the journalists</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have committed offences.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The inference, overwhelming it seems to me, is that several editors must have been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">well aware of what their staff were up to and therefore party to it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When it came to Operation Motorman, Mr Aldhouse had responsibilities which included</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">providing direction to the head of investigations at the time (and so was formally answerable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Mr Thomas for the conduct of Operation Motorman). He said that it was not his role to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">direct investigations himself; rather, he had to supervise the person running the investigations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">department.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> His own focus was on policy work, not least on the significant European</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">dimension to data protection, which often took him to Brussels.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Asked specifically about the operational issues which the discovery of the Motorman material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">raised for the ICO, Mr Aldhouse had no recollection of when he first heard about the case,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nor of any internal meetings to discuss it (including those meetings at which the investigator</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Alex Owens alleged that decisive policy positions on the operational conduct of Motorman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were taken by senior management). Mr Aldhouse himself said he never looked at the original</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Motorman material, nor the legal advice obtained by the office about it. When asked by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Counsel to the Inquiry whether there was anything in the office at the time which was as big</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or as important as Operation Motorman, Mr Aldhouse accepted that, from an operational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigations point of view, it probably was the largest investigation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> However, he firmly</span>

<a name="page1004"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">maintained a position of non-involvement and, hence, non-accountability. That exchange</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">included this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q: &#8220;I think all I&#8217;m gently suggesting, Mr Aldhouse, is this - and it&#8217;s probably fairly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">obvious now: we have possibly the most important investigation involving your office,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Operation Motorman. It has very serious ramifications. It was clearly being ramped</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">up at this stage. Mr Thomas had it in mind to make a report to Parliament shortly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">afterwards and he did. Surely you were involved, even in informal discussions with Mr</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Thomas, as to the direction your office was taking, weren&#8217;t you?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: &#8220;Well, I think they would only have been casual ones...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These answers were consistent with his brief witness statement which suggested little in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way of senior oversight of operational matters at all. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I am unable to comment on the detailed history of the Operation Motorman inquiry in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the direction of which I was not involved. I believe that the investigators conducted the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">matter together with the Commissioner&#8217;s lawyers....I regret that because of my limited</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">role in the Operation I am unable to help the Inquiry further.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Aldhouse was also asked about the senior structure in the ICO. He described a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;management team&#8217; comprising the Commissioner, two Deputies, a handful of Assistant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioners: &#8216;perhaps ten or a dozen very senior people&#8217;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> . But this team does not seem to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been engaged in any decision-making about the Motorman case, either operationally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or strategically. Was it not surprising that neither the responsible Deputy personally, nor the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisation&#8217;s senior management team, was consulted or engaged? Mr Aldhouse&#8217;s response</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">was:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Am I surprised? I&#8217;m disappointed. Not necessarily surprised. ... well, yes, I&#8217;m sure in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">retrospect it would have been - one could well say: wasn&#8217;t this big enough for the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whole of the management team to be involved? ... I certainly had views, anyway, yes.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-10"><a href="#para1-10" name="para1-10">1.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As will be clear, despite being organisationally and functionally responsible for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigations team, Mr Aldhouse placed himself at a considerable distance even from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal knowledge of the Motorman material. As Mr Thomas put it, with what appears to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be a degree of understatement,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Francis</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> somewhat</span><span style="font-style:italic"> disengaged</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> these</span><span style="font-style:italic"> matters.&#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup> Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thomas himself, however, appeared to have grasped the implications, appreciated that it was</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">very serious and congratulated Mr Owens and the team.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup> He explained that, in what was the</span>

<a name="page1005"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I was told about a &#8220;treasure trove&#8221; of evidence which the team had obtained under</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a search warrant as part of &#8216;Operation Motorman&#8217; &#8230; There was a feeling that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">material was of sufficient quality and quantity to make this a major case which would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bring home the seriousness of the [s55] offence.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-11"><a href="#para1-11" name="para1-11">1.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The assessment made by Mr Thomas of the Motorman material was that he saw it as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> hard</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">prima facie evidence ... of offences<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;,</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> on</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span><span style="font-style:normal"> scale</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> could</span><span style="font-style:normal"> hardly</span><span style="font-style:normal"> have</span><span style="font-style:normal"> been</span><span style="font-style:normal"> greater</span><span style="font-style:normal"> for</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">data protection regime. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;So my understanding, I think, remains the case that this was a far more serious matter</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">than a breach of section 55.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-12"><a href="#para1-12" name="para1-12">1.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Specifically, Mr Thomas apprehended that it was likely that that the journalists&#8217; involvement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the acquisition and use of this information took them within the sphere of conduct so</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seriously at fault as to be<span style="font-style:italic"> prima</span><span style="font-style:italic"> facie</span> criminal. Criminal conduct by journalists was the ICO&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;very,verystronghypothesis&#8217;.This understandingwastestedduring his evidence,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup> fromwhich</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it appears that the following aspects of the Motorman material were particularly striking:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) Some of the material from the protected public databases could not have been obtained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by lawful means at all, and appeared very likely to have breached specific statutory bars</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on disclosure.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) It was known that Mr Whittamore did have corrupt sources in both the public and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private sectors: these had been identified.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) The pricing structure for the commissions was indicative of criminality because they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were either too low to suggest that it had been obtained lawfully (because of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effort and time which would have been involved) or high enough positively to suggest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a premium relating either to incentivising legal risk or corruption (with some cases,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerning very well known individuals) involving very large sums.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) The circumstances suggested that it was highly likely that the journalists were knowing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or reckless as to the unlawfulness of the means by which the commissioned material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was acquired and that, on the face of it, it was unlikely that the s55 defence relating to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public interest would be available in the generality of cases.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-13"><a href="#para1-13" name="para1-13">1.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It must, of course, be appreciated that criminal proceedings are complex to mount and</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">involve a high standard of proof but, quite apart from criminality, Mr Thomas understood</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that serious questions were raised by the Motorman material and there were causes for real</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern. In his fifth witness statement, he outlined the way in which the ICO had classified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the 13,343 transactions recorded as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;(a) 5,025 identified &#8216;as transactions that were (of a type) actively investigated in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Motorman enquiry and ....positively known to constitute a breach of the DPA 1998.&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) A further 6,330 representing &#8216;transactions that are thought to have been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information obtained from telephone service providers and are likely breaches of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">DPA. However, the nature of these is not fully understood and it is for this reason that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they are considered to be probable illicit transactions&#8217;.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nature to determine whether they represent illicit transactions or otherwise.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-14"><a href="#para1-14" name="para1-14">1.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas then put the matter in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The classification of the transactions related to the apparent commission of offences</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8230; But I suggest that there must be at the very least ethical questions where a journalist</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is the regular customer of an investigator who commits an offence to obtain the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information, whether or not the journalist has also committed a procuring offence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in relation to that transaction. Such ethical questions are even more pertinent where</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8230; the investigator could obtain the information &#8220;more quickly and reliably than they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">[the journalists] were able to&#8221;, at least some of the information was of a confidential</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nature and Mr Whittamore was pressing to sell other pieces of information obtained</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for other clients.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-15"><a href="#para1-15" name="para1-15">1.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas was in no doubt that a significant proportion of the Motorman material did indeed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">constitute evidence of criminality, particularly in contravening specific bars on the disclosure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of material from databases under the control of public authorities. As for the possibility of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">defence under s55 DPA, he said, for example, that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> haven&#8217;t</span><span style="font-style:italic"> seen</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> whiff</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> public</span><span style="font-style:italic"> interest.</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It was tittle-tattle. It was fishing. There may be one or two examples, but they would be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">exceptional.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-16"><a href="#para1-16" name="para1-16">1.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He also made two further points. First, the theoretical availability of material by lawful and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fair means did not by itself render innocuous the acquisition of material by other means</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which did, in fact, constitute breaches of the data protection regime. Secondly, at the very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">least, most of the material in question was not reasonably to be regarded as in the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">domain, and therefore had a quality of confidentiality.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-17"><a href="#para1-17" name="para1-17">1.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have no doubt that this analysis is both important and valid. It was for that reason that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I took the view that it was both appropriate and correct that Mr Owens should produce</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Motorman material to the Inquiry but that (given the privacy of those whose records</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been mined), it should be seen by the core participants under strict confidentiality and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should remain in redacted form.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup> Having said that, I summarised the effect of the evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It&#8217;s abundantly clear, looking at the electronic records, which you&#8217;ve checked against</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the actual documents, that Mr Whittamore had collected together a vast amount of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">personal data. The documents identify the names of titles and specific journalists at the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">titles apparently or inferentially making the request. It identifies the names of people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from a wide range of public life and in the public eye, and provides addresses, telephone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">numbers, mobile telephone numbers and charging details for that information. It&#8217;s not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">necessary to go into the identity of the individuals, &#8230; it&#8217;s not necessary otherwise to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">identify titles or names and certainly not necessary to identify the persons who were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the targets of enquiry. In relation to some of them, it is absolutely right that there may</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">well be a public interest justification in the enquiry. In relation to others, however, it</span>

<a name="page1007"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is difficult, if not impossible, to see what public interest justification there could be.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-18"><a href="#para1-18" name="para1-18">1.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A further point that Mr Thomas made was to recognise the possibility that the Motorman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material was representative in nature. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I have always recognised that the material seized in Operation Motorman came</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">only from one group of investigators and may have been entirely isolated. Equally,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">many other private investigators were known to be active and it is difficult to believe</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the investigators raided by the ICO were the only ones with press clients. This view is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">strengthened by the quite separate Goodman / Mulcaire prosecutions which came to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">light after the first ICO report and which had parallels with the section 55 offences and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reinforced the evidence gathered during Operation Motorman.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-19"><a href="#para1-19" name="para1-19">1.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This identifies the general awareness of, and concern about, the security of confidential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">databases in both the public and private sectors, the sensitivity of the concentration in those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">databases of very large amounts of personal data, and the risks of that getting into the wrong</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hands.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup> Albeit retrospectively, Mr Thomas also made the connection between the Motorman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material and the subsequent evidence of phone hacking undertaken within the press<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup> as did</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Owens.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup> In any event, however, there was a clear apprehension of a general problem</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerning unlawful and unethical trading in personal information, including, but not limited</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to, the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-20"><a href="#para1-20" name="para1-20">1.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In sum, therefore, Mr Thomas, and the ICO more generally, was aware that the Motorman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence was an indication, in relation to the culture, practices and ethics of the press and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">beyond, of conduct that was likely to be criminal, probably constituted systematic breaches</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of confidentiality, privacy and the principles and rights of the data protection regime, was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">certainly unethical, and was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;quite</span><span style="font-style:italic"> outrageous</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> policy</span><span style="font-style:italic"> terms&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup> As summarised in the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the operational decisions made about Motorman; effectively, he disclaimed significant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contemporaneous knowledge of the operational management of the case. It is also striking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, as Mr Thomas was aware, his Deputy, Mr Aldhouse, also distanced himself from the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">October 2003 advising that there were grounds in the Motorman evidence for proceeding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">against journalists,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup> or that the judge hearing the Motorman prosecutions at Blackfriars had</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I must admit to being surprised about the extent to which Mr Thomas distanced himself</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the practical details of the operation that was later to take up so much of his attention</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politically. By his own account he did not direct the operational strategy, involve himself in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">key decisions or, it would seem, keep himself especially closely briefed. One of the earliest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">notes of his reaction was a handwritten entry in a personal notebook<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup> written between 3 and</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest in the press dimension to Operation Motorman. But he remained firm: he personally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not give any serious consideration to the operational dimension. He &#8216;assumed&#8217; that an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operational decision would be taken at the level of Mr Owens and the in-house legal team,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about whether and to what extent to pursue action against the press. Put to him that he must</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at least have been aware that no journalist was being prosecuted, that he must at least have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been alert to the criminal process, he replied that that was only in very general terms. There</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were, he pointed out, &#8216;many, many other matters going on at that time&#8217;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref38" href="#footnote38">38</a></sup></span>

<a name="page1009"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It was my understanding that the case would be pursued in line with established Office</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">practice &#8211; prosecutions led by the in-house legal team, advising and acting upon the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">evidence obtained by the Investigations Unit. I was subsequently kept broadly abreast</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of developments, notably that the CPS were taking over the prosecutions [this is, of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">private investigators] and then that trial had resulted in major disappointment. The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ICO lawyer with lead responsibility was Phil Taylor.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Motorman material had emerged in the course of a criminal investigation, but its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">implications for the data protection regime were much broader than that. There is no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indication, however, that aspects other than prosecution were actively being considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within the ICO. It is difficult on the face of it to understand why not: that question is considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in some detail below.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both in law and in terms of the reputation of the ICO, operational decisions, especially any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involving the press, would have been complex and significant, and Mr Thomas was ultimately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accountable for them. Motorman was not a simple operational issue: it was an indication of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">data protection breaches and poor practice on an unprecedentedly large scale and driven by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the newspaper industry. It obviously engaged the ICO functionally and could have reputational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consequences. In addition to criminal proceedings, there was a spectrum of powers and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">functions which, at any rate potentially, could be engaged, in different combinations. These</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are considered in more detail below. Given the inherent risks in criminal proceedings,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contingency planning was also in question. In other words, there were<span style="font-style:italic"> strategic</span> decisions to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be taken in considering the<span style="font-style:italic"> operational</span> response to Motorman which could only be taken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effectively at the level of strategic overview. However those in a position to take that strategic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">overview of operations emphasised to the Inquiry that they were not doing so.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition to operational responses there were political possibilities and it is these that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thomas focused on. His strategy was to take a twin-track approach, consisting of initiating a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dialogue with the Press Complaints Commission and undertaking a campaign to persuade the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">government to change the law to introduce custodial sentence maxima for s55 of the Act. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some ways, Mr Thomas characterised this as in itself an operational response:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think we were using our powers to promote good practice. That was a far more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">general power, and you know, that was the justification, the rationale &#8211; the statutory</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">foundation for much of what we did was promoting good practice. I would describe</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pretty well everything we did in this area as promoting good practice.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There were, however, risks in the extent to which the most senior staff were at a distance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the specifics of the operational response to Motorman. The first was that the strategic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach adopted would be insufficiently informed by detailed operational knowledge and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understanding of the problem revealed. The Motorman material was a very rich resource</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of empirical evidence of the nature and scale of the presenting problem, and any strategic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">solution was likely to have been importantly enriched by expert analysis of that information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the context of the industry in question. The second risk was that the political and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operational responses would be insufficiently well co-ordinated for the maximisation of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effectiveness of each. Decisions made in one context might well be capable of affecting the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other at least at a handling level. Mutual knowledge and understanding would be important</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resources for both. Finally, the third risk was that if the top of the office did not sufficiently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">communicate with or engage the operational part of the office about the political strategy,</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref41" name="footnote41" title="Go back to footnote reference 41 in the text">41</a>.  p25, lines 3-9, Richard Thomas, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-9-December-2011.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1010"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">operational decisions might be taken on the basis of weak knowledge or assumptions about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the operational implications of the political strategy.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As for the distance that Mr Thomas kept from operational decision-making in Motorman, he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">put his own frame of mind in embarking on his twin-track political strategy in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;My speculation is when I was told some time in October or November [of 2003] that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it was going to be too expensive or too difficult to pursue the journalists, that&#8217;s when I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">went off to the Press Complaints Commission. But throughout that period from March</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to October, as far as I was concerned, it was being handled in what I can broadly call</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the normal way by those who were charged with enforcing Section 55.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This speculation does not seem to be strictly accurate. At the time, with the assistance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Counsel, the investigations officers evidently continued actively to consider the possibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of criminal proceedings in relation to the press. The availability of civil investigation and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforcement powers also fell to be considered in the alternative in any event. In other words,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Motorman, remained a live operational issue for the ICO at the time Mr Thomas embarked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on his political strategy; there were therefore risks both to it and to his own plans.</span>

<a name="section3"></a>
<h2>3. The approach to the PCC</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas was clear that it was his personal decision to approach the PCC;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup> this was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reinforced by his Deputy, Mr Aldhouse. In oral evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Aldhouse said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I do recall that Richard Thomas decided that he wanted to pursue the route of going</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the Press Complaints Commission and writing to Sir Christopher Meyer, but I have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to say I think that was Richard Thomas&#8217;s decision rather than the result of some</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">discussion.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Pressed as to whether he would not have expected, as Deputy, to have been involved, he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said he would, but he was &#8216;otherwise engaged&#8217;, including in Brussels. Although Mr Aldhouse</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">saw his own role as somewhat dissociated, given the policy ramifications that the Motorman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case might throw up and the potential cost implications for the ICO, when asked whether it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was strange that he was not at least involved quite closely in discussions with Mr Thomas, his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">response was:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;What can I say? It&#8217;s for the Commissioner to decide how he runs the office. If - and it is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">worth bearing in mind, of course, that it is - that the Commissioner is a one-man band</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and if the Commissioner decides to take a route, so be it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the event, on 4 November 2003, Mr Thomas wrote personally to the Chairman of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC, then Sir Christopher Meyer.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup> He explained that his idea had been to &#8216;go collectively&#8217;</span>

<a name="page1011"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">rather than individually to the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup> This gives rise to a number of issues. First, what his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understanding of the role and functions of the PCC was (and how that developed); second, to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what extent he understood the PCC to be a representative of the press collectively and to what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extent a regulator of the press (two very different propositions); and third, how he judged the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO and PCC would relate to each other functionally and how he managed that relationship.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The resolution of these leads to the overarching question about the objectives in approaching</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC, whether they were appropriate and how effectively were they achieved.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In relation to his approach and objectives, Mr Thomas was looking at these at a high level and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generic nature which was some distance from the immediate operational issues faced by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO. He did not have it in mind to ask the PCC to investigate the specifics of the Motorman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material or the conduct of the press (although he does not appear to have resolved how</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an investigation would be handled if at all within the ICO). He wanted a general, forward-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">looking exercise, conducted across the industry as a whole, with a view to putting a halt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the practice of commissioning unscrupulous private investigators to obtain confidential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal information without regard to whether means such as blagging and corruption</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were used. He considered that this would principally be achieved by issuing a prominent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and general condemnation of the practice and securing appropriate changes to the Editors&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Code.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup> There is, however, no clear indication of how Mr Thomas thought condemnation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the PCC and changes to the Code would definitively terminate the practice, nor of what,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if any, complementary action would be necessary or desirable on the ICO&#8217;s part to achieve</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that result.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas was also concerned about the tone of his approach. He wanted to make a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;constructive and friendly&#8217;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref49" href="#footnote49">49</a></sup> overture to the senior leadership of the PCC. He evidently had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in mind that a &#8216;good relationship&#8217;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup> would be important. There was to be an element of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">outreach and informality, so lunch meetings were contemplated, Mr Thomas would attend</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the PCC so far as location was concerned (a concession inevitably constrained by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">location of his premises in Cheshire), and formal or agreed notes were not expected. In other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">words, Mr Thomas intended to conduct the relationship himself, at a personal level and in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal manner.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The letter<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">51</a></sup> drew attention to a recommendation of the Parliamentary Culture, Media and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sport Select Committee that the Editors&#8217; Code should be amended to include explicit bans on</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">payments to the police for information and on the use and payment of intermediaries such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as private detectives. The letter outlined the Motorman findings and the Metropolitan Police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigations. It stressed the considerable volume of material uncovered; the indication that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists from most newspapers and many periodicals were customers of Mr Whittamore;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that numerous journalists routinely obtained confidential information that &#8216;they should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have no access to&#8217;. It suggested that this material was being obtained in the service of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">celebrity gossip, not to expose wrong-doing, and that the sums involved and the nature of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the documentation made it &#8216;difficult to believe that senior managers were not aware of what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was going on, and were therefore at least tacitly condoning it&#8217;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The letter also indicated that the ICO was considering whether to take action under the DPA</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">against individual journalists and/or newspapers. It was put to Mr Thomas by the Inquiry that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this was an empty threat; he resisted the idea that it was a threat of any sort, on the basis that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he intended the letter to be a &#8216;constructive and friendly opening in my engagement with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press Complaints Commission&#8217; but he did accept that &#8216;it may have been somewhat overstating</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the case&#8217;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref52" href="#footnote52">52</a></sup> It suggested however that the ICO had provisionally concluded that it would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate first to give the PCC and its Code Committee the prior opportunity to &#8216;deal with&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the issue in a way which would put a stop to the &#8216;deplorable&#8217; practices across the media as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whole. It envisaged that the ICO would provide some of the Motorman material to the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that the PCC would respond with a suitable change to the Code; this could provide a more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">satisfactory outcome than &#8216;legal proceedings&#8217; and would also, it was suggested, be consistent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Sir Christopher Meyer&#8217;s wish expressed to the Select Committee to demonstrate the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effectiveness of the PCC.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the light of all that has been said about the PCC, it is significant that the letter addresses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the relationship between the ICO and the PCC as Mr Thomas saw it. Intending to discuss the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship, he said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I believe it would be to our mutual advantage to meet at an early opportunity to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">discuss the matters raised in this letter and, more generally, our respective roles and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the relationship between our organisations.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He also indicated that:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;though I do not wish to usurp your role as the regulator of the press - newspapers,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and their employees, are subject to the Data Protection Act 1998.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref54" href="#footnote54">54</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas was surely correct to suggest that the respective roles and responsibilities of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the two organisations, namely the statutory data protection regulator and the industry&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voluntary body, would be an important issue. The obvious asymmetry made it so. The ICO</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had legal functions and duties to be discharged in relation to the matter of how businesses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acquired and used individuals&#8217; information; the PCC did not. It is inevitable therefore that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thomas&#8217;s approach would have had to have been at the level of seeking to elicit the voluntary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cooperation of the PCC rather than making a claim on any complementary or overlapping</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">formal legal jurisdiction.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-10"><a href="#para3-10" name="para3-10">3.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas&#8217;s letter suggested a meeting within days at the offices of the PCC; he approached</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">that meeting in a structured way, preparing a speaking note<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref55" href="#footnote55">55</a></sup> setting out his evident hope</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the PCC would respond with a &#8216;general condemnation&#8217; and changes to the Editors&#8217; Code.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The meeting took place on 27 November 2003, Sir Christopher was accompanied by Guy</span>

<a name="page1013"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The PCC would like time to consider their response. They were clearly surprised by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the scale and nature of the material we have collected and see this as a &#8216;watershed&#8217; in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">terms of this sort of activity.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Although this was not suggested by us, they would be resistant to &#8216;taking over&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">individual cases and taking action in each case instead of us. Their starting point</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was that statutory bodies should enforce the law, not them. But they seemed to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">increasingly ready as the meeting progressed to work with us as &#8216;fellow regulators&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with a strategic response. This might lead to some sort of general condemnation and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; though there are some difficulties &#8211; an amendment to the Code.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It is for them to identify precisely what they might do, and they recognise this. They</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">want a second meeting before Christmas.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-12"><a href="#para3-12" name="para3-12">3.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is somewhat surprising that Mr Thomas appears to have seen a measure of equivalence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between the roles of the ICO and the PCC, if not actually of deference to the latter. In oral</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence he explained that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> think</span><span style="font-style:italic"> we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> were</span><span style="font-style:italic"> both</span><span style="font-style:italic"> very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> proud</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> independence,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I&#8217;m</span><span style="font-style:italic"> sure&#8221;</span> ,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref58" href="#footnote58">58</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;What are you relying on as concluding that the Press Complaints Commission was a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regulator? You&#8217;re a regulator, but you&#8217;ve concluded here that they&#8217;re a regulator, or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">asserted that they&#8217;re a regulator. I&#8217;m just interested to investigate your understanding</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">of that.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-13"><a href="#para3-13" name="para3-13">3.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The response from Mr Thomas was that the PCC called themselves a &#8216;self-regulatory body&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and confirmed that at that point he certainly saw them as such; and therefore as likely to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be &#8216;intelligence-driven, proactive, mainly focused on either prevention or punishment&#8217;. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had drawn parallels with the Advertising Standards Authority and the banking and insurance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ombudsman schemes with which he was familiar from his previous career, and saw the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as, like the ASA, able to intervene and take action to prevent unacceptable behaviour. It was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with that expectation that he had approached Sir Christopher. The PCC was &#8216;supposed to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in charge of the press, they ought to know what&#8217;s going on&#8217;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup> and, indeed, to stop it.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-14"><a href="#para3-14" name="para3-14">3.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas accepts now that this was a misconception. In oral evidence to the Inquiry he</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">confirmed that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref61" href="#footnote61">61</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I did see them and they held themselves out as a regulator and I think experience</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">showed that they were not a regulator in the conventional sense.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He went so far as to suggest that the inadequacy of the PCC to the task he had envisaged for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it formed a part of the dialogue:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref62" href="#footnote62">62</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I can recall saying, you know, &#8216;Why can&#8217;t you transform and change the Press</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Complaints Commission to make it look more like the effective self-regulation models</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">I&#8217;ve encountered elsewhere?&#8217;&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">HiscurrentunderstandingwasthatthePCCwasessentiallyacomplaintshandler,withfunctions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">focused on the investigation of complaints from the public. That leads to the question of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">steps he might have taken to ascertain the position at the outset, or as his understanding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the PCC developed over time, not least bearing in mind his express placing the question</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the relationship between the two bodies on the agenda at that original meeting. This is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important because the assumption of equivalence (or deference) with which he mistakenly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">embarked on the initiative with the PCC could have had direct implications for decisions the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO might otherwise have made about the exercise of its own powers and functions. That, as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">well as Mr Thomas&#8217; personal distance from the operational issues raised for his office by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Motorman data, put him in an unsatisfactory position in embarking on this enterprise.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-16"><a href="#para3-16" name="para3-16">3.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, although the initial letter expressly put the question of respective roles and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationships on the agenda for discussion with the PCC, it is evident that the opportunity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not in fact taken to clarify that fundamental question. Mr Thomas was specifically asked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether the role of the PCC was described and his perception discussed and corrected.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref63" href="#footnote63">63</a></sup> His</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">response was that over the course of his interactions with Sir Christopher &#8216;we&#8217;ve probably</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">touched on some of these matters&#8217;. Given the significance that Mr Thomas attached to this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach that cannot, in the circumstances, be considered a satisfactory basis on which the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO, as a statutory regulator, ought to have made any decisions about respective roles and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibilities. The likely explanation for (and consequences of) this is considered below.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-17"><a href="#para3-17" name="para3-17">3.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">SirChristopher&#8217;sownaccountofthatfirstmeetingwasmorehighlycoloured.Hewasevidently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interested in what he heard about Motorman: he characterised the ICO as describing a &#8216;fairly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apocalyptic situation&#8217;,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref64" href="#footnote64">64</a></sup> leading them to expect court action in relation to the press (which did</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not materialise), but principally in getting to the data underlying the issue:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref65" href="#footnote65">65</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I wanted beef. I wanted red meat, Mr Jay, and he didn&#8217;t give it to me.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This, on his account, would have enabled the PCC to &#8216;have gone into some kind of action with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the newspapers in question&#8217; and to sharpen and hone their guidance to the press. In the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">light of the way in which Sir Christopher dealt with Operation Caryatid, it is not obvious what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might have been done but, although his letter had held out the prospect of some limited</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disclosure of material, Mr Thomas was clear in his own mind that his purpose was not to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ask the PCC to investigate individual cases. In any event, the PCC was equally clear that they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could not look at cases from unidentified victims: this could have been a clue as to the PCC&#8217;s</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">quintessentially complaint-handling function.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-18"><a href="#para3-18" name="para3-18">3.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Christopher&#8217;s appetite for beef, therefore, was evidently related at least in part to seeing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the proof of the message he was being given. Pressed as to whether the PCC could not simply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have taken on trust the ICO&#8217;s indication of the extent of the problem without the underlying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">data, Sir Christopher&#8217;s answer was that while of course it could be assumed Mr Thomas would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not have made the allegations without some substance, they never saw the substance or the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expected litigation.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-20"><a href="#para3-20" name="para3-20">3.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The refusal of the PCC to take any action while criminal proceedings were pending or possible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was also made plain;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref68" href="#footnote68">68</a></sup> this was a position which Mr Thomas on his part made very clear he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not accept, but from which the PCC refused to move. The message from Sir Christopher,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in other words, was that the Motorman evidence was ICO business rather than for the PCC;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they were prepared to help as far as they could, but needed more to go on.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref69" href="#footnote69">69</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-21"><a href="#para3-21" name="para3-21">3.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The reaction (that the PCC wanted details of the underlying data and decisive action from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO before it could act) continued to set the tone and might be viewed as an early warning of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the extent to which the PCC was either unwilling or unable to deliver what Mr Thomas hoped</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to achieve. It might (but did not) cause a reconsideration of his investment in the twin-track</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strategy of approaching the PCC and the government, but without at the same time attending</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">closely to the operational response itself.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-22"><a href="#para3-22" name="para3-22">3.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A year passed with little progress. Mr Thomas described the joint effort to produce a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">guidance note as seeming to<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;sort</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> grind</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> halt</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> April</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> 2004&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref70" href="#footnote70">70</a></sup> He wrote to the PCC on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">8 December of that year expressing concern that the work had &#8216;run into the sand&#8217;,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref71" href="#footnote71">71</a></sup> and that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was consequently a real risk that the problematic practices would continue unabated.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This comment is particularly significant because if the ICO apprehended that there was a real</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">risk of continuing unlawful conduct after the Motorman seizure there was again no indication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this was the subject of any reassessment, either of the PCC strategy itself or of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operational response and options within the ICO. A whole year had elapsed since the first</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach to the PCC, two years since the seizure of the Motorman material. These were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potentially very serious matters, and the PCC strategy had yet to bear any fruit. Mr Thomas</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained that he did not &#8216;lose all faith&#8217;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref72" href="#footnote72">72</a></sup> In the circumstances, the basis of that faith and his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">continued reliance on it are increasingly hard to understand.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-23"><a href="#para3-23" name="para3-23">3.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both sides appear to have thought that the matter had become bogged down in legal details,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including over the matter of the effect of the public interest exemption in s55 of the DPA in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to actual or potential criminal liability of journalists. Mr Thomas put it to the PCC</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">in his letter that he was strongly of the view that inaction on their part would show the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;principles of self-regulation in a poor light&#8217;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref73" href="#footnote73">73</a></sup> If his intention was to suggest either that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC risked its own credibility politically, or that the industry risked direct regulatory action</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the ICO, there is no evidence that Mr Thomas had any particular basis for making such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a suggestion.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 15 December 2004, Sir Christopher replied<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref74" href="#footnote74">74</a></sup> indicating that he was going to<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;resurrect&#8221;</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the project with a view to approving a note the following February. He made it clear, however,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the key objective of the note from the point of view of the PCC was to assist journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in understanding how to comply with the DPA: that would be &#8216;most welcome&#8217;. A very brief</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was issued (&#8216;probably in the spring of 2005&#8217;)<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref75" href="#footnote75">75</a></sup> but evidently with little impact; it contained no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reference to Operation Motorman and no warning to journalists.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref76" href="#footnote76">76</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-25"><a href="#para3-25" name="para3-25">3.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In evidence, Tim Toulmin (then the Director of the PCC) agreed that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;there</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> no</span><span style="font-style:italic"> attempt</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by the PCC in 2005, through its guidance, specifically to warn the press of what they should</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">do in the future by reference to what they might have done in the past.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref77" href="#footnote77">77</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> His</span><span style="font-style:normal"> view</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that,</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given that the PCC was &#8216;a complaints body looking at breaches of the code of practice rather</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than the Data Protection Act&#8217;, there was some question about whether it should even have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issued the note it did, but &#8216;it did want to be helpful&#8217;. The PCC had regarded it as &#8216;pretty much</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">outside its remit&#8217; and required a specific decision from its board to proceed with the matter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at all. Mr Toulmin also agreed with the proposition that the PCC&#8217;s view was:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Well,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> there</span><span style="font-style:italic"> isn&#8217;t</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a specific complaint here, therefore our powers aren&#8217;t engaged and we&#8217;re only going to take</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">second place to the Information Commissioner, who is the real regulator in this area&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref78" href="#footnote78">78</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-26"><a href="#para3-26" name="para3-26">3.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Toulmin also said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref79" href="#footnote79">79</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The question was, I think, where the different responsibilities lay. The PCC, as a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">platform for discussing the behaviour of journalists and so on in another context, which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was about the application of the code of practice, was happy also to say, &#8220;By the way,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Richard Thomas has this campaign about the Data Protection Act and he&#8217;s right to do</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">so&#8221;, but beyond that, it was difficult really to know what the PCC could do.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">His conclusion was that Mr Thomas should have engaged directly with the industry, the trade</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bodies or straight to the Code Committee (as being &#8216;more representative of the industry&#8217;)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and not to the PCC at all: it did not have the right remit.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref80" href="#footnote80">80</a></sup> Throughout this period, however,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was still no evidence that the ICO was either successfully managing the relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the PCC towards its stated objectives, or assessing the alternatives.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-27"><a href="#para3-27" name="para3-27">3.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The next step was the publication by the ICO of<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref81" href="#footnote81">81</a></sup> on 10 May 2006; the ICO</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">included the PCC in its distribution list. A response (described with conscious understatement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by Mr Thomas as &#8220;disappointing&#8221;) came on 31 May in a form acknowledged by Sir Christopher</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a bit &#8220;sneering&#8221;. It was in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref82" href="#footnote82">82</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Thank you for sending me a copy of your report, What Price Privacy? It was an</span>

<a name="page1017"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think that, as a next step, it would be helpful if we organised a meeting so that we can</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">explore what more it is that you think the PCC can do. You will appreciate that your call</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for us to act came rather out of the blue, and we have no material to work with other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">than what you put into the public domain in your report.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Perhaps someone in your office could be in touch ... to arrange a suitable time.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-28"><a href="#para3-28" name="para3-28">3.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The enclosed speech was largely a celebration of the achievements of the PCC, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">immediately before closing with the claim that &#8216;15 years of the PCC has changed the culture</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of an entire industry&#8217;, dealt with the ICO in two short paragraphs which strongly suggested</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it had reached the limits of the action it was prepared to take:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref83" href="#footnote83">83</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There is one issue not touched on in the Report which merits an observation. Recently,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Information Commissioner, Richard Thomas, wrote to me, as he did to members</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the newspaper and magazine industries, about the suborning of people by agencies</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">paid by publications to obtain confidential information. This is something that I have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">intermittently discussed with Mr. Thomas over the last two years or so. It was as a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">result of our exchanges that the PCC published last year, in collaboration with the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Information Commissioner&#8217;s office, an advice note to journalists about the Data</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Protection Act and how it impinged on their profession.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Part of the purpose of the note was to remind journalists that offering money for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">confidential information, either directly or through third parties, was illegal. Mr.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Thomas is clearly concerned that this is a practice which continues. He would like the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">PCC to do something more about it. I intend to tell him once again that we can and do</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">urge on journalists respect for the law &#8211; bribery has no place in journalism. I will go on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">urging. And I look forward to discussions with Mr. Thomas about what more he thinks</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the PCC can do about this within the self-regulatory framework. But clearly it would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not be viable simply to duplicate the criminal law in the Code of Practice<span style="font-style:normal"> .&#8221;</span></span>

<p id="para-id-3-29"><a href="#para3-29" name="para3-29">3.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This did not prompt a reassessment of the strategy, but, on 13 July, a further meeting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between Mr Thomas and Sir Christopher took place. The ICO note of the meeting<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref84" href="#footnote84">84</a></sup> identified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as key issues the PCC response to<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy?</span> , support so far and next steps, along</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with &#8216;the respective roles and responsibilities of the PCC and the code of practice committee</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of editors&#8217;. Sir Christopher was reported to have said that &#8216;the PCC is not able to act as a</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">general regulator. He believes that what is needed is a strong stance from the ICO including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecutions. He queried what more the PCC could do.&#8217; The ICO considered that the PCC&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">role was to come up with proposals on raising awareness to help prevent misconduct, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seemed to consider in turn that there was little more that the ICO could be expected to do.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Christopher encouraged the ICO<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> engage</span><span style="font-style:italic"> directly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> industry&#8221;</span> and Tim Toulmin</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stressed the need for the PCC to act &#8216;with the consent from industry&#8217; in the matter of issuing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">guidance, and also recommended direct engagement with the industry.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-30"><a href="#para3-30" name="para3-30">3.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of action points were recorded for the meeting. These were:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) the Code of Practice Committee of Editors was to be engaged by the ICO and the PCC to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discuss the possibility of changes to the Code and production of guidance;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) the PCC was to give thought to the production of question and answer style guidance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">separate of the Code;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) the PCC was to continue to condemn the illegal obtaining of confidential personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information by journalists; and</span>

<a name="page1018"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) the PCC was to provide the ICO with a formal response to the recommendations in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">report.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-31"><a href="#para3-31" name="para3-31">3.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The disappointment felt by Mr Thomas with the response of the PCC remains keenly felt in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his oral testimony.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref85" href="#footnote85">85</a></sup> He was exasperated with the PCC&#8217;s line:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref86" href="#footnote86">86</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;[&#8230;]Coming back all the time: &#8220;What do you want us to do? Tell us exactly what to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">do.&#8221; My line was: &#8220;Well, you are the self-regulators. You&#8217;re the ones supposed to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">working out what is needed to stop the press getting into unacceptable territory. It&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not my job to tell you what your job is.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-32"><a href="#para3-32" name="para3-32">3.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Christopher&#8217;s account of this meeting also evinced a certain amount of exasperation also:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref87" href="#footnote87">87</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I was sort of repeating the same message like a parrot: where&#8217;s the beef? For Pete&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sake &#8211; you know, we can do general exhortation, we can do guidance, we can do this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">stuff, but if you really want me to home in on miscreants, I must have some evidence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of who has been procuring enquiry agents &#8211; or hiring enquiry agents to procure</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information illegally, and he was unwilling to do that.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Asked what he might have meant by saying that the PCC was unable to act as a general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator, Sir Christopher said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref88" href="#footnote88">88</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think what I had in mind there was a notion that we should in some way take on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the work of the Information Commissioner by virtue of being a Press Complaints</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Commission, and this is what I wanted to reject. The point I always made to Mr Thomas,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">apart from my insistent demands on beef, was to suggest that we had to work in a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">complementary way. He did his thing, but there were things that we could do to help</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">him, and I&#8217;ve described them...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-33"><a href="#para3-33" name="para3-33">3.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not the function of this part of the Report to analyse the response of the PCC on its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">own account;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref89" href="#footnote89">89</a></sup> rightly or wrongly, however, the PCC had unmistakably demonstrated that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was unwilling or unable to take action of a sort which could or should have convinced the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO that the problems with the culture, practices and ethics of the press evidenced in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Motorman material had been definitively addressed by the industry for the future. It had also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">demonstrated a challenge back to the ICO to address the situation through the discharge of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its own powers and functions, and specifically by direct engagement with the industry.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-34"><a href="#para3-34" name="para3-34">3.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The result is that it was evident that the strategy adopted by Mr Thomas (dialogue with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC, and distance from both from the operational choices of his office and from direct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">engagement with the regulated members of the industry) was becoming increasingly unlikely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to achieve its aims. Whether Mr Thomas considered himself to be dealing with an ineffective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry regulator, or with a recalcitrant representative body of the industry itself, the onus</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was clearly firmly on the ICO to reflect further on the direction that it wished to take with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Motorman evidence. No such reconsideration appears to have taken place. Nor is it clear that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ICO explained to the PCC either its position or its operational approach.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Doubtless in the hope of making progress, in accordance with the action points from the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">fixed for 21 September. In the meantime, there was a &#8216;formal response&#8217; from the PCC to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effect that the ICO should take up the question of Code amendment directly with the Code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Committee and that the PCC would await the outcome of that process before turning its mind</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">back to the issue of guidance<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref90" href="#footnote90">90</a></sup> . Mr Thomas later described himself as having been &#8220;fobbed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">off&#8221; to the Code Committee by Sir Christopher.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref91" href="#footnote91">91</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-36"><a href="#para3-36" name="para3-36">3.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Notably, the question of a response by the PCC was now &#8216;complicated&#8217; by the fact that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then Department for Constitutional Affairs, had issued a consultation paper (picking up from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">What Price Privacy?<span style="font-style:normal"> )</span><span style="font-style:normal"> relating</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> introduction</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> custodial</span><span style="font-style:normal"> penalties</span><span style="font-style:normal"> for</span><span style="font-style:normal"> conviction</span><span style="font-style:normal"> under</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">s55 of the DPA. In other words, at this point, if not earlier, the strategy around the approach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the PCC became inextricably entwined with the political campaign which was the second</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">limb of the ICO response to the Motorman material. In relation to this campaign, the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unambiguously positioned itself not as a regulator of the industry but as a champion of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view opposing any legislative change: it did so by active political lobbying (not least through</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Guy Black). The twin tracks of Mr Thomas&#8217;s approach effectively became one. It is to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political campaign that it is now appropriate to turn.</span>

<h2>4.<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy?</span>  The political campaign</h2>

<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Any new statutory regime can take time to bed down in practice and a regulator created by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statute will be in the best position to report on its practical operation. In relation to the DPA,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ICO had two channels for doing so. The first was to do so informally to the sponsoring</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">government department with policy responsibility,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref92" href="#footnote92">92</a></sup> the second was to do so formally by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reporting directly to Parliament either generally on the exercise of its functions under the Act</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or on specific aspects of those functions.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref93" href="#footnote93">93</a></sup> It was this second channel which had been used in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the case of the<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy?</span> Reports.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Reporting on effectiveness of legislation is not the same as campaigning to change it. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">duties of the ICO under the DPA focus on performance of statutory functions<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref94" href="#footnote94">94</a></sup> and do not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">themselves very obviously provide the platform from which to mount such a campaign.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Clearly, the general desirability of a statutory regulator undertaking such a role is a matter of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">judgment on which I do not express an opinion but a number of issues do fall to be considered.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first is the risk that a political campaign might impact on the principal function of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator such as the ICO, that is to say, the discharge of regulatory obligations which must</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be undertaken independently, impartially, fairly and objectively, and many of them in a quasi-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">judicial fashion. As a matter of law, therefore, any campaign should raise no issue, whether as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a matter of fact or of perception, which could cast any doubt on the proper conduct of those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">functions. In that regard, it is relevant that the ICO exercises regulatory functions in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Government itself both as users of personal information and therefore subject to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ordinary data protection regime but also of course as the single largest collective subject of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the freedom of information regime. The Information Commissioner would obviously have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be circumspect in relation to any campaign for change in data protection law and, when</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the enhancement of its role and functions.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second issue relates to the choice of the topic on which to campaign. S55 creates a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal offence with statutory defences and a maximum sentence on conviction of a fine.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref95" href="#footnote95">95</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Yet Mr Thomas had said that the ICO was not principally a prosecuting authority. In most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory regimes, criminal provisions usually constitute a measure of last resort, dealing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with situations either of egregious breach for which no other response is appropriate, or for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">persistent and escalating breach where other, stepped, interventions have been tried without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">success. Criminal prosecution is complex and expensive. The deterrent effect of differential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">maximum sentences is not straightforward (and, as discussed below, of potential relevance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at all only if there is a realistic prospect of apprehension and conviction).</span>

<p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The importance of s55 to the data protection regime did not therefore lie in its centrality to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the operation of the regime, any functional dependence on it of other powers, the regularity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with which it was likely to be deployed or its operational visibility to the senior leadership of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the office. Nor, of course, is s55 a provision of inherent particular relevance to the press: it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a provision of complete generality, the offence able to be committed by &#8216;any person&#8217;, whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or not they are formally subject themselves to regulation by any of the other provisions of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">data protection regime.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his first witness statement, Mr Thomas suggested that s55 was likely to be the most relevant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provision of the Act to the Inquiry&#8217;s terms of reference.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref96" href="#footnote96">96</a></sup> Doubtless, he did so because of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prominence that he had given the issue in his strategic response to the Motorman evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the role of the press. It was on 15 April 2005, with the conviction and conditional discharge</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Mr Whittamore for s55 offences arising out of Motorman, that Mr Thomas records,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;When</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I heard this, I can recall personally and strongly sharing my team&#8217;s feelings of frustration.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref97" href="#footnote97">97</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He understood Counsel to have advised as a result that further prosecutions would not be in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public interest.<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;It</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> then</span><span style="font-style:italic"> my</span><span style="font-style:italic"> personal</span><span style="font-style:italic"> decision</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> commission</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> report</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> presented</span></span>

<p id="para-id-4-7"><a href="#para4-7" name="para4-7">4.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It will be necessary to consider the sentencing remarks of the judge and the reasons for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sentencing decision but they are, obviously, fact-specific, not least in relation to the personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstances of Mr Whittamore and his inability to meet the obligations of a financial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">penalty. The disappointment in the office at the Whittamore result is understandable, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consideration must also be given to the extent to which the disappointment was, in any</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">event, the direct result of the choices that had been made within the ICO about the extent of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its own engagement with the criminal process, and about pursuing alternative or additional</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operational options more generally.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-8"><a href="#para4-8" name="para4-8">4.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The outcome of the prosecution may have been a blow to the ICO principally because, in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">first place, it had represented the majority of its investment in an operational response to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Motorman material. It is beyond question, however, that there was an entirely justifiable and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">genuine sense that it would have been a travesty for matters to have been left there, given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the sheer extent of the evidence uncovered. It is not entirely clear why the approach adopted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was seen as the principal way forward.</span>

The unlawful trade in confidential information<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref98" href="#footnote98">98</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> report</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Parliament on the Motorman affair and its implications by the ICO issued pursuant to its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">powers under s52(2) of the Act.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref99" href="#footnote99">99</a></sup> The foreword provided by Mr Thomas introduced the report</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as being essentially about the evidence of a &#8220;pervasive and widespread &#8216;industry&#8217; devoted to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the illegal buying and selling&#8221; of information contrary to s55, and about the need for change</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the law. He put it this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref100" href="#footnote100">100</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The crime at present carries no custodial sentence. When cases involving the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">unlawful procurement or sale of confidential personal information come before the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">courts, convictions often bring no more than a derisory fine or a conditional discharge.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Low penalties devalue the data protection offence in the public mind and mask the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">true seriousness of the crime, even within the judicial system. They likewise do little</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to deter those who seek to buy or supply confidential information that should rightly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">remain private. The remedy I am proposing is to introduce a custodial sentence of up</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to two years for persons convicted on indictment, and up to six months for summary</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">convictions. The aim is not to send more people to prison but to discourage all who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">might be tempted to engage in this unlawful trade.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Motorman is cited as one of the major cases providing evidence for this trade, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a range of other cases are cited also.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-10"><a href="#para4-10" name="para4-10">4.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">What is striking about this analysis, and indeed about<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy?</span> more generally,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is the absence of any context within which s55 sits in the wider data protection regime.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Even ignoring the unexamined assumption that different sentence maxima would have a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">definitive impact on the problem, no attention is given to the obvious question of what other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operational means were available to the ICO to address the problem it had diagnosed. On the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contrary, the entire thrust of the report is directed to legislative change on criminal penalties.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As the foreword concludes:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref101" href="#footnote101">101</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;These concerns, and the need for increased penalties, have been raised with the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Department for Constitutional Affairs. The positive response that I have received so far</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is encouraging. These are early and welcome indications of progress on the possibility</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of Government action.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">What Price Privacy?<span style="font-style:normal"> set</span><span style="font-style:normal"> out</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> problem.</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Government</span><span style="font-style:normal"> action</span><span style="font-style:normal"> (and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> course</span><span style="font-style:normal"> action</span><span style="font-style:normal"> by</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC) was expressed to be the answer to the problem. To focus continued attention on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue, the ICO was to publish a follow up report after six months to monitor progress on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">answer.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-11"><a href="#para4-11" name="para4-11">4.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Putting to one side the important argument that breach of the criminal law should not simply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be seen as a cost of doing business, the most important deterrent the criminal justice system</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can provide is the likelihood of being caught. In the analysis of the perspective provided</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the criminal law,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref102" href="#footnote102">102</a></sup> the first problem in relation to data protection is that those whose</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal information is being illegally traded are unlikely to know about it with the result that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no complaint will ever be made. Thus, the critical aspect of Operation Motorman was the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">complications that will flow from the legal protection afforded to journalistic materials and to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sources. In truth, without victim complaints, the only systemic way of identifying criminality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of this sort is by the exercise of regulatory investigative powers. If there is a measure of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">confidence that crime will not be detected, the possibility of a custodial sentence may not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be sufficient to discourage the behaviour: it was not sufficient, for example, to prevent the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">phone hacking exposed by Operation Caryatid.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-12"><a href="#para4-12" name="para4-12">4.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas explained the objective behind his focus on increasing the maximum available</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sentence for s55 in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref104" href="#footnote104">104</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think I had quite a long list of objectives by the end of the day, by the time we got to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">publishing this report. The first objective was to tell the world what was going on. The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">primary stated objective was to get the recommendations taken seriously, particularly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to get the government to increase the penalty, because we felt the penalty was the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">main problem. But I also felt &#8211; and I&#8217;m not sure this was articulated, but in my own</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mind &#8211; the more noise we could make about this, even if not successful in getting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the law changed, the more that was likely to have a beneficial result. I wanted to get</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people on the back foot.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although the significance of a maximum which was financial (so that any penalty would have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be linked to means to pay) is important, it is difficult to see it as the &#8216;main problem&#8217; facing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a regulator armed with other means of enforcing the law and driving up standards. It had,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">however, attained a more symbolic quality.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-13"><a href="#para4-13" name="para4-13">4.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is possible to sympathise with the description of the problem in the introduction to<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">which the sentence maxima stood proxy for the regime as a whole. In the perennial struggle</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to get data protection (and, thus, the ICO) taken seriously, whether by regulated business, by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public, by the courts, by politicians, or by the press, the ICO quite understandably needed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to make a public example of the Motorman find. The outcome of the Whittamore prosecution</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could be thought to reveal that the wider objective had been set back and that failure was in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">turn symptomatic of the lack of seriousness with which the courts seemed to consider data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protection. The sentence maxima contributed to that lack of seriousness, and were in turn a</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">sign of a lack of legislative seriousness: a failure at the political level to take data protection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seriously. The s55 campaign was to that extent a test of political commitment, and as such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">existential for the ICO. The Motorman evidence, and the other evidence referred to in<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The ICO put heavy effort into promoting the two reports. The main aim was to secure</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">announcing the intention to produce a second (progress) report was deliberately part</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of this strategy.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I was personally involved in this promotional activity to a very considerable extent. The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Commissioner - as the personification and leader of the ICO - is obviously expected to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be a visible part of all major activity. In this case, I attached particular priority to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">issue and also viewed promoting the reports as a tangible way of fulfilling a wider</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ambition to get data protection taken more seriously.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-15"><a href="#para4-15" name="para4-15">4.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Motorman triggered the political campaign on s55 although that campaign was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">neither a specific response to the evidence uncovered by Motorman, nor was it addressed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specifically to the culture, practices and ethics of the press. At its heart, although it was much</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more general and, in the mind of Mr Thomas, symbolic of the struggle to get data protection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken seriously by a wider political audience, it very quickly acquired totemic resonances of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very different kind in the political arena into which<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy?</span> had ventured.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-16"><a href="#para4-16" name="para4-16">4.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is important to appreciate that the ICO campaign on s55 was not targeted specifically at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists although the campaign against it was championed by the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref106" href="#footnote106">106</a></sup> The publication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy?</span> marked the emergence into the public arena of what had until then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been low-key policy discussions with the Department for Constitutional Affairs about law</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reform. It also coincided with a point in the protracted and frustrating dialogue between Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thomas and the PCC at which the latter had formed a view that there was little it was able or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">willing to contribute to the nominally jointly-espoused aim of effecting culture change in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press, without direct regulatory engagement by the ICO with the industry.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-17"><a href="#para4-17" name="para4-17">4.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The arrival of<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy?</span> proclaimed the introduction of custodial penalties as &#8216;the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">solution&#8217; to the problem the ICO had been describing to the PCC. This could reasonably have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been expected to have been interpreted by the industry as &#8216;the solution&#8217; directed to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">culture, practices and ethics of the press in relation to the acquisition and use of personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information. It was a solution the press entirely rejected for itself. Two results predictably</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">followed. The first was the mobilisation of a political lobbying effort by the press against the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">campaign, directed to the heart of government. The second was a hardening of the attitude</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press (now unmistakably represented by the PCC) towards the ICO.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-18"><a href="#para4-18" name="para4-18">4.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">AsMrThomas described,hispoliticalcampaignwasbothelaborateandextensive;onanybasis,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was a major undertaking and a substantial investment of his personal time and attention.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The follow-up report expressed disappointment with the opposition from within the press</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">underestimating the existing protections in the law and the commitment of the ICO itself to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">freedom of expression. Its conclusion was that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref110" href="#footnote110">110</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There is still further work to be done to reduce the demand for illegally obtained</span>

<h2>5.<em>What Price Privacy?</em> The reaction of the PCC and the editors</h2>

<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At this point it is appropriate to return to the dialogue between Mr Thomas and the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whose &#8216;formal response&#8217; had been to direct the ICO to the Editors&#8217; Code Committee while</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">noting that the issue had become &#8216;complicated&#8217; by the publication of the DCA consultation</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">on s55.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 21 September 2006, Mr Thomas met Ian Beales, Secretary of the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Committee. Mr Thomas described the meeting in his internal note as &#8216;interesting and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intelligent&#8217;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref111" href="#footnote111">111</a></sup> In addition to the established themes of louder condemnation of unacceptable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and suitable amendments to the Code, Mr Thomas was explicitly now also looking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for &#8216;better awareness of s55&#8217; from the industry. S55 was evidently the dominant theme in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">event, Mr Thomas with a degree of understatement indicating that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;support</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> prison</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">paper and stressing the &#8216;chilling effect&#8217; of the proposal. Mr Thomas had proffered some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposed Code changes of his own but came away from the meeting largely empty handed.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-3"><a href="#para5-3" name="para5-3">5.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On Mr Thomas&#8217;s account, Mr Beales&#8217;s position was simple:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;his</span><span style="font-style:italic"> main</span><span style="font-style:italic"> difficulty</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> there</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not much incentive to improve the Code unless the threat of increased penalties disappears at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the same time&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><span style="font-style:normal"> If</span><span style="font-style:normal"> accurately</span><span style="font-style:normal"> represented,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> this</span><span style="font-style:normal"> is</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span><span style="font-style:normal"> somewhat</span><span style="font-style:normal"> remarkable</span><span style="font-style:normal"> position</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> adopt:</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the offence contained within s55 was the law and contained within it a defence for journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acting in the public interest. A Code of Conduct should surely provide the very best guidance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it can and it is difficult to see why there needs to be an incentive to improve it.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-4"><a href="#para5-4" name="para5-4">5.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In any event, the press had fully subsumed the dialogue between the ICO and the PCC into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its own political campaign in opposition to reform of s55 and it may be legitimate to infer the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extent to which Mr Thomas had accepted that reconstitution of the agenda: his note suggests</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the talk of producing joint guidance was now explicitly in terms of &#8216;better section 55</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">guidance&#8217; rather than anything more generally addressed to the culture, practices and ethics</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the press in the handling of personal information.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 27 October 2006, there was a follow-up meeting (at NI&#8217;s Wapping premises): the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Committee Chairman Les Hinton, and Stephen Abell from the PCC also attended. The note of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that meeting suggests that Mr Hinton made plain from the outset that the Code Committee</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had no mandate to take a position at that point but was considering its response to<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">familiar course but with Mr Thomas now leading on s55. Dealing with the &#8216;illegal trade&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">needed tougher sentences, but these were not targeted at journalists (who in any event had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the protection of special exemptions), he was seeking co-operation with guidance and code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">revisions as a means of addressing journalism&#8217;s contribution to the demand side of that illegal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">trade. Mr Thomas had evidently responded to the industry&#8217;s elision of the PCC dialogue and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the s55 campaign, not by attempting to return the dialogue to its original broader purpose</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but by accepting the redrawn terms of reference and trying to argue his side of that debate.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-6"><a href="#para5-6" name="para5-6">5.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Hinton&#8217;s response, however, is illuminative of the distance this dialogue had shifted from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the original sceptical but pragmatic tone of the PCC in the opening stages of the encounter.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Not only did he deploy the familiar challenge back to the ICO on the question of regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inaction, and the clear statement of objection to the s55 campaign, cast in the language</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the chilling effect on journalism, but he moved the counter-attack on to the territory of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the principles of press self-regulation. Mr Thomas records the Committee representatives as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">having:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref113" href="#footnote113">113</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;expressed the view that a prison sentence would undermine the effective operation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the PCC as legal advice is likely to result in journalists not cooperating with PCC</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigations in case they incriminate themselves. In addition explicit inclusion of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">offences in the code would need to be investigated by the prosecuting authority not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the PCC effectively taking that provision outside of and therefore undermining the self</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regulatory model.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This ignores the fact that the criminal offence existed and was hardly the constructive dialogue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of fellow regulators; this was taking the political battle on to definitive territory with an open</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">challenge to the ICO to retreat from PCC (that is to say industry) territory.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-7"><a href="#para5-7" name="para5-7">5.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In a contemporaneous handwritten note by Mr Thomas,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref114" href="#footnote114">114</a></sup> the words &#8216;last chance saloon&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appear. At one stage earlier in the dialogue, Mr Thomas appears to have deployed an</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">intimation that the credibility of the PCC as a &#8216;self-regulator&#8217; was at stake in response to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the action he sought from them in the aftermath of Motorman. If he was seeking to deploy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it again in the highly-charged context of the s55 debate that was undoubtedly a high-risk</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political strategy, and Mr Hinton&#8217;s response would be to a degree less startling. Needless</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to say, Mr Thomas emerged from that meeting empty handed again. Mr Hinton&#8217;s follow-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">up letter of 17 November was more positive in tone, but non-committal as regards further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry action.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref115" href="#footnote115">115</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-8"><a href="#para5-8" name="para5-8">5.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It was now fully three years since Mr Thomas had moved to open a dialogue with the PCC,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">during which period he had identified himself very personally with the conduct of that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship. The return on that significant personal investment was not evident. But even</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">now, at a point which might be described as open antagonism, there was no evidence that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sought to reappraise his approach. It is possible that one effect of the elision of the PCC and</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 4 January 2007, there was a further meeting with Murdoch MacLennan (then Chief</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Executive Officer of Telegraph Media Group) and Guy Black, both by this stage leading actors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the s55 counter-campaign. On Mr Thomas&#8217; account,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref117" href="#footnote117">117</a></sup> the agreed action points were that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ICO should prepare guidance on s55 and the public interest defence with a view to helping</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists to navigate it. It is notable, first, that the focus appears to have swung fully around</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the industry representatives being asked to take action to change the culture, practices</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and ethics of the press, to the regulator being asked to clarify the law and his approach to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation. Secondly, this appears, in itself, to have become part of what was, by now, a three-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way negotiation on s55 between the press, the government and Mr Thomas.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-11"><a href="#para5-11" name="para5-11">5.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The course of that negotiation is set out more fully in that part of the Report that deals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the relationship between the press and politicians.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref118" href="#footnote118">118</a></sup> It culminated in a compromise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arrangement whereby a custodial penalty for s55 was finally introduced by the Criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Justice and Immigration Act 2008,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref119" href="#footnote119">119</a></sup> together with an enhanced, more subjective defence for</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists, but neither provision was commenced as operative law; commencement relies</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the exercise of an Order-making power which has not to date been exercised. At the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">same time, further desultory exchanges were continuing between Mr Thomas and the PCC.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By letter of 27 March 2007, the Code Committee eventually rejected the amendments to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Code that he had proposed, but suggested some alternatives.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref120" href="#footnote120">120</a></sup> The ICO responded on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">16 April, accepting the changes on the basis of a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;hope that they will be introduced with maximum publicity and advice to the media.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Otherwise, the &#8216;burial&#8217; of the changes within the existing Code, and the absence of a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">section explicitly prohibiting the obtaining of any private information without consent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or a public interest justification, may present the risk that unacceptable activity will</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 25 April 2007, there was a further meeting with Guy Black and colleagues from press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">representative bodies to discuss &#8216;stakeholder engagement&#8217; and the preparation of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">guidance. It seems to have been inconclusive. The press representatives saw their role in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to the guidance as &#8216;supporting and commenting and they do not envisage a jointly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">badged product&#8217;; the ICO undertook to shorten and simplify the latest draft of the s.55</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">guidance.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref122" href="#footnote122">122</a></sup> A new version was worked on over the late spring and summer of 2007. Work</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also began within the ICO on a draft statement of prosecution policy on s55, designed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provide a measure of reassurance to the press as the ICO continued its campaign for custodial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">penalties over the first half of 2008.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-13"><a href="#para5-13" name="para5-13">5.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An insight into the extent to which Mr Thomas had become very personally engaged in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politics of the passage of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Justice and Immigration</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Bill can be gained from some of the contemporary documentation which he provided to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry. In February 2008, the ICO prepared a draft report to Parliament in response</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to its apprehension that the amendment would be withdrawn by the Government in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">face of press-sponsored opposition<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref123" href="#footnote123">123</a></sup> as well as briefing for Ministers and recommendations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for Parliamentary handling.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref124" href="#footnote124">124</a></sup> It also shows Mr Thomas directly lobbying the Government</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">against withdrawal of the amendment in terms which included:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) urging that &#8216;withdrawal would damage the reinvigorated credibility and authority of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">data protection law and the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office&#8217;;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) an intimation that withdrawal would &#8216;sit strangely&#8217; with the Government&#8217;s legislation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on identity cards;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) the anticipation of support in a number of outstanding Select Committee Reports;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) ripostes to the press campaigning;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) averring a determination on his own part to stop the pernicious, largely hidden and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">illegal market in personal data; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(f) a conclusion, &#8216;with considerable reluctance&#8217; that he would respond to withdrawal by</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">laying a further specific report before Parliament.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref125" href="#footnote125">125</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In due course, Mr Thomas met the Prime Minister, preparing for an agreed role in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">continuing political negotiations between the Government and the press. He said that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;the</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">PM started by saying that I had the most difficult job in the country<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8217;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref126" href="#footnote126">126</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-14"><a href="#para5-14" name="para5-14">5.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is noteworthy that Mr Thomas was placing no (other) operational action by the ICO into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this political arena. There was no proffered action plan for the means by which the ICO would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">structure its priorities and operations so as to ensure that the legislative change would,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indeed, stop the trafficking of confidential personal information. The assumption appeared</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to remain that the change in its own right, and the accompanying publicity for the role of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ICO in promoting that change, would be effective in themselves. An internal note of a</span>

<a name="page1028"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">meeting that Mr Thomas had with senior officials from the Ministry of Justice (the successor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">department to the DCA) is illustrative of the way he was thinking.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref127" href="#footnote127">127</a></sup> As well as offering an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assessment of the party politics of the Bill&#8217;s provisions, he described his likely public reaction</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to a then-current possibility to change its provisions significantly in favour of the press. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would, he said, be<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;nuclear&#8221;</span> :</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I said it would be very noisy and very messy. We will publicly denounce any such</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">attempt. If we lost, we would publish a third report to Parliament, documenting how</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this state of affairs had come about.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-15"><a href="#para5-15" name="para5-15">5.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Suggestions that the press might finally take steps of their own (such as amendment to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Code, training and guidance) to address the extent to which their own culture, practices and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethics were in issue were now dismissed as &#8216;too little, too late&#8217;. Only a change in the law would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">do. To that end, Mr Thomas wrote to selected high profile opposition politicians (including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Conservative and Liberal Democrat leaders) as &#8216;a warning shot across the bows of those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who might be wavering and as an encouragement to potential supporters&#8217; and planned press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">releases and a public media initiative.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-16"><a href="#para5-16" name="para5-16">5.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This was not a regulator simply enhancing public debate from an expert point of view. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thomas himself described it as &#8216;playing hard ball&#8217;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref128" href="#footnote128">128</a></sup> or, in other words, full-blooded political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">campaigning. As noted above, the issue was settled for the time being by the compromise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">solution of legislation for custodial penalties (along with an improved defence) which was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then and has not since been commenced. At the same time, correspondence continued with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry representatives over the summer of 2008 about the publication of guidance and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">promotion of awareness.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-17"><a href="#para5-17" name="para5-17">5.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">About the compromise solution on s55, Mr Thomas himself said this:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref129" href="#footnote129">129</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;This was clearly the end of this particular road. I saw the compromise in &#8220;half a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">loaf&#8221; terms and &#8211; although very disappointed &#8211; recognised that it would still serve</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">some deterrent and awareness-raising purpose, though less direct or powerful than</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">originally envisaged.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-18"><a href="#para5-18" name="para5-18">5.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Reflecting more generally on his interaction with the PCC, Mr Thomas referred many times</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to an overall sense of disappointment. This is important commentary and it is worth setting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some of them out in full.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) &#8220;I think over time I was somewhat disappointed. Although I don&#8217;t decry</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">everything they did, it fell short of what I&#8217;d hoped they might be doing.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref130" href="#footnote130">130</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) &#8220;The evidence shows that I went back a number of times to the PCC throughout</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2005, 2006 and 2007, and tried to keep &#8211; engage their interest with it. But it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is true to say that I thought their response was less strident and I think I used</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the word &#8220;disappointing&#8221; more than once in this context. I thought they could</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">much stronger and louder condemnation of wholly unacceptable misconduct,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an explicit change to the Code, and more focussed guidance. Instead, there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">seemed to be a &#8220;Catch-22&#8221; view that the conduct was already illegal and that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">therefore not much &#8211; if anything &#8211; could be done by way of self-regulation.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The exchanges did lead to guidance (with which the ICO assisted) on data</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">protection law at large and some discussion about possible changes to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Code, but this increasingly seemed directed as much as heading off tougher</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">sentences.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref133" href="#footnote133">133</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-19"><a href="#para5-19" name="para5-19">5.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Notwithstanding all of this, Mr Thomas made clear his view that his strategy (that is to say, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">continuing dialogue with the PCC, publication of his two reports to Parliament, and getting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the law changed, despite the non-commencement of the changes) had proved to be very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effective, at any rate in relation to the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref134" href="#footnote134">134</a></sup> His grounds for saying so come down to what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he claimed was the lack of evidence of criminal conduct within the press postdating 2006:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref135" href="#footnote135">135</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I am not saying it&#8217;s been eliminated altogether &#8211; this is under the surface, clearly &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but I am saying &#8211; and my successor has said this to Parliament very recently, in October</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of this year [2011] &#8211; that it appears that the press are now behaving themselves in this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">particular area.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-20"><a href="#para5-20" name="para5-20">5.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Such empirical evidence as Mr Thomas offers for this conclusion appears to amount to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accepting the word of the industry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref136" href="#footnote136">136</a></sup> Without asserting the contrary, absence of evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that undermines that assertion is not the same as saying that there is evidence that it is so. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the circumstances, it is necessary to consider the claims made by Mr Thomas for his strategy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in general and to examine the paths that the ICO chose not to follow in parallel and, from</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">there, to review whether, in more recent times, the press has, in fact, ceased to be any real</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">source of interest to the ICO.</span>
