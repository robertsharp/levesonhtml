<h1>CHAPTER 4<br/>THE ICO AND THE PRESS TODAY</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The current Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham, took over from Mr Thomas in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the summer of 2009. In the context of this Inquiry, it is of interest that his previous career</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was in journalism, broadcasting and regulation (he was a former Director General of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Advertising Standards Authority), rather than in law.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He told the Inquiry that the culture, practices and ethics of the press were not drawn to his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attentiononhandoverasanissueoftoppriority.Hewas,however,awarethatcommencement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the legislative changes to s55 was outstanding and he made a connection between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legislative change and press conduct saying that there was:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;a sword of Damocles hanging over the press. If there was any repetition of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">behaviour that Operation Motorman had uncovered that would be accessed pretty</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">quickly.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the event, he had what he described as a &#8216;wake up call&#8217; a few weeks after taking up his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appointment when the story by Nick Davies about phone hacking was published in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Guardian<span style="font-style:italic"> .</span> His principal focus thereafter was not, however, operational but political: he had to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prepare for his appearance on 2 September 2009 before the Culture Media and Sport Select</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Committee<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> which was then taking evidence specifically as a result of the emergence of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Goodman/Mulcaire case and the coverage in the Guardian, but linking it also with the history</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Operation Motorman. This was therefore an opportunity for Mr Graham to take stock</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the history of Motorman, the role of the ICO, and the signs from the emerging hacking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scandal that the story of press abuse of personal information was taking a new direction.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">His evidence to the Select Committee was that:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) phonehackingwasamatterforthepoliceandtheICOhad&#8216;noinvolvementwhatsoever&#8217;;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) any operational steps the ICO could have taken in relation to Motorman (including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal investigations into journalists) would have been too difficult practically and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legally and were not a priority call on resources at the time;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) the priority of the ICO in relation to Motorman was to &#8216;sound the alarm, to warn the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry, to talk to the PCC, to urge the provision of a custodial penalty&#8217; and the latter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remained the priority;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) there was little more that could now be done in relation to the Motorman material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">without more, not least because it was old and not straightforward to interpret; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) he had no intention at this point of proactively reviewing the Motorman evidence,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because it would serve little purpose and the ICO had many other priorities.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The question of priorities was a matter of some concern to the Committee at the time. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Graham was pressed particularly hard on the position of the victims, some of whom were</span>

<a name="page1054"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">expressing anger at not having been notified by the ICO of their appearance in the Motorman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material. Mr Graham indicated that he would treat approaches from individuals inquiring</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about their possible appearance in the Motorman material on a case by case basis. He was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also pressed on whether the ICO had worked with the organisations, both public and private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sector, whose information had been wrongly disclosed in the Motorman case; a certain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">amount of work had been done but various factors had limited the extent of the engagement.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These included the increasing general insecurity of information of all sorts, the flourishing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">illegal trade in information procurement, and the risk that any investigation would itself</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">present a risk of the further dissemination of the personal information in question</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not necessary to consider Mr Graham&#8217;s evidence to the Select Committee in detail,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because the same ground was explored in the course of his evidence to the Inquiry. His</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">general update to the Committee on the work of the ICO work with the press at that time is,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">however, interesting. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We started off by a general call to the industry which, indeed, was heeded to some</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">extent in that the Editors&#8217; Code Committee eventually amended clause 10 of the Code,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">made it much tougher, and we have done a lot of work with the PCC in training editors.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We have done a couple of seminars, one in London and one in Scotland, to make</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sure that journalists understand that this is serious. I saw a copy of the Editors&#8217; Code</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Handbook the other day and it makes it very clear that you mix with the Data Protection</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Act at your peril and you had better have a very solid public interest story very well</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">documented, in order to do that. Chairman, the interesting question is why did not any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of those titles that were listed in What Price Privacy Now? contact the Information</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Commissioner&#8217;s Office and say, &#8220;This is terrible, 45 of our journalists apparently have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been doing this thing which we utterly condemn, tell us who they are&#8221;, and we then</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">might have been able to talk turkey. Interestingly, of 305 journalists, and we listed the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">total in the document, we have not had a single inquiry from a journalist saying, &#8220;Am I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on that list? Was I doing something wrong?&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has also had to consider the question of the lack of press interest in pursuing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Motorman evidence but it is also important to look at the position from the perspective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the ICO. Its own stocktake, at the end of 2009, was that it was aware that Mr Thomas&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political campaign had at best been only partially successful, and had also established a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hostile response from the press. It knew that neither the ICO itself, nor evidently the press,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">had followed up the Motorman evidence operationally, either in relation to the particulars</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the state and use of the information itself, the conduct of individual journalists, or its own</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices. Finally, it was on notice of the emergence of the phone hacking scandal.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Notwithstanding this assessment, the ICO had concluded that there was no imperative for it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to engage further with the culture, practices and ethics of the press. In particular, Mr Graham</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expressed the view to the Select Committee in relation to the PCC that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;We</span><span style="font-style:italic"> do</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> any</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">formal relationship with them, but I just accept that they do press standards and we do data</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">protection and, where those two things cross over, then we probably need to talk.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The two things clearly do cross over. In concluding this Part of the Report, assessing the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">current state of the role and functions of the ICO, and making recommendations for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">future, the focus returns to the key themes of the Motorman case, but viewed now from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contemporary perspective. Those themes are:</span>

<h2>2. Personal information privacy and press practices</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Graham&#8217;s evidence to the Inquiry was that he did not believe that the press was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significantly involved in breaches of the Data Protection Act since the publication of the<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Price Privacy?<span style="font-style:normal"> reports,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> therefore,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> by</span><span style="font-style:normal"> implication,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> they</span><span style="font-style:normal"> had</span><span style="font-style:normal"> learned</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> lessons</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those reports. This evidence is at the heart of the Inquiry&#8217;s terms of reference, and, given the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way in which the phone hacking scandal developed, is not entirely obvious. It thus requires</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">close analysis.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Graham put the matter in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I can only speak of what&#8217;s in my own knowledge, and I can only speak of those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">aspects of press conduct that fall within the responsibilities of my office, and that&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">primarily Section 55. I know that the Inquiry was triggered by concerns about hacking</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of phones and hacking of emails, these are criminal offences that don&#8217;t come under</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Information Commissioner&#8217;s office, but Section 55 certainly does. I can&#8217;t prove a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">negative. All I can say is I&#8217;ve seen no further evidence beyond what we published in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2006, and that of course was about behaviour before when Mr Whittamore&#8217;s office</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was raided, and much of it related to activity between 1999 and 2003. I simply offer a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">view that this is an issue of such high salience, many investigative journalists working</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the area, great rivalry between newspaper groups, lots of campaigners, that if there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was evidence of further breaches of Section 55 by the press, it would have been drawn</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to my attention, and it hasn&#8217;t been.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The latter point was one on which he expanded:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;there&#8217;s been so much feverish activity over the past two years in relation to this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with the various newspaper groups, with the journalists, with the books written on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the subject, with the campaigning groups. If the best that critics can do is to turn up</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">further evidence of what was going on between 1999 and 2003, it doesn&#8217;t amount to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">much.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The questions raised by this evidence were many, and included:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) why s55 (the criminal offence of unlawfully obtaining information) was being used</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as the benchmark for contravention of the regime rather than the wider scheme of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principles and rights created by the regime;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) why Mr Graham would have expected investigative journalists or other campaigners to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been likely to excavate issues about the press and personal information which the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO, charged with legal responsibilities in that respect, was not itself minded to pursue;</span>

<a name="page1056"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) why the ICO did not appear to consider that the phone hacking scandal itself and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wider issues of the culture, practices and ethics of the press before the Inquiry were a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cause of acute concern within its own sphere;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) why the ICO was able to conclude that the Motorman evidence was of no continuing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest or relevance in relation to the data protection regime; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) if the ICO was unaware of any problems in relation to the press, to what extent that was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a reasonable conclusion based on due diligence.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The due diligence point had particularly exercised Tom Watson MP in putting the following</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">questions to Mr Graham (and his ICO colleague Mr Clancy) on behalf of the Select Committee:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. What I am trying to do is ascertain responsibility in the system for getting this right.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8230; Are you convinced that these practices have now ended in newsrooms up and down</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the country?&#8221; A: &#8220;I am not in a position to know.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. &#8220;What I am trying to understand is that the decision you took, which, by the way, I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think was the right decision, to blow this open, bring it into the public domain and try</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and effect massive change in the way journalists run about their work, I can understand</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">why in a resource-sensitive area that is what you did, but what I cannot understand is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">why you have not gone back to see whether that has been successful or not or what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">gauge of success there is.&#8221; A: &#8220;How can we measure it? Do we go to editors and say,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;Have you come across any examples of journalists that have stepped over the line?&#8217;&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. &#8220;Is there anyone in this country who would know whether these practices are still</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">going on other than editors and journalists in the newsrooms?&#8221; A: &#8220;Well, editors and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalists must know; it is a self-regulatory system.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. &#8220;So, when they tell us that they think that they have thoroughly investigated the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">matter and they have put it right, do you think they could possibly have done that if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they do not know the list of journalists that you have got on your files?&#8221; A: &#8220;I think there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">might be information which would identify some of those journalists because some of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the invoices quite clearly indicate that there have been blags in relation to particular</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">stories and invoice numbers. Surely, their records should be able to cross-reference that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to a particular journalist, and sometimes the invoices cross-reference the stories, so</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">editors could examine their business and perhaps identify which journalists were or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were not.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220; Q: &#8220; I think you could perhaps be a little proactive just to ensure that they have certainly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">done that or that they certainly have the information about the people who were at it?&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A: &#8220;I understand what the Committee is saying, but you are not dealing with a regulator</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who is not proactive; we are proactive on a very wide front. &#8230; There are lots of ways we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could spend our time.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The due diligence point itself resolved itself into a number of sub-issues relating to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question of specific follow-up to Motorman; the strategic follow-up to Mr Thomas&#8217;s political</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">campaign, the response to the phone hacking scandal, and the position of the ICO in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the press today. These will be discussed in turn.</span>

<h2>3. Following up Operation Motorman</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As is frequently repeated, Operation Motorman was the single biggest case of deliberate and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">systemic interference with personal information with which the ICO had had to deal since its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inception. The ICO had taken no operational measures in respect of the case since handing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">over the Whittamore prosecution to the CPS. There had been modest progress in issuing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">general guidance to the industry after years of discussion with the PCC. A custodial penalty</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for s55 offences had been provisionally introduced but not activated. This fell short of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">steps Mr Thomas had wanted to see in order to put a stop to Motorman-type practices in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press for the future. The ICO remained very concerned about the evidence it continued</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to encounter of an extensive illegal market in personal information beyond the activities of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press. It had no reason to believe that private investigators similar to Mr Whittamore</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were not operating in the market. It is therefore necessary to consider whether there was (or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should have been) a question mark in the mind of the ICO as to whether or not the objective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of putting a stop to the engagement by the press in the illegal market in personal information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had in fact been achieved.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That general question might resolve itself into a number of specific questions. Firstly, what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had happened to the information which the press had acquired<span style="font-style:italic"> prima</span><span style="font-style:italic"> facie</span> in breach of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the data protection regime from Mr Whittamore? Secondly, what effect had the<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">customers of Mr Whittamore) to eliminate this sort of conduct from their culture, practices</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and ethics?</span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the follow-up to the question of press conduct in relation to blagging and related</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">activities, Mr Graham confirmed to the Inquiry the position he had taken in front of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Select Committee. The ICO had made no active investigations of any nature in relation to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Motorman material itself. No material had been brought to its attention suggesting that there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was any problem. In the absence of that, it was not its role to pursue enquiries. It had other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">current priorities.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was also, in his view, no case for a proactive approach to the victims. But he did say</span>

<h2>4. Following up the political campaign</h2>

<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Before the Select Committee, Mr Graham appeared to be continuing to connect the s55</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">campaign with the issue of press misconduct. This exchange with Mr Watson was interesting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in that context:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. &#8220;But the evidence you have in front of you shows that there was law-breaking on an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">industrial scale from the newsrooms of some of the major newspapers in the United</span>

<a name="page1058"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. &#8220;I am afraid I am going to become repetitive. You simply cannot run regulatory</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bodies on the basis that you go chasing after every detail that a particular investigative</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalist decides should be the agenda for the day when you have got other very big</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and important questions. I am not pleading poverty here, I am just saying that you can</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">only do what you can do. We thought, possibly naively, that, by telling Parliament about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this back in 2006 and calling for the custodial sentence, we could close the thing down.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think they still can, but it is taking too long.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As noted above, the ICO has continued to press for the activation of the custodial penalties</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for s55 offences, but no longer apparently with any direct focus on making an impact on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press. Although not directly a matter for the Inquiry, no account has been offered of how the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case for the activation of those penalties has been affected by the more recent availability of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">civil penalties. In any event, however, the case for the activation of the s55 penalties in so far</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as it has a bearing on the matters before the Inquiry is considered on its own merits below.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If the ICO has yet to realise the benefits of the s55 campaign (and there remains no evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of any active planning within the office for doing so &#8211; the effect still appears to be considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be self-activating), it seems to be continuing to reap the dividend of general press hostility.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That too requires consideration.</span>

<h2>5. Phone hacking and the ICO</h2>

<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the evidence gathered during Operation Motorman&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In terms of pure personal information, the parallels between phone hacking and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Motorman activities are very clear. Shorn of the labels provided by the criminal law, both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">come down to the press employing unscrupulous external agents to obtain confidential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal information about other people. Further, that information is provided without their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">knowledge or consent and obtained by unlawful means whether by deceit, corruption, or the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exploitation of technology. In respect of any individual piece of information, the journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may or may not have had good reasons or formal defences for doing so. But<span style="font-style:italic"> prima</span><span style="font-style:italic"> facie</span> these</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">were the sort of invasive practices from which the data protection regime (along with its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principles and rights) was designed to protect people.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There were on the face of it two reasons why the ICO might have taken a keen interest in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Goodman/Mulcaire developments In the first place, there was the indication that even in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">post-Motorman environment, sections of the press were still involved in the unlawful trade</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in personal information. This was a clear warning signal in its own right that all might not be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">well in the approach and practice of the press regarding personal information, and raised a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question mark against the efficacy of the strategy of the ICO for responding to Motorman.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-3"><a href="#para5-3" name="para5-3">5.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the second place, there was the concern whether there could be any direct relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between Motorman and Goodman/Mulcaire. This was the question which had occurred</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Mr Owens:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup> was it possible that the private phone numbers obtained by the press via</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;friends and family&#8217; numbers), had been used to hack their phones? Were these precisely the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private lines most likely to have been used by the &#8216;targets&#8217; for the purposes of confidential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conversations, texts or voicemails? Mr Owens told the Inquiry that he took these questions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and thoughts to Nick Davies of the Guardian. He also told the Inquiry that there seemed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be considerable overlap between the target names in the Motorman material and in the</span>

<p id="para-id-5-4"><a href="#para5-4" name="para5-4">5.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If the connection was made in the mind of the ICO, whether at either the general or the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking and blagging were separate activities and that the ICO had no formal role in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the former because it had no prosecution or criminal investigation powers in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking, which was a police matter.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup> He had put it bluntly to the Select Committee:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We were not involved, so far as I know and I cannot think of any reason why we would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be, in the most recent PCC investigation which was into the Goodman case which, I will</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">repeat, was about hacking and not about blagging, so I would have been surprised if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they had come to us and, if they had, I would have had to say, &#8216;Can&#8217;t help you, chum&#8217;.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-5"><a href="#para5-5" name="para5-5">5.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Counsel to the Inquiry pressed Mr Graham on the broader question; the newspaper industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had claimed, and the ICO appear to have accepted that claim, that after the ICO&#8217;s 2006</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reports, it had cleaned up its act. How could we know that was true, given that we did know</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it hadn&#8217;t cleaned up its act in relation to phone hacking? Mr Graham&#8217;s answer was that they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were different things.</span>

<h3>The ICO&#8217;s current stance</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-6"><a href="#para5-6" name="para5-6">5.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Graham&#8217;s position that the ICO had no particular reason to take an interest in the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was challenged in the course of his oral evidence to the Inquiry. His response was that it was</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">a matter for the politicians, the PCC or indeed for the Inquiry itself to find out whether there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was a problem with the press&#8217; approach to personal information.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup> Furthermore, the ICO had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">many other current priorities.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-7"><a href="#para5-7" name="para5-7">5.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Graham explained that he had no present intention of using his powers, or taking any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other step formally or informally, to consider the culture, practices and ethics of the press in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to personal information. Put to him that he had positive responsibilities to promote</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compliance and good practice, that he had appropriate investigatory powers to take proactive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">steps to consider the position of the press in this regard, and that it would not on the face of it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involve any great exercise to do so, he remained clear that he had other competing demands</span>

<a name="page1060"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">on his time. He did conclude, however, that should the Inquiry recommend that he consider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deploying his resources in this way, that view would be something the ICO would have to take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very seriously.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup> I return to this.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-8"><a href="#para5-8" name="para5-8">5.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As an independent statutory regulator, the ICO has a prerogative to set its own priorities</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within the overall scheme of the powers and duties entrusted to it by Parliament. For the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behaviour of the press to have no part in those priorities is not, on the face of it however, easy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to understand. The ICO was created to have custody of the issue of the law and practice of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information privacy as articulated in the data protection regime. This Inquiry was established</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to address arguably the greatest crisis in public confidence in information privacy since the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">creation of the data protection regime. A great deal of the evidence received by the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about press misconduct related to personal information privacy (including inaccuracy). The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">persistence of the ICO, even in the face of the commissioning of the Inquiry and the evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">received by it, in seeking to recuse itself from any proactive engagement in addressing the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">crisisinpublicconfidencewastroubling.Evenallowingfortheinevitablyparticularperspective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the Inquiry has, I do not find it easy to accept the proposition that the lack of priority</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which the ICO accorded to the press issue is obviously reconcilable with its overall public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibilities.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-9"><a href="#para5-9" name="para5-9">5.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Before reaching a final conclusion on that point, however, it is necessary to reflect on whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there were in fact other, possibly structural, explanations for its unwillingness to put itself</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">forward as a significant part of the answer to the concerns before the Inquiry.</span>
