<h1>CHAPTER 2<br/>THE APPROACH</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Setting up and preliminaries</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This Inquiry is unlike any other for a number of reasons. The principal reason concerns the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way in which Inquiries are generally conducted. Usually, an event such as a disaster or other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">type of incident giving rise to public concern occurs. The natural anxiety is to learn, first of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all, what precisely has caused the event to happen and, thereafter, what should be done</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to prevent repetition. Albeit based on an inquisitorial model (with Counsel to the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conducting the forensic investigation), a judicial inquiry will thereafter proceed rather as any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">judicial investigation or trial might. Witnesses to the incident will be called and the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">panel will then exercise the usual functions of a judge sitting alone and &#8216;find&#8217; the facts, that is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to say, on the balance of probabilities, reach conclusions as to what actually happened. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exercise will usually involve deciding precisely what, as a matter of fact, caused or led to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">event, who was responsible for making what decisions and what impact those decisions have</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">had.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A civil (or criminal) trial would then go further and determine the standard required by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">civil (or criminal) law and decide whether that standard has been met. If it has not, civil (or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal) liability will result. In the former case, damages or some other remedy will follow to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">benefit those who have suffered injury or financial loss as a consequence. A conviction in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal trial will lead to the imposition of a sanction or sentence. An Inquiry, however, does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not lead to these consequences. Although the facts will be found as to what has happened</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and why, an Inquiry will go on to recommend steps that might be taken in the future to avoid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">similar problems. There is and will be no determination of civil or criminal liability.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The difference in the case of this Inquiry is the fact of the criminal investigations being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undertaken by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS). The most important are Operation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Weeting (into the interception of mobile telephone messages), Operation Elveden (into the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">payment of police officers, and, indeed, others holding public office or position, by the press)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Operation Tuleta (into other forms of computer hacking). These and other subsidiary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigations are proceeding apace and, during the course of the Inquiry, there have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a large number of arrests with journalists and others being bailed for further inquiries to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made. In a number of cases,criminal prosecutions have been commenced; these are presently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">awaiting trial and I anticipate that there will continue to be developments in the period which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">follows the publication of this Report. This is the reason for the Inquiry being split into two</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parts (with the question &#8220;who did what to whom&#8221; generally falling within Part 2, which is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intended to follow the conclusion of any criminal prosecutions). One consequence, however,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is that any investigation of the facts has inevitably been circumscribed, in particular, by an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inability to investigate the full detail of specific criminality in the core areas of interception of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mobile telephone voice mail messages and alleged bribery of public officials.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This limitation must be put in context. Concern about this type of activity constituted an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important factor leading to the establishment of this Inquiry and the issue cannot be ignored:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is one of the central reasons for public concern about the conduct of the press (or sections</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of it). In relation to each of those who have been charged or arrested, however, criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proceedings are active (within the meaning of the Contempt of Court Act 1981).</span>


</span>
<span class="newpage">

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This has two consequences, the implications of which are important. First, to avoid prejudice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to any criminal investigation or prosecution, there are inevitable limitations on the extent to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which it is appropriate to examine the evidence relating to specific incidents of such practices,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">let alone in relation to the identification of those who might have been involved. Second, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rights of those who have been charged or arrested must be respected and, in particular, their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">right not to self incriminate must be protected. This could arise either by the Inquiry inviting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">answers to potentially incriminating questions or, inferentially, by putting them in a position</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that refusal to answer questions itself generates suspicion. In the circumstances, none of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those who have been arrested has been asked questions about interception of voice mail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">messages or payments to public officials.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> Taking full account of these issues, however, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rights of individuals do not mean that it is inappropriate to consider, as a matter of generality,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the extent to which there was a recognised and understood willingness to obtain information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in this way albeit in some cases, perhaps, without knowledge of (or, at the very least, due</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regard to) the relevant criminal law.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In any event, Part 1 of the Terms of Reference covers very much more than this activity. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to the press and the public, quite apart from the admirable journalism conducted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">entirely in the public interest, and journalism which sets out simply to entertain harming</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nobody, its culture, practices and ethics cover many other types of conduct which have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been the subject of complaint. Without intending to create a definitive list, these include</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deception (&#8216;blagging&#8217;), bullying (by reporters of members of the public and by editors of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reporters in order to obtain stories), breaches of privacy and harassment, other forms of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intrusion, misleading or inaccurate stories or headlines whether deliberate or accidental,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discrimination and other conduct that breaches the Editors&#8217; Code of Conduct.</span>
<h4>Scope</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This Inquiry has covered the &#8220;culture, practices and ethics of the press&#8221; which obviously</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">includes newspapers whether printed or online: it does not include broadcasters (ultimately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulated by Ofcom). Thus, although the Director General of the BBC, then Mark Thompson,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gaveevidence,hedidsoonlytoprovideacomparisonbetweentheapproachadoptedinternally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the BBC Trust along with the oversight from Ofcom. In those circumstances, although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there have been many calls during the Inquiry for me to expand the terms of reference to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigate other organisations (most recently the BBC in the wake of the allegations against</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Jimmy Savile), it is simply outside the Terms of Reference within which I am working.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Part 1 also covers the culture, practices and ethics of the press across a far wider canvass than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the way in which it deals with the public. It is concerned with the relationship between the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press and the police. This encompasses allegations that the two have become far too close,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involving the payment of money or the provision of other favours for inside information,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prior notice of newsworthy incidents or participation in high profile operations (including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">presence at arrests). It also covers the cross fertilisation of employment with retired senior</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police officers being engaged as newspaper columnists and journalists being employed in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PR departments or as PR advisers by police services. Part 1 also deals with the relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between the press and politicians including, in particular, the perception that, in return for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political support, politicians have been too ready to allow undue influence to be exercised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to policy and that, in any event, the relationship between the two has not been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transparent.</span>


</span>
<span class="newpage">

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Taken together, this remit is almost breathtaking in its width and, from the beginning, I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been extremely conscious of a number of very significant consequences of the task that I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undertaken and the need to cope with those consequences. First, it would be all too easy to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allow an investigation of the issues to spiral out of control and to become far too enmeshed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in detail at the expense of the overall picture. Examples could be provided of concerns which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">focus on individual aspects of the Inquiry and it would be entirely legitimate to subject each</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to detailed analysis, providing the opportunity to anyone affected or potentially affected to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">challenge the inferences to be drawn. In some cases, for good reason, detail at that level has,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indeed, been necessary. The contrary approach, with no attention paid to specifics, would risk</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">creating an overview that is far too general and has little value as a true narrative of events.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-10"><a href="#para1-10" name="para1-10">1.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The need to ensure a balanced approach to the facts has to be reflected in the context of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">second consideration. That is the broad time frame within which it important for me to report.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I put it in that way because, without suggesting that the period of one year identified by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prime Minister constitutes (or was intended to constitute) a straight-jacket, the imperative to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deal with this issue is real; public concern at the time of the closure of the News of the World</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(NoTW) was intense and it is important to address the problems that were perceived and are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">now recognised in relation to the regulation of the press as a matter of urgency.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-11"><a href="#para1-11" name="para1-11">1.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In any event, this consideration chimes with the question of cost. At a time of fiscal austerity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the public and increasing pressure on the commerciality of the newspaper industry, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was always important that time and the resources of both were well used and not wasted on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an analysis of detail that was too extensive and unnecessary for the purposes of providing a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficient narrative. Cost is not just about legal and other financial outlay, whether by Core</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Participant members of the public who do not qualify for legal assistance, public authorities</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such as the police or police authorities, the newspaper industry or the Ministries required to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fund the running of the Inquiry. Cost also encompasses the energy and time commitment of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all whether participant or witness, both in responding to calls for evidence (which, in some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cases, has involved an enormous amount of work) or attending to give oral evidence.</span>
<h4>Engagement</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-12"><a href="#para1-12" name="para1-12">1.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The third consideration has been my anxiety to ensure that the industry is fully engaged in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the process and to avoid the risk that this imposed Inquiry requires or has meant that their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only role is to be reactive or, perhaps more serious, entirely defensive. In that regard, one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern (evidenced in fact) has been that parts of the press would consider that I approached</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry without the necessary and, in my view, entirely appropriate enthusiasm and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">absolute commitment to freedom of expression and the independence of the press; and that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this concern would fashion their approach to the Inquiry, impact on the assistance that they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provided and colour the way in which they viewed any conclusion I might reach. A subsidiary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern has been that whatever view I might have about these fundamental freedoms, I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would change them in the light of what they perceive to be unbalanced evidence of problems.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of course, as many have reported, it has been inevitable that a large body of the evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be uncomfortable for the press, if not worse, and that the positive features of our</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press both at a national and regional level would be lost in the welter of criticism, although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reflective consideration will demonstrate that any Inquiry of this nature will inevitably focus</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the problems. As I will repeat at various stages throughout this Report, I am very conscious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that most journalism, most of the time meets high standards and can compete with the best</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalism in the world; the Inquiry has been concerned with that which does not.</span>

</span>
<span class="newpage">

<p id="para-id-1-13"><a href="#para1-13" name="para1-13">1.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The fourth consideration has been the interests of the public. I have made the point that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public interest in the issues identified in the Terms of Reference is intense and, in my</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">judgment, correctly so. It has thus been vital to ensure that the Inquiry proceeded in a way</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that engaged the public and provided appropriate access to it. By access, I do not mean only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the hearing of the Inquiry would be in public for that goes without saying. The concern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been to find ways, first, of providing the public with information as to the framework</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of law and regulation within which the press operate; second, of ensuring that the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has maximum access to the evidence and the material which forms the basis of my Report;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">third, of allowing and encouraging the public to feed their views into the Inquiry without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">losing the necessary judicial rigour with which any Inquiry must be conducted or creating the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perception that I am effectively engaged in what is little more than a substantial exercise in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public consultation.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-14"><a href="#para1-14" name="para1-14">1.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I approached these problems in a number of different ways which I explain in chronological</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">order of them being put into practice. In order to provide some coherence to the evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and so that the public could understand the approach of the Inquiry, the Terms of Reference</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were split into four modules: the Press and the Public, the Press and the Police, the Press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the Politicians and, finally, the Future. The first three modules were designed to provide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the platform for focused evidence broadly dealing with the topic in question. I say &#8216;broadly&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because I have not wanted to trouble witnesses with necessarily having to return to give</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence for each module. Thus, during the module concerned with the Press and the Public,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">therelevanteditorswereaskedaboutpaymentsorotherinducementstopoliceofficers(which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is Module Two), along with questions about meetings with and influence upon politicians.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Conversely, certain witnesses (and, in particular, Rupert Murdoch, James Murdoch, Rebekah</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Brooks and Andrew Coulson) were, or at least could be (subject to allowance in the cases of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mrs Brooks and Mr Coulson to the fact that, at the time they gave evidence, they had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arrested as part of the police investigation and have now both been charged) central to a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of modules and I took the view that it was more sensible to deal with all aspects of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry towards the conclusion of the oral evidence.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-15"><a href="#para1-15" name="para1-15">1.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, the fourth module (the Future) was not intended, as might have been thought,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be free-standing. From the outset, I have been concerned to challenge all or most of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">witnesses to provide ideas for the future. I have then tested them with other witnesses and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">encouraged a continued dialogue between all those affected by the issues which are the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subject matter of the Inquiry. In that way, I have endeavoured to ensure that, parallel to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry, others (including the industry, academic journalists and those interested in this area)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">engage in dialogues to ensure that all possible mechanisms for regulation are examined and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered. The purpose of Module Four, therefore, was to test possible approaches and so</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ensure that the final Report did as much as it possibly could to take account of all concerns</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and reflect a solution that not only balances the legitimate interests of all those affected by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the way in which the press goes about its business, but also provides a solution, or series of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">solutions, that have been submitted to rigorous analysis and, hopefully, can work in the real</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">world.</span>
<h4>Briefing sessions</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-16"><a href="#para1-16" name="para1-16">1.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition to splitting the Terms of Reference into four modules, I took other steps to provide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficient bedrock on which to build consideration of the evidence as to the need for change</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the future. Having signalled my intentions and rejected submissions that it would not be</span>

</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate to proceed in this way,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> the second preliminary step was to organise a series of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">briefing sessions to set out the technical, legal and regulatory framework both for me and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the assessors.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-17"><a href="#para1-17" name="para1-17">1.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although running contrary to my fundamental approach to the Inquiry, I agreed that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">technical briefing (to explain methods of interception of telephone and IT systems) should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conducted in private, on the basis that there was no justification for putting into the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">domain methods whereby the unscrupulous could learn how to commit what are, in fact,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal offences. An approved summary of that briefing is, however, available and has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">posted on the website. The other briefings concerned the criminal and civil law framework</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within which the press operate and the regulatory framework, both in relation to the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(presently through the Press Complaints Commission PCC) and also in other, comparatively</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">related, industries. Although these briefings were not recorded, transcripts were prepared</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and anyone interested in the subject matter of the Inquiry has been in a position to acquaint</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">themselves with the framework of law and regulation in order better to understand the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues that the Inquiry intended to address. These briefings are not formal parts of the record</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Inquiry; I am, however, satisfied that they accurately reflected the current position</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, where those who provided them gave evidence, they were happy to incorporate into the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">record what they said at the briefings.</span>
<h4>Seminars</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-18"><a href="#para1-18" name="para1-18">1.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The third preliminary step, after the briefing sessions, was to seek to widen understanding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the background and the present state of the industry while at the same time distilling</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the issues and starting the debate. This was taken forward by three seminars held over two</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">full days. Again, these seminars are not formal parts of the record but, again, in the case</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of all those who gave presentations or otherwise contributed and who later attended to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">give evidence, each attested to the accuracy of what he or she then said and accepted that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their contribution should be taken as part of their evidence. In each case, after a formal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">presentation, there was an open debate before an invited audience. The seminars were</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first set of seminars, on Thursday 6 October 2011, was called &#8220;The Competitive Pressures</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the Press and the Impact on Journalism&#8221;. It was chaired by Sir David Bell, supported by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Elinor Goodman and George Jones, and received presentations from Claire Enders of Enders</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Analysis on the competitive pressures facing the press today; Phil Hall (former editor of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW, Hello! Magazine and director of the editorial department at Trinity Mirror plc) on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">how the press operates in a competitive environment and the pressures facing editors; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Richard Peppiatt (formerly a reporter on the Daily Star) on the day to day effect of competitive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressuresonworkingjournalists.Thesecondseminar,similarlychaired,wascalled&#8220;TheRights</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Responsibilities of the Press&#8221; and received first a presentation from Alan Rusbridger</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(editor-in-chief of the Guardian) on why a free press matters. This was followed by Trevor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Kavanagh (formerly political editor and now an associate editor and political columnist on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Sun) and Professor Brian Cathcart (formerly deputy editor of The Independent on Sunday</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and now Professor of Journalism at Kingston University and a founder of the Hacked Off</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">campaign), both of whom spoke about whether there is a difference between the public</span>



</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest and the interest of the public and what questions this raised in relation to a single set</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of journalistic ethics.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-20"><a href="#para1-20" name="para1-20">1.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second day of seminars was held on Wednesday 12 October 2011. The third seminar</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was called &#8220;Supporting a free press and high standards &#8211; Approaches to Regulation&#8221;. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">morning was chaired by Lord Currie, supported by Shami Chakrabarti. Presentations were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provided on the future for self regulation from the different perspectives of a regulator, an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editor and a user by Eve Salomon (a former PCC Commissioner and currently Chair of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Internet Watch Foundation), Paul Dacre (editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers Ltd and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">chair of the Editors&#8217; Code Committee of the PCC) and Will Moy (Director of Full Fact, an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent fact-checking organisation) respectively. The role of corporate governance was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered by Lord Borrie (formerly Director General of Fair Trading and thereafter Chair of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Advertising Standards Authority), Stephen Hill (formerly Chief Executive Officer of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Financial Times and now a non-executive director of Channel Four television) and Sly Bailey</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(then Chief Executive of Trinity Mirror plc).</span>

<p id="para-id-1-21"><a href="#para1-21" name="para1-21">1.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the afternoon, chaired by Shami Chakrabarti supported by Lord Currie, redress for breach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of standards was discussed by Professor Steven Barnett (Professor of Communications at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the University of Westminster), Desmond Browne QC (a leading media silk and formerly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chairman of the Bar)<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> and Professor Robert Baldwin (Professor of Law at the London School</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Economics specialising in regulation). Finally defending freedom of expression was the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subject of presentations by John Kampfner (then Chief Executive of Index on Censorship),</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Professor James Curran (Professor of Communications at Goldsmiths, University of London</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Chair of the Co-ordinating Committee for Media Reform) and Kelvin MacKenzie (a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">columnist for The Sun and the Daily Mail, formerly editor of The Sun and managing director</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of BskyB and Mirror Group Newspapers).</span>

<p id="para-id-1-22"><a href="#para1-22" name="para1-22">1.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not necessary to summarise the views expressed either in the presentations or by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">others who contributed to the seminars. To such extent as they have been incorporated into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the record of the Inquiry (which, during the course of subsequent evidence, most have), they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will be reflected in the analysis that follows. What is important to emphasise, however, is that,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with very limited exception, all the speakers saw and took the opportunity of the seminars to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">analyse where recent events were leading and had led the business, industry or profession of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalism; in my view, this did a great deal to open up the issues to a wider audience.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-23"><a href="#para1-23" name="para1-23">1.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Without minimising any contribution from any speaker, I particularly mention Mr Dacre who,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">while challenging the justification upon which the Inquiry was set up (including the credentials</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of those participating in it), identifying what he described as paradoxes in the current furore</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">over the press and seeking to de-bunk what he called myths surrounding the PCC, went on to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognise the need for reform if trust was to be regained and made a number of suggestions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which openly and emphatically started the debate as to the future. This was a very important</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognition of the need for change which, coming from an extremely important player in the</span>


</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry, was of enormous value. It is a matter of record that, as he was perfectly entitled to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">do, he later resiled from at least one of the suggestions that he then made.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-24"><a href="#para1-24" name="para1-24">1.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These seminars had another value, which was to allow me to signal (as I have repeated many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">times throughout the Inquiry) that I saw the best solution as one that both the press and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public would accept as a realistic approach to the issue of regulation. The recognition that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC no longer held the confidence of the public (whatever might have been the position in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the past) was a vital stepping stone to identifying a system that would achieve the legitimate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aims of the press while, at the same time, satisfying the legitimate aspirations of the public. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is obviously important that the system works for the press and that, preferably, it is acceptable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to them. However, it is even more important &#8211; indeed critical &#8211; that it works for the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the sense that the public accept that the press are able to pursue legitimate investigative</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">journalismthatisinthepublicinterest,but,atthesametime,canbeheldtoaccountforabuses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the freedoms which they have to pursue stories which have no discernible public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and whether those abuses are criminal, tortuous, or merely contrary to any recognised code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of legitimate journalistic practice. I believed that the editorial representatives of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appreciated that, if it was accepted that the PCC could no longer continue as it had, this goal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was a fundamental requirement of the Inquiry.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-25"><a href="#para1-25" name="para1-25">1.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I ought to add that I initially intended to hold further seminars for different aspects of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">work of the Inquiry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> In the event, as evidence became available, I decided that the impetus</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which had been the extremely valuable result of the first series of seminars did not require</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">repetition. It was sufficient for public understanding of the work of the Inquiry and its direction</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for Counsel, Robert Jay QC, to open each module in turn, explaining precisely what it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intended to achieve and the direction that the Inquiry would take. That understanding was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also aided by the identification and publication of key issues for each of the modules which,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in turn, generated public response.</span>
<h4>Broadcasting</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-26"><a href="#para1-26" name="para1-26">1.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The fourth preliminary step in relation to the broad approach concerned the extent to which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it would be appropriate to allow cameras into the Inquiry room to record the evidence and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thereafter to stream it live onto the Inquiry website. On the one hand, I was conscious that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it would create pressure on witnesses who wished to protect their privacy and, as a result of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the presence of a permanent record of their evidence, could serve to undermine that privacy.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It would also serve to increase the day to day pressure on Counsel and all others participating</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the work of the Inquiry. On the other hand, I recognised the significant public interest in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what the Inquiry was doing and seeking to achieve, along with the very real importance in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ensuring that the evidence was available for all to see in a form that was unmediated by press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or other reporting. I dealt with my concern in relation to the witnesses who complained of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press intrusion by ensuring that all who gave oral evidence were volunteers and understood</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that their evidence would be streamed on the website and available to be seen in the future;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is for that reason that I particularly recognised the value of their participation when each</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gave evidence.</span>



</span>
<span class="newpage">

<p id="para-id-1-27"><a href="#para1-27" name="para1-27">1.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the event, I am satisfied that the decision to stream the work of the Inquiry (and to enter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into appropriate contractual relationships with television broadcasters as to the use to which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it may be put) was entirely justified. Sky News and the BBC devoted a considerable proportion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of time to televising the hearings and other media news channels used the footage both on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">television and as part of their online reporting.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-28"><a href="#para1-28" name="para1-28">1.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When dealing with the topic of televising the Inquiry, it is important to sound a note of caution.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am conscious that a number of people have used the valuable impact of the reporting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Inquiry in support of the argument that all court proceedings should be capable of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being televised and that the present restrictions contained within s41 of the Criminal Justice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Act 1925 should be removed. Although the experience of the Inquiry can inform any such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">debate, it is important to provide the context. The press and other professional witnesses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were subject of notice under s21 of the Inquiries Act 2005 (and so were required to provide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence and, when appropriate, attend the Inquiry). However, as I have said, the witnesses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who complained about press intrusion were volunteers and understood that their evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be streamed and available on the website; cross examination was limited or non-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">existent. In very few cases, steps were taken to preserve anonymity of appearance if not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identity. In a criminal trial or family proceedings, civilian witnesses are victims, involved in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal tragedy or accidental (and, in many cases, reluctant) participants in the process</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of justice; they can be cross examined at length and, frequently, as to their credit. To film</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their evidence (particularly in high profile cases) would be to subject them to intolerable and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">damaging pressure which would most certainly not be in the interests of justice.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-29"><a href="#para1-29" name="para1-29">1.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Returning to the impact of the other preliminary steps that I have outlined, the briefings and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the seminars had the intended effect. In addition to eliciting responses from those who were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">either invited to provide evidence or, pursuant to notice under s21 of the Inquiries Act 2005,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were required to do so, many other interested parties and the members of the public did</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">engage in the process of the Inquiry.</span>
<h4>Core Participants</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-30"><a href="#para1-30" name="para1-30">1.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Running at the same time as the briefings and seminars, as a fifth preliminary step, it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary to determine who should be entitled to Core Participant status for any or all of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the modules of the Inquiry and to decide how the Inquiry should proceed in the light of any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">representations that Core Participants might make. I decided to separate out applications</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for Core Participant status for each of the four modules, on the basis that although many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interested parties would have equal interest in all aspects of the Inquiry (and so were granted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on a blanket basis from the outset), a number might only be concerned with fewer aspects of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Terms of Reference. In the circumstances, I invited applications for each of the modules</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and dealt with them on that basis. Although deadlines for such applications passed, in the</span>

</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-size: 15px;">main, I considered each, whenever it was made, on its merits and ruled in accordance with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the letter and spirit of Rule 5(2) of the Inquiry Rules 2006.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></span>
<h4>The approach to evidence</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-31"><a href="#para1-31" name="para1-31">1.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The sixth, and final, preliminary issue concerned the steps that I should take, while seeking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to obtain a narrative of facts, to ensure that I did not prejudice any criminal investigation or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potential prosecution and, at the same time, maintain a balanced and fair approach to others</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said to have been involved in illegal or unethical methods of gathering stories. In relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the former, having invited submissions at an early stage (in particular from the Director</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Public Prosecutions and the police), I ruled on the appropriate approach to evidence in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to those charged with criminal offences or under investigation. My conclusion is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">summarised at para 1.16 above.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> Fairness (as required by s17(3) of the Inquiries Act 2005)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has, however, taken me further for I have not felt it appropriate to protect the names of those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who have been arrested from being linked to specific allegations of criminal conduct, while</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">affording no such protection for those alleged to have been involved in other criminal (or, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some cases, unethical) conduct which is not being investigated (and therefore gives rise to no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">risk of prejudice).</span>

<p id="para-id-1-32"><a href="#para1-32" name="para1-32">1.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This approach has been criticised by those who wish to expose what is said to be the greater</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminality revealed by a study of the documents seized by the Information Commissioner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">during Operation Motorman (the arrest of a private detective, Steve Whittamore), involving</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a very much greater section of the press than those seized by the police during Operation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Caryatid (the arrest of Glenn Mulcaire, now being revisited in Operation Weeting). However,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is entirely consistent with the fact that the Terms of Reference are divided into two parts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that this first Part concerns the culture, practices and ethics of the press rather than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual conduct. Throughout the Inquiry, there are references to what I have described</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as the &#8216;mantra&#8217; that I have not presently been concerned with &#8216;who did what to whom&#8217; but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">culture practices and ethics. To the mantra, I have added what I have called the &#8216;self-denying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ordinance&#8217; that, although the Inquiry has investigated with individual journalists conduct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which is not the subject (or likely to be the subject) of police inquiries, so that the question of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">self incrimination does not arise, in the main, I have extended similar protection to individual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists and others who are not currently the subject of any investigations.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> This approach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has not been inflexible because it has been critically important to ensure that an appropriate</span>




</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-size: 15px;">narrative of fact is available, against which to judge the efficacy of the present system of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">self regulation promulgated through the Press Complaints Commission and any proposals to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">amend or replace that system.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-33"><a href="#para1-33" name="para1-33">1.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I can illustrate this necessary inhibition on what I have been able to do with a simple example.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his first statement to the Inquiry, the editor of The Times, James Harding, made a passing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reference to a single instance of computer hacking. This was not investigated further at that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">time but, in a masterly analysis, David Allan Green linked the reference to the exposure of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">bloggerknownasNightjack.ThatledtoaletterandafurtherstatementfromMrHardingwhich</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resulted in his being recalled to give evidence. Because the Nightjack incident had been the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subject of litigation, the then legal manager of The Times, Mr Alastair Brett, appeared at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry when the matter was analysed in some detail. On the basis of this evidence, it would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">certainly be possible to draw a number of important conclusions about what happened at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Times and about internal governance and legal risk management. However, because the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalist who was said to be at the centre of this incident has now been arrested for offences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of computer hacking and attempting to pervert the course of justice, it is not appropriate to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">risk prejudice to that investigation or to any possible trial by further discussing it.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-34"><a href="#para1-34" name="para1-34">1.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A further consequence of this has been the need to avoid the possibility of inferential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criticism of those who are currently the subject of criminal investigations. So, for example,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a criticism of the governance arrangements at a particular newspaper, whether in general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terms or directed at particular members of the management team, could, by implication,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be interpreted as a criticism of others, elsewhere within the organisation. The requirement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on me to tread this careful path might mean that some readers of this Report are surprised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that a number of senior executives who gave evidence are not subject to the criticisms that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might otherwise have been expected or, at least, discussed. It is, however, the consequence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the imperative not to or cause substantial prejudice to the investigation or prosecution of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allegations of crime.</span>

<h2>2. The gathering and presentation of evidence</h2>
<h4>Module One</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As I have explained, many public inquiries follow some incident or event which has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">immediately been the subject of police or other investigation, so that the product of that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation will be able to form the basis body of evidence upon which the inquiry can rely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for its facts. In the case of this Inquiry, however, although aspects of the Terms of Reference</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been or were the subject of litigation,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup> the police investigation was ongoing. Although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry obtained evidence both from the civil and public law actions, the collection of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence even for Module One (the press and the public) required trawling from a very wide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">range of people including (a) individuals who complained that they have been the subject</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of press criminality or intrusion (one of whom gave evidence with the benefit of complete</span>


</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-size: 15px;">anonymity),<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup> (b) newspaper proprietors, editors, journalists<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup> and support staff (including, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to News International, external lawyers), (c) freelance journalists, campaign groups</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and others who have been concerned about press conduct, (d) photographers (including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">paparazzi) and private detectives, (e) mobile phone operators, (f) the police and Director of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Public Prosecutions, (g) the Information Commissioner and his staff, (h) the Press Complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commission, (i) academic journalists and (j) bloggers and internet sites. The remaining</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">modules required different groups of people or different individuals within the relevant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisations.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Section 21(2) of the Inquiries Act 2005 provides that I could require any person, within such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">period as appears to be reasonable to provide evidence in the form of a written statement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(including documents). For each module, save in relation to those who complained about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press intrusion (whom I considered ought to have the opportunity to decline to give evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in public about their complaints of invasions of privacy) and a number of the most senior</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians, I decided that all witnesses would be required pursuant to the Act to assist me:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this was not intended to reflect a concern that witnesses would not be prepared to volunteer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their assistance (as, I believe almost without exception, all were) but rather to ensure that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was a consistency of approach across all those whom the Inquiry approached. Such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requests could only be made after the Inquiry had formally commenced (at the end of July</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2011) and it was obviously essential to give everyone to whom requests for evidence had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been addressed sufficient time to submit considered evidence. Given the summer, this meant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that most of the evidence was not, in fact, available until the autumn. It then had to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assimilated and, eventually, made available to Core Participants for any comment prior to it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being called.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition to witnesses whom the Inquiry approached, an invitation was posted on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">website inviting members of the public and other interested individuals or groups to submit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence directly to the Inquiry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup> It is worth setting out the key questions posed which were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as follows:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Inquiry is currently looking at the relationship between the press and the public.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We&#8217;re interested in hearing from professionals and the public with information and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">examples in response to the specific questions below.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Your answers may be considered as potential evidence to the inquiry.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">1. The Inquiry needs to understand how newsrooms operate, particularly in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">tabloid and mid-market sectors. Can you provide a personal account of culture,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">practices and ethics in any part of the press and media?</span>



</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2. Seminar debates have suggested that commercial pressures were not new, were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not unique to the press, and did not impact adversely on standards of journalism</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or ethical behaviour. The Inquiry would be interested in submissions on this, with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">examples where possible.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">3. Some seminar attendees suggest reader loyalty limits competition between titles.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Professional competition to be first or best with a story, though, could be a powerful</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">force. Other participants suggested some papers put journalists under significant</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pressure to produce a story within a tight timeframe. The Inquiry would be interested</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in experiences of the competitive dynamics in journalism and how that impacts on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the way in which journalists operate, with examples where possible.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">4. With the advent of the internet and 24 hour news as well as declines in revenue</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and circulation, we have heard that fewer journalists are having to do more work.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The seminars also raised the issue of the casualisation of the workforce. The inquiry</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would be interested in experiences of how this may have changed the culture in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newsrooms and what it might mean in terms of journalistic practice, with examples</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">where possible.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">5. The issue of stories that attract a high degree of press attention but subsequently</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">turn out to be false was raised at the seminars. The Inquiry would be interested in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">submissions from editors, reporters and subjects of such stories - why they occur (what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are the pressures that drive press interest), and how they occur (what checks and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">balances are or should be in place to stop this happening and why do they sometimes</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not operate)?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">6. One seminar attendee suggested that the National Council for the Training of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Journalists does not teach ethics. The Inquiry would be interested in experience of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">how ethics are taught and promulgated amongst journalists.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">Standards</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">7. Attendees proposed that the general law, as it applies to everyone, should be the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">only constraint on the press. The inquiry would welcome submissions on whether,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and if so why, the press should be subject to any additional constraints in relation to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">behaviour and standards, for example relating to accuracy, treatment of vulnerable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">individuals, intrusion, financial reporting or reporting on crime, other than those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">imposed by existing laws.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">8. Editors at the seminars argued that the Editors&#8217; Code was a good set of standards</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to work to. The Inquiry would be interested in submissions from all parties on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">coverage and substance of the Editors&#8217; code including accuracy and redress for those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who are affected by breaches of the code.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">9. Ithas been argued that the statutory regulation and impartiality requirements that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">apply to broadcasting do not chill investigative reporting on television. Broadcasters</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are able to rely on the printed press to break controversial stories and then follow</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on behind. The inquiry would be interested in submissions on the extent to which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the regulatory regime for broadcasting casts a chill on broadcast reporting and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the relationship between the printed press and broadcast media as a result of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">different regulatory environments.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">Public interest</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">10. The Inquiry has heard strong arguments for the importance of a free press in a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">democratic society. The Inquiry would be interested in submissions on the special role</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to be played by the press in a democracy, what &#8216;freedom&#8217; requirements need to be</span>

</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in place for that role to be played and the whether this role places any obligations or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">responsibilities on the press.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">11. We&#8217;ve heard arguments that sometimes it will be in the public interest for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalists and media organisations to do things that would otherwise be ethically or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">legally questionable. The inquiry would be interested in submissions on the extent to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which, if at all, should acting in the public interest be a complete or partial defence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in relation to unlawful or unethical activity in pursuit of journalism; and, if so, subject</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to what conditions.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">12. In practice any public interest argument would need to be considered in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">context of specific cases. The Inquiry would be interested in submissions on who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should be responsible for reaching decisions on whether something is in the public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interest, and on what basis.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Illustrative examples would be helpful.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It has been suggested that the Inquiry never engaged with the public, and therefore never</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">engaged with those who purchase tabloid or mid-market papers, with the result that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence has been in some sense skewed or biased against the millions who read that type of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">paper. In fact, as discussed below, members of the public (with different interests in the work</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Inquiry) did respond to this invitation and it proved an extremely valuable resource for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">materialwhichtheInquirywouldnototherwisehaveobtained.Further,anumberofwitnesses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and groups who availed themselves of the opportunity to provide views and material were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">later invited to attend to give evidence orally so as to develop the issues which had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">raised. As for the risk that only those with some criticism of the press might respond, as the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">questions make clear, the Inquiry was equally anxious to hear in support of the press as in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criticism of it.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The briefings, seminars, and the collection, examination and distillation of the evidence meant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it was not possible to start the formal hearings of the Inquiry until Monday 14 November</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2011, when Robert Jay QC made an opening statement, followed by opening statements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the Core Participants. Witness evidence commenced on Monday 21 November 2011</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, for Module One, continued until 9 February 2012: 175 witnesses gave evidence over</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a period of 40 days and the evidence of further witnesses was read into the record of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry not only while Module One was ongoing but also, as it emerged, throughout the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry and, where appropriate, even after the formal hearings had concluded. This latter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">process has given rise to misunderstanding which I have frequently sought to correct during</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the course of the Inquiry but which it is appropriate to make very clear.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">While the evidence on Module 1 was proceeding, a number of submissions were received</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from campaigning groups who argued that the approach of the PCC to third party complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was such that there was no avenue for redress in the absence of a identified &#8216;victim&#8217; who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was prepared to pursue a complaint on his or her own behalf. In particular, therefore, generic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints (of misleading and inaccurate reporting of issues such as immigration, domestic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">violence and others) were unchallengeable. This was not simply a complaint about tone or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">balance (although there were such concerns as well) because it was well understood that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers, unlike broadcasters, were perfectly entitled to be partisan in their views. Rather,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was to do with factual accuracy and consequent comment. To that end, arrangements were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made for evidence to be given from, among others, Inayat Bunglawala (Engage), Heather</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Harvey (Eaves Housing for Women), Anna Van Heeswijk (OBJECT), Jacqui Hunt (Equality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Now), Marai Larasi (End Violence against Women) and Helen Belcher (Transmedia Watch).</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As explained by Fiona Fox (Science Media Centre) misleading and inaccurate reporting of</span>

</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-size: 15px;">conceptual issues (such as climate change or science generally) were similarly not covered by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the complaints system.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Submissions from different groups continued to be received covering other areas of extremely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important social awareness; these included, among others, submissions concerning the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">treatment afforded by the press to the young, the mentally ill, the disabled and other groups</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in society, some of which were vulnerable and others the particular subject of press concern.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">All make the same or similar points to those which the Inquiry had already heard, albeit from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the different perspective of the particular concern of that specific campaign. Quite apart from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the question of the available time (given the very wide-ranging Terms of Reference and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other evidence that it was essential to capture), the question arose whether it was necessary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to call this evidence orally in order to make the points that were developed in writing.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the event, I decided that it was not necessary to call more evidence; however, arrangements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were made for each of these submissions (as with all other evidence read into the Inquiry)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be circulated to Core Participants so that if any advanced a reason why the evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should not received into the record of the Inquiry, that argument could be considered. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the event, no objection was received and all this evidence was &#8216;read into&#8217; the Inquiry record.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That means that it is published as part of the evidence of the Inquiry: I have read it and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where appropriate, included references to parts of it in this Report. What I am very anxious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to emphasise, however, is that I do not consider that any of this evidence was &#8216;second class&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or to be accorded a lesser status to the evidence that was adduced orally: it has all been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important and it has all been considered. The same can be said of the submissions to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry made by others (not necessarily relating to campaigning groups concerned with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">third party complaints) which, having also been read into the record, has become part of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence in the Inquiry.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As I deal with evidence that was read into the record but not called before me, I ought also to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deal with complaints that were made to the Inquiry that were not adduced as evidence, not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because they were not relevant to the Terms of Reference but, rather, because they were both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complex and highly fact-sensitive. This would have resulted in a considerable amount of time</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being devoted to investigating the circumstances, without there being any corresponding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">value to be derived as to the generic culture, practices and ethics of the press (rather than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the behaviour of those titles involved in the particular facts being examined). One example</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will suffice.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In March 1997, a private investigator, Daniel Morgan was murdered in South East London.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There have been five police inquiries into the circumstances of his death and it has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">alleged that his partner, Jonathan Rees, might have been involved in his murder (he was later</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acquitted when the prosecution were unable to guarantee his right to a fair trial following the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discovery by the police of four undisclosed crates of material). Mr Rees had been employed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the NoTW and, the nature of the relationship has been the subject of media comment. I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can well understand why Mr Morgan&#8217;s family saw the Inquiry as an opportunity to uncover</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information about his death (and Mr Rees clearly visualised that possibility because he</span>


</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-size: 15px;">applied for Core Participant status on the basis that he might be the subject of criticism).</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whether there should be an inquiry into this particular case is not for me to say: it is sufficient</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if I repeat the explanation that to have examined the issues arising would have taken weeks</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or months and I did not consider that the very limited time available for this Inquiry was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">best deployed in that way. In the event, although I made it clear that Mr Rees could make a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statement for the Inquiry, he has not done so.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></span>
<h4>Module Two</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That conveniently brings me to Module Two which started on 27 February 2012. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence touching the relationship between the press and the police had been obtained and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assimilated while Module One was proceeding. Once again, key questions for this module</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were also published on the website<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup> which, again, generated considerable public interest.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The questions (which provide a good overview of some of the issues which the Inquiry was to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consider in this module) were as follows:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Inquiry is now looking at the relationship between the press and the police.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We&#8217;re interested in hearing from professionals and the public with information and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">examples in response to the specific questions below. Your answers may be considered</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as potential evidence to the Inquiry and may be published in a redacted form as part</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the Inquiry&#8217;s evidence.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Culture, practices and ethics<span style="font-weight:normal"> :</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">1. The Inquiry needs to understand how the relationship between the press and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">police currently operates. The Inquiry would be interested in the experiences of police</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">officers, other police staff, and journalists as to how the relationship between the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press and the police works in practice.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2. The Inquiry would be interested in the experiences of police officers, other police</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">staff, and journalists as to how the current Police Service policies and guidance in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">place to regulate the relationship between the press and the police work in practice.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">3. The Inquiry would like to build up an overall picture of the nature and level of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the interaction that currently exists between the police and the press. The Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would therefore be interested to receive submissions on the type and frequency of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contact which currently exists between police officers, other police staff, and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">media (differentiating between local and national media contact), with examples</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">where possible.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">4. The internet, 24 hour news and social media has brought new challenges for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">both the police and the press. The Inquiry would be interested in the experiences of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">police officers, other police staff, and journalists on how this may have altered the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relationship, and whether the Police Service policies and guidance in place have kept</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pace with this changing environment, with examples where possible.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">5. The Inquiry would be interested to receive views on the level of awareness and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">experience that exists within the Police Service of &#8220;media crime&#8221; (the unlawful</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interception of communications, bribery of officials by the media and harassment by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">paparazzi and journalists, for example), with examples where possible.</span>



</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">6. The Inquiry would be interested to receive views as to whether the Police Service</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">governance arrangements, policies and guidance currently in place are sufficient to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sustain a transparent and ethical relationship between the police and the press which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at the same time upholds the confidentiality and rights of the victims of crime and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public more generally.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">7. The Inquiry would be interested to receive submissions on what Police Service</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">training, governance and oversight arrangements exist, and views on whether it is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sufficient, to ensure that acceptable boundaries exist between the police and press,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with examples where possible.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">8. The Inquiry would be interested in the experiences of journalists about whether</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you have ever felt under any pressure not to report a story involving a police officer</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or member of police staff (detailing where and from whom the pressure came), with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">examples where possible.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">9. The Inquiry would be interested to receive submissions from police officers, other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">police staff, and journalists on the extent to which formal and informal interaction</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">between the press and the police is recorded for the purposes of transparency (are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">such records audited, and if so by whom, for example). Information control and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">disclosure:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">10. The Inquiry would be interested to receive submissions on the extent to which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">systems are in place (and an assessment of whether they are adequate) to identify,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">prevent, manage and investigate police data leaks and breaches.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">11. The Inquiry would be interested in the experiences of the victims of crime and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the public more generally, who feel that they have been adversely affected (perhaps</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">through a data leak or breach, or through the reporting of a case) by the current</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relationship between the press and the police, with examples where possible. The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Inquiry would also be interested to receive submissions in relation to this issue on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whether it is felt that the current investigation and complaint regime are adequate to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">properly address instances of this type.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">12. The Inquiry would welcome submissions on how the police and the media working</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">together is and can be of benefit to the public, with examples where possible.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">Professional Standards<span style="font-weight:normal"> :</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">13. The Inquiry would like to receive views as to whether it is felt that adequate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">governance and oversight arrangements are in place for police officers and other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">police staff to ensure the effective management and recording of gifts and hospitality,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">secondary business interests, associations and conflicts of interest.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">14. The Inquiry would be interested to receive views as to what type of payments,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">gifts or hospitality (if any) you consider to be legitimate transactions between</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">police officers, other police staff, and the media, and is and should the approach to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">payments, gifts or hospitality between the press and the police be different to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">approach between the police and other parties.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">15. The Inquiry would be interested to receive views as to whether there should be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rules in place to govern how and when police officers and other police staff leaving</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Police Service can take up posts with the media, commercial or other bodies, with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">examples of when such a move has been problematic or brought advantages where</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">possible.</span>

</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">16. The Inquiry would be interested to receive views as to whether there should be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rules in place to govern how and when members of the press, or the media more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">generally, can take up posts with the Police Service, with examples of when such a</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">At a more specific level, Module Two covered a number of different topics. First, it involved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a consideration of Operation Caryatid from its inception, following a complaint by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Royal Household in relation to the interception of mobile phone messages, through to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the commencement and impact of Operations Weeting, Elveden and Tuleta. To that end</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a number of police officers gave evidence, along with the relevant Directors of Public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prosecutions and leading counsel instructed in the prosecution of Clive Goodman and Glenn</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire. Second, it concerned the more general relationship over many years between the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press and the MPS, thereby involving witnesses who complained about the impact of that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship upon themselves; the last four Commissioners and the present Commissioner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the MPS, together with many very senior officers and ex officers and personnel from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Department of Public Affairs; and journalists who had considered the relationship and crime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists who depended upon it. Third, evidence of comparison with other regional police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">forces and the regional press was called both from Chief Constables, other ranks and press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">departments, as was evidence of the approach of the Association of Chief Police Officers.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Fourth, reports prepared by the Chief Inspector of Constabulary (Sir Denis O&#8217;Connor) and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the Commissioner of the MPS (by Elizabeth Filkin), and the views of police authorities</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(including the relevant regulator for the MPS, the Mayor&#8217;s Office for Policing and Crime)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also fell to be considered. This evidence broadly concluded on 4 April 2012, with the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">having heard from 93 witnesses over 23 days.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As I have indicated above, the evidence of a number of witnesses covered all four modules.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That was particularly so in relation to Rupert Murdoch, James Murdoch, the proprietors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of other newspaper groups and a number of senior staff from News Corporation or News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">International. This group of seven witnesses gave evidence (over two weeks in April and May</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2012) between Module Two concerning the press and the police and Module 3 concerning</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press and politicians.</span>
<h4>Module Three</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-14"><a href="#para2-14" name="para2-14">2.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Module Three formally opened on 10 May 2012 and involved evidence over a period in excess</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of four weeks from 44 witnesses. These included some of the most senior politicians of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">last 20 years (including the present and last three Prime Ministers, the Deputy Prime Minister,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Leader of the Opposition and the First Minister of Scotland), senior civil servants, special</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advisersandpoliticaljournalists.Theprimaryconcernwastherelationshipbetweenpoliticians</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of all political hues and the press, together with the impact (whether in reality or as a matter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of perception) of such relationships as existed on the development and implementation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of policy concerning the press. Political challenges came to the fore, however, in particular</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerns about the handling by the present Government of the bid by News Corporation for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those shares in BSkyB Ltd which were not already owned or controlled by Rupert Murdoch.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although only one of a number of issues regarding the relationship between politicians and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the proprietors and editors of mass market newspapers over the last 30 years, the questions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that arose (being of contemporary political concern) came to dominate aspects of the Inquiry.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was particular interest in an issue arising from Parliamentary Questions addressed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, which were the subject</span>

</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a detailed account in his statement to the Inquiry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup> In the event, these Parliamentary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Questions were not then pursued in the House of Commons; they were examined, at some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">length, when Jeremy Hunt MP gave evidence.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup> This module continued until 14 June 2012,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although aspects were further examined on 25-26 June.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As with the first two modules, key questions regarding the relationship between the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and politicians were identified and placed on the website<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup> for consideration and comment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by any interested group or member of the public. Again, it provides useful context for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">work of the Inquiry to set these questions out at this stage:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Inquiry is now looking at the relationship between the press and politicians.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We are interested in hearing from professionals and the public with information and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">examples in response to the specific questions below. Your answers may be considered</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as potential evidence to the Inquiry and may be published in a redacted form as part</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the Inquiry&#8217;s evidence.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">1. The Inquiry is interested in the extent of public knowledge and understanding of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the relationship between the media and the politicians. Where does that knowledge</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">come from? How is it tested? What use is made of publicly available information (for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">example about meetings between senior politicians and leading media figures)? Has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the change to the Ministerial Code in July 2011 made a difference? (The Code now</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">states: &#8220;the Government will be open about its links with the media. All meetings</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with newspaper and other media proprietors, editors and senior executives will be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">published quarterly, regardless of the purpose of the meeting&#8221;.)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2. The Inquiry would like to hear views on the specific benefits and risks to the public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interest arising from relationships between senior politicians, at a national level,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the media. What does the public stand to gain from this relationship? What</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">does it stand to lose? How can the gains be maximised and the risks minimised? Are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there specific considerations the Inquiry should be aware of in the run up to general</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">elections and other national polls?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">3. The Inquiry is interested in hearings views on the conditions that are necessary for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a free press in a democracy to fulfil its role in holding politicians and the powerful to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">account. What is the nature of that role? What is the public entitled to expect of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press in fulfilling it? How can the public see for itself that the press is taking this role</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">seriously and going about it responsibly? Are there some good examples?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">4. Is there a perception that political journalism generally has moved from reporting,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to seeking to make or influence political events? How far is there evidence for that,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and should it be a matter of public concern or not? Does the press have a legitimate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">function in fulfilling a political Opposition role?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">5. The Inquiry is interested in the nature of media influence on public policy in general</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(for example in areas such as criminal justice, immigration or European policy). Do</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you have views, or any specific examples, about how that influence is exercised and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with what effect? How transparent is the process? Is the public well served by it?</span>




</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">6. The Inquiry is particularly interested in the influence of the media in the content</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and timing of a party&#8217;s media policies, and in a Government decision-making on policy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or operational issues directly affecting the media. Do you have any personal examples</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of how this works in practice? Are the media effective lobbyists in their own causes?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Do any risks arise from the Government&#8217;s role in the determination of takeovers and/</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or mergers of media organisations? Is there a need for additional safeguards or limits</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on such involvement?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">7. Is there a need for plurality of voice in news providers within the press, in providers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of other types of news media or across the media as a whole? How does access to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">news information through the internet affect the need for plurality? What level of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">plurality is required? Is plurality of ownership a sufficient proxy for plurality of voice?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">8. Isthereevidenceofmediainfluenceonpublic andpoliticalappointments(including</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the tenure and termination of those appointments)? The Inquiry is interested in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">examples, including of cases where the public interest was, and was not, well served</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by such influence.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">9. How far do you think politicians feel inhibited from acting in the public interest</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to ensure that the media&#8217;s conduct, practices and ethics are themselves in the public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interest? Why might that be? What would make a difference?&#8221;</span>
<h4>Module Four</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-16"><a href="#para2-16" name="para2-16">2.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Module Four commenced on 9 July 2012 and the Inquiry heard from 30 witnesses. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">module was initially described as involving a discussion of &#8216;emerging findings&#8217;. In the event,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was clear that the Press Board of Finance (PressBoF) and the current chair of the PCC had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">embarked upon the process of re-casting self-regulation; this Module therefore consisted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a detailed examination not only of that model but also a substantial number of other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">models for the regulation of the press that had been submitted as evidence to the Inquiry.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">To encourage that process and assist those devising potential solutions to the problems of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press regulation, the Inquiry published Draft Criteria for an Effective Regulatory Regime.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These were not intended to be definitive but merely illustrative of the issues that had to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">addressed. These criteria were as follows:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In module 4 the Inquiry will hear proposals for potential press regulatory solutions.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There are three aspects to the question of what regulatory regime should apply to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the press in the future: firstly what a regulatory regime should do; secondly how it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should be structured to achieve that; and thirdly the detailed rules that are put in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">place to achieve the objectives. The &#8216;what&#8217; is about outcomes and the &#8216;how&#8217; is about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">processes, structures and accountabilities. The detailed rules would be dealt with in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the substance of any code or regulations. These three aspects of a regulatory regime</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">need to be considered separately as they are not necessarily dependent on each other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and it may be possible to achieve the desired objectives by different combinations of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">solutions.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has already heard a number of suggestions in relation to the &#8216;how&#8217; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the purpose of module 4 is to look at those suggestions in more detail. In order to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">facilitate the scrutiny of the &#8216;how&#8217; proposals it is necessary to understand &#8216;what&#8217; any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regulatory solution is seeking to achieve. The draft criteria for a regulatory solution</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">below set out the criteria against which the Inquiry proposes to measure potential</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regulatory solutions. The Inquiry would welcome comments on these criteria.</span>


</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Draft Criteria for a Regulatory Solution</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1.<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic"> Effectiveness</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">1.1 Any solution must be perceived as effective and credible both by the press as an</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) It must strike a balance, capable of being accepted as reasonable, legitimate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and in the public interest by all.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) It must recognise the importance for the public interest of a free press in a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">democracy, freedom of expression and investigative journalism, the rule of law,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">personal privacy and other private rights, and a press which acts responsibly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and in the public interest.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) It must promote a clear understanding of &#8216;the public interest&#8217; which would be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">accepted as reasonable by press, industry and public alike.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(d) It must be durable and sufficiently flexible to work for future markets and</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2.1 There must be a statement of ethical standards which is recognised as reasonable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by the industry and credible by the public. This statement must identify enforceable</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2.2 All standards for good practice in journalism should be driven by the public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interest and must be benchmarked in a clear objective way to the public interest.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2.3 The setting of standards must be independent of government and parliament,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and sufficiently independent of media interests, in order to command public respect.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">4.1 The system must provide credible remedies, both in respect of aggrieved</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">individuals and in respect of issues affecting wider groups in society.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">4.2 The regulatory regime must have effective investigatory and advisory powers.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">4.3 The system should also actively support and promote compliance by the industry,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">both directly (for example by providing confidential pre-publication advice) and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">indirectly (for example by kitemarking titles&#8217; own internal systems).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">4.4 The system should be a good fit with other relevant regulatory and law</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enforcement functions.</span>

<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-size: 16px;">5.<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic"> Cost</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">5.1 The solution must be sufficiently reliably financed to allow for reasonable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">operational independence and appropriate scope, but without placing a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">disproportionate burden on either the industry, complainants or the taxpayer.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-17"><a href="#para2-17" name="para2-17">2.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Quite apart from the regulatory solution, Module Four also dealt with other key questions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, to that end, involved evidence from experts in diverse fields ranging from differing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approaches to press regulation across the word (and, in particular, the Irish model) to data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protection, from ethics and philosophy to plurality. The key questions, reflecting some of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these issues, were published on the website<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup> and, again, interested parties and the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were invited to submit evidence which could be considered during the course of the evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(even if only to prompt questions from Counsel to the Inquiry). These questions were as</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">follows:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold"> Relevant</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> aspects</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> of</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> the</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> public</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> interest</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">1. How would you describe the public interest in a free press?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2. How would you describe the public interest in freedom of expression? To what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">extent does that public interest coincide with, or diverge from, the public interest in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a free press?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">3. In order to maximise the overall public interest, with what other aspects of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public interest would freedom of expression, or freedom of the press, have to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">balanced or limited? The Inquiry is particularly interested in the following, but there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">may be others:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) the interest of the public as a whole in good political governance, for example</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in areas such as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; national security, public order and economic wellbeing,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; the rule of law, the proper independence and accountability of law</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enforcement agencies, and access to justice, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; the democratic accountability of government for the formation and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">implementation of policy;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) the public interest in individual self-determination and the protection and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enforcement of private interests, for example</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; privacy, including (but not necessarily limited to) the rights to privacy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">specified in general in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Rights and in European and national legislation on the protection of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">personal data,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; confidentiality, the protection of reputation, and intellectual and other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">property rights, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; individual freedom of expression and rights to receive and impart</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information where those interests and rights are not identical to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interests and rights of the press.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">4. What are your views on the extent to which the overall public interest is currently</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">well served, both in principle and in practice, by the current balance between the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public interest in the freedom of the press and free expression on the one hand,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and competing aspects of the public interest on the other? In your opinion, what</span>


</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">changes if any would be desirable in this respect, in order to maximise the overall</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public interest? If relevant, please state whether those changes should be voluntary</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or obligatory.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">Press ethics</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">5. What would be the distinguishing features of the conduct and practices of a media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">industry, or any organisation which was a part of that industry, which would make it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">an &#8216;ethical&#8217; one?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">6. In particular, to whom might the press be considered to owe ethical duties, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">why? What might be the content of such duties? To what extent might such duties</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">come into conflict, and how should any such conflicts be resolved? The Inquiry is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">particularly interested in the following as potentially owed ethical duties, but there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">may be others:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) readers and consumers of the media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) persons who are the subject matter of stories and other media products</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) the wider public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(d) employees, journalists and other producers of the media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(e) shareholders, investors, advertisers and others with an economic interest in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the media.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">7. What role might reasonably be expected to be played by a code of conduct in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">encouraging, inculcating or enforcing ethical behaviour by the press? What would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be the distinguishing principles and features of any code of ethical conduct with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">universal application to the media industry?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">8. To what extent does the media industry&#8217;s Code of Practice (http://www.pcc.org.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">uk/cop/practice.html) meet the needs of an ethical code?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">9. What approach would you recommend to the consideration of improvement to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the nature, status, content and enforceability of the current Code? Are there changes</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to either content or enforceability of the current Code you would wish to see? Please</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">explain your thinking.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">10. What other changes would you consider desirable in order to encourage or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">constrain the press to improved standards of ethical conduct and practice? Your</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">answer should explain the standards you consider appropriate and why, whether</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">conformity should be encouraged or constrained, and how.&#8221;</span>

<h2>3. Challenging the evidence</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Litigation in this country is generally conducted by way of adversarial process. In other words,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subject to the over-riding control of the court, the parties to the litigation define the issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the evidence to be adduced, each side disclosing the evidence on which it is intended to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rely and calling such witnesses as it feels necessary to prove its case. Witnesses called by one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">side are cross-examined by the other side or sides, challenging evidence which is disputed and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;putting&#8217; the case which is to be advanced so that the witness can deal with the allegations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made against him or her. The role of the judge or tribunal is to stand in the middle of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exercise, intervening in the evidence to elucidate or seek explanation and then listen to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opposing arguments of the parties both as to the facts and the law, before ultimately deciding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the issues at stake. Inquisitorial proceedings (more common in civil law than common law</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">jurisdictions) are led by the judge or tribunal and involve active participation the investigation</span>

</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the facts. There will still be an important role for the legal representatives of the parties to</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">ensure that their &#8216;case&#8217; is fully considered.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The purpose of an Inquiry is not to resolve issues between parties to litigation; there are no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parties and there is no litigation in place. On more than one occasion, it has appeared that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at least one Core Participant has treated itself as if in adversarial litigation with the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but that is to misunderstand both the Inquiry and the role of those who participate in it.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The role of the Core Participants has been to assist the Inquiry in the elucidation of the facts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which form the substratum of the Terms of Reference and then to make submissions on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way forward. The point was made in specific connection to this Inquiry by Lord Justice Moses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the first of the challenges by Elaine Decoulos to my failure to grant her Core Participant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">status. He said [2011] EWHC 3214 (Admin) at para 5:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The purpose of the Inquiry is not to vindicate individuals&#8217; sufferings or claims</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they may have due to mistreatment by the press, but rather for all of us as citizens</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">concerned at the relations between the press, institutions and the public.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The role of Core Participants is, therefore, totally different to that of the parties to litigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and very much more constrained than the role that might be adopted even in inquisitorial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proceedings which are directed to dealing with individual complaints or claims. Furthermore,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the part that is or can be taken by Core Participants (or anyone else) is defined by statute and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does not fall within the general discretion of the Inquiry. Thus, Rule 10 of the Inquiry Rules</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2006 is in these terms:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) to (5), where a witness is giving oral evidence at an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">inquiry hearing, only counsel to the inquiry ... and the inquiry panel may ask</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the witness questions.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(2) Whereawitness,whetheracoreparticipantorotherwise,hasbeenquestioned</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">orally in the course of an inquiry hearing pursuant to paragraph (1), the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">chairman may direct that the recognised legal representative of that witness</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">may ask the witness questions.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(3) Where &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) witness other than a core participant has been questioned orally in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">course of an inquiry hearing by counsel to the inquiry, or by the inquiry</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">panel; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) that witness&#8217;s evidence directly relates to the evidence of another witness,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the recognised legal representative of the witness to whom the evidence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relates may apply to the chairman for permission to question the witness</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who has given oral evidence.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(4) The recognised legal representative of a core participant may apply to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">chairman for permission to ask questions of a witness giving oral evidence.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(5) When making an application under paragraphs (3) or (4), the recognised legal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">representative must state &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) the issues in respect of which a witness is to be questioned; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) whether the questioning will raise new issues or, if not, why the questioning</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should be permitted.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As early as 6 September 2011, I raised this provision and the potential consequences of it,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">observing that given the pressure on the Inquiry, subject to submissions, I &#8220;may well&#8221; require</span>

</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues which Core Participants wished to raise to be discussed with Counsel to the Inquiry in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the first instance; he would then be able to conduct such cross-examination as he believed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate and, at the same time, restrict other cross-examination.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup> That was, in fact, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way in which the Inquiry proceeded but it did so in an even-handed way. By way of example,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although Core Participants for affected newspapers suggested questions and lines of enquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to those who complained that they had been the victims of illegal or unethical press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attention (and many of these were pursued by Counsel to the Inquiry when the witnesses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gave evidence), I did not permit these witnesses to be cross examined in a manner that could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been appropriate in civil proceedings: I was not prepared to allow them potentially to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be victimised again simply because they wished to complain about what had happened to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them. Similarly, not only did I prevent cross examination by Core Participants of journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and others in relation to the subject matter of criminal investigation; subject to specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exceptions and the requirements of fairness enshrined in s17(3) of the Inquiries Act 2005,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">neither did I generally permit it in relation to other allegations of illegal or unethical conduct.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That is not to say that the evidence has not been probed: that is the role that Counsel to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry has undertaken with rigour but always with an eye to the Terms of Reference in general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and addressing the culture, practices and ethics of the press in particular. Notwithstanding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the general approach, however, some aspects of the evidence have been subject to detailed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examination.</span>
<h4>Findings of fact</h4>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although the constraints relating to the examination of witnesses are written into the statute</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and thus have bound me, I would not want it to be thought that I considered them to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inappropriate or inimical to the interests of justice in this particular Inquiry. Quite the reverse.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Had the procedure been otherwise, this Inquiry need never have finished. In relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press and the public, the Inquiry has not only looked at the historical position but has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">traversed over 20 years of journalistic activity. Hundreds of complaints have been made and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although there is no issue about many, a lot more have been the subject of challenge (to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">greater or lesser effect) and could have given rise to detailed factual investigation. Those few</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories that have been investigated in depth inevitably took a great deal of time: had it been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary for each one, the time taken would have been inordinate.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further, the Inquiry covered far more than the press and the public. The relationship between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press and the police covered the tenure of no fewer than five Commissioners of Police for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Metropolis and crossed all national titles. Other forces, their press offices and local papers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were also the subject of evidence. As for the relationship between press and politicians, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the same way that time was devoted to the bid by News Corp for the remaining shares in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">BSkyB Ltd, so many dominating political stories (from Iraq to the Euro) have been subject to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rigorous and detailed analysis. Many have argued that this the Inquiry should have proceeded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in this way on the basis that all were or may have been affected or influenced by the way in</span>



</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-size: 15px;">which they were reported. The same is said for the development of press handling by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government over the last 20 years. The effect, however, would have been an Inquiry that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would have taken many years, by the end of which time the specific concerns which brought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the Inquiry in the first place (and, in particular, the issue of the regulation of the press)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would have remained unaddressed, other than in whatever way the press chose themselves</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to address them in the meantime. That was not the brief that was contained within Part 1 of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Terms of Reference and it is not how I have sought to address them.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This means that a large number of specific individual incidents have not been the subject of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very detailed factual investigation so that, subject to very limited exceptions, I do not feel in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a position to make findings of fact as to what did and did not occur; neither, for the purposes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of addressing the Terms of Reference is it necessary that I do so. One example, the subject of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considerable press comment, will suffice.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prior to autumn 2009, The Sun had supported the Labour Party in the three preceding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">General Elections. During the Labour Party conference, it decided to make public a change in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allegiance and thereafter to support the Conservative Party. For present purposes, although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant to the issue of the impact of proprietors on editorial policy, the circumstances of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that decision do not matter. When giving evidence, Rupert Murdoch said that after this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision had been publicised in September 2009, he received a telephone call from the Prime</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the Downing Street switchboard (through which he says any such telephone call would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been routed) backing up this denial.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-10"><a href="#para3-10" name="para3-10">3.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It has been suggested that it is important that I resolve this conflict of evidence and express</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">my view as to where the truth lies. I decline to do so for two very different reasons. The first</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is very important in the context of the nature of the Inquiry and the manner in which it has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had to be approached both as a matter of statute but also, as I have indicated, practicality.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is possible to postulate circumstances in which the question of whether this telephone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">call took place was central to the resolution of civil litigation between the parties. In that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">event, considerable investigation would have focussed around the precise date and time of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the alleged telephone call; questions would have been addressed to Mr Murdoch as to how</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he said that the call had been connected; phone records and other documents sought on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discovery. Mr Murdoch would have been cross-examined at length by counsel for Mr Brown</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and vice versa. The question who to believe would have been capable of decision within a far</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fuller factual matrix. To do so, in particular, without permitting cross-examination seems to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">me to be unfair to both men.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-11"><a href="#para3-11" name="para3-11">3.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I recognise that judges are sometimes required to make difficult factual decisions with very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">little more than the information available and, if it was critical to do so, I would have had to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">do the best that I could. That leads me to the second reason. In short, it is neither critical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nor, indeed, necessary to decide where the truth of this conversation lies: save in the limited</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">respect of the credibility of Mr Murdoch, it is not relevant to the Terms of Reference at all.</span>



</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-size: 15px;">On any showing, Mr Brown would hardly have been pleased about the loss of the support for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his Government of The Sun;whether and if so how he chose to communicate his view simply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">takes the Inquiry no further.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-12"><a href="#para3-12" name="para3-12">3.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In part, I have gone into the detail of this particular factual conflict because of the interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and concern that has been expressed about it. Of greater importance as a reason for doing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so has been to explain the limitations of the forensic exercise that it has been possible to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undertake while addressing the very wide Terms of Reference within the broad timeframe</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within which I have been asked to report. This Report will not provide all the answers to all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the questions that could possibly arise out of the uncountable number of issues that have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been raised in evidence. Those who are expecting it to do so will be disappointed.</span>

<a name="section4"></a>
<h2>4. Other material</h2>

<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The material which can fall to be used by the Inquiry is not, however, limited to the statements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that have been put into evidence. It has fallen to me to determine what should be part of that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">record; I have deliberately adopted as wide a definition of relevance as possible, in order to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ensure that as full a picture of the culture, practices and ethics of the press can be put into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public domain by the Inquiry. In that way, the public can itself make a collective decision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">based on the same material that has been available to me. Thus, both in advance of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry and while it has been proceeding, different press titles have throughout presented</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the evidence and the issues (or their perception of each) and commented on the approach,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">asserting facts and reaching their own conclusions both as to what I have been doing and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what I have been thinking. Some titles, conversely, have offered minimal, if any, coverage of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry for their readers. Free speech requires no less and although I have occasionally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">raised concerns about factual accuracy,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup> I stand fully behind the freedom of the press to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">comment critically about me, my approach, the evidence and any other aspect of the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it sees fit to write about.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Very quickly, however, it became apparent that the way in which the Inquiry was being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reported told its own story about the culture and practices of the press. In the circumstances,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in addition to the other evidence that has been read into the record of the Inquiry, I also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decided that the product of a press cuttings service dealing with the Inquiry should also be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">read into the record. At several stages during the course of the hearings, I have made this fact</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">clear.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has not been alone in commenting on the way in which the press have reported</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry. Private Eye has regularly published commentary on the way in which it has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reported; the campaign (on the website http://hackinginquiry.org/) has done the same.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Bloggers have added their own comment and the Inquiry has engaged with Twitter (http://</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">twitter.com/@levesoninquiry) on which there has been a regular and substantial dialogue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the Inquiry both in this country and abroad. This also is a very powerful example of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proper manifestation of free speech.</span>

<h2>5. Submissions</h2>

<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition to leading Counsel to the Inquiry, all those who were Core Participants for Module</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One made formal opening submissions at its commencement.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup> There were submissions at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the start of Module Two from Mr Jay, and also on behalf of the Commissioner of Police for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Metropolis and the Metropolitan Police Authority (now the Mayor&#8217;s Office for Policing and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Crime).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup> Module Three was opened only by Mr Jay.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the same way, Counsel to the Inquiry and the Core Participants have assisted me with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argument in relation to the rulings to which I have referred above and other issues that have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arisen during the course of the hearings. On more than one occasion, it was necessary to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deal with disclosure of information that had been shared with Core Participants in advance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of its publication: these were highly relevant during the course of the hearings but are now</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unnecessary further to rehearse.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup> Submissions have also been received dealing with issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of evidence, on the approach to Rule 13 of the Inquiry Rules 2006 and in relation to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standard of proof, the last two of which I deal with below. Submissions have generally in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">writing and supplemented orally; all are also published on the website so that it is possible to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">see the entirety of the argument put before me as well as the ruling that followed.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-3"><a href="#para5-3" name="para5-3">5.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Final submissions on various aspects of the Inquiry have also been received following the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusion of the various modules. In the main, they have been extremely thorough, very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">detailed and, as a consequence, extremely lengthy. They have clearly been the product of an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enormous amount of work and I am grateful for the effort and very great care that has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">put into them. The fact that some arguments and submissions have not been specifically</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">addressed in this Report is not intended as a discourtesy either to the writers or to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arguments. Inevitably, this Report has had to focus on the Terms of Reference, whereas the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant Core Participants have understandably cast their nets rather wider in order to deal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both with the generality and the specifics of some of the issues that have been raised to such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extent as they affect them.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-4"><a href="#para5-4" name="para5-4">5.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although it was always anticipated that it could be necessary to re-convene the Inquiry, to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obtain updated information in relation to the police investigations and to receive any other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important evidence that had emerged following the conclusion of the hearings in July 2012,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">written and oral closing submissions were invited and presented by most (but not all) of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Core Participants. To such extent as they address the future, they shall be analysed during the</span>





</span>
<span class="newpage">

<span style="font-size: 15px;">course of the consideration of the regulatory regime, although I shall be doing so from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perspective of &#8216;the press&#8217; as opposed to the extent to which individual titles have behaved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in such a way as requires a different approach to regulation. I saw no value in Counsel to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry making a closing submission and he did not do so.</span>

<a name="section6"></a>
<h2>6. Engagement with the public: the website</h2>

<p id="para-id-6-1"><a href="#para6-1" name="para6-1">6.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Before turning to the issues of law that have had to be considered as part of the Report</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">writing process, I return to the website because it is appropriate to say something more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the way in which the Inquiry has sought to involve the public in its process and ensure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the evidence which has been given has received the widest audience.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-2"><a href="#para6-2" name="para6-2">6.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have referred to the questions that were posted on the Inquiry website as each module</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">came to be discussed in the evidence. The purpose was to engage with as wide a reach of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">members of the public as possible and to obtain as wide a range of views as possible. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extent of that response can be judged from Appendix B which sets out a detailed record of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the type and number of communications received by the Inquiry through the general mailbox</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or otherwise. Where it was possible to do so, every communication (a number of which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were anonymous) was acknowledged and considered so that a decision could be taken as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to whether it was right to take what was said forward in any way. Although I recognise that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a number of those who wrote will have been disappointed that they were not given the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opportunity to give oral evidence, I explicitly recognise and pay tribute to the very hard work</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that has been put into ensuring that all the observations have been received have been acted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">upon appropriately.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-3"><a href="#para6-3" name="para6-3">6.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Appendix B also identifies the number of times up to the end of October 2012 that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry website has been accessed along with its reach. I believe that the Inquiry has done as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">much as could reasonably have been expected to engage with the public would be surprised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if any public inquiry has achieved as much public access. I have no doubt that this has all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contributed to the public reaction to events and the further debate as to the way forward.</span>
