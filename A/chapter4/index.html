<h1>CHAPTER 4<br/>THE REPORT</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Scope</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">TheInquiryisUK-wideinits scope.Itwassetup,anditsTermsofReferencewerefinalised,with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the support of the Devolved Governments of the UK in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In so far as my recommendations address matters within areas of devolved competence, it will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of course be for the devolved administrations and legislatures to consider them in the usual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way. I have not, however, sought to any extent at all in this Report to analyse the position</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">separately from the perspective of the devolved jurisdictions, nor to acknowledge, where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">legal matters are considered, the points on which different law applies in different parts of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the UK. My timetable did not allow for that; it would have been a very complex and time-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consuming exercise. I recognise in the result that my Report may be less helpful to those with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision-making responsibilities in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, but I have sought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to set out my analysis and conclusions in a sufficiently explicit and reasoned way to enable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the experts within the devolved jurisdictions to see as readily as possible how they could be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made to fit. I have not been made aware of any technical reason why my recommendations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should not be able to be accommodated, with appropriate adjustment, in all parts of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">UK, but I have not sought detailed advice on the matter. I intend no discourtesy at all by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this approach and hope that those with the relevant decision-making responsibilities will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understand the reasons.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. Purpose</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This Report fulfils three quite separate functions. First, it is an account of the Inquiry. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">purpose of the Inquiry was to inquire into the culture practices and ethics of the press and to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">make recommendations. By conducting the Inquiry in public and in such a way that it can be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">followed by anyone with an interest to do so, the story has emerged but it is important that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is collected together in one place and I have attempted to do that as a balanced account</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of what has transpired. Further, that balance can be checked. Anyone is able to go onto the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry website, watch the play-back of the evidence, read every statement of witnesses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether called or simply introduced into the record, examine every relevant document in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the form made part of that record whether specifically referred to not and consider every</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">submission from a Core Participant or Counsel to the Inquiry and so form his or her own</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusion about the balance of the Report.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Collecting the material and presenting it in an ordered form has generated an additional</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue. It will quickly be obvious that some stories appear in more than one place in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">narrative and some not at all. That is not because different examples of types of conduct are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not available from either the material called at the Inquiry or read into the record; neither</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is it because of my over-reliance on a particular witness and the story that he or she had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to recount. It is important to appreciate, however, that in some instances, manifestations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of different criticisms come together in the same story, aggravating the wrong committed.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is equally valuable, however, to understand the same story from the perspective of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">victim, simply trying to deal with life events as they occur (with the press providing its own,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sometimes monumental, challenges) or, in some cases, over a lengthy period of time, again</span>
<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">and again having to confront different attacks from the same or different quarters. To tell</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">every story was simply impractical but to say (as is frequently asserted) that the Inquiry has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been &#8216;hijacked&#8217; by celebrities is both wrong and unfair; the claim may be thought to be an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attempt to divert attention away from the real harm caused to real people.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second purpose of the Report is to set out my conclusions on the culture, practices and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethics of the press and the other areas of my Terms of Reference. It is also to identify and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explain my recommendations as to the way forward: that, after all, is precisely what the Terms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Reference require me to do. Both conclusions and recommendations appear throughout</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Report but are, I hope, reasoned and comprehensible.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The third purpose of the Report is, in my view, the most important. It is to allow those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who read it to reach their own conclusions about every aspect of the Terms of Reference.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">From the outset (and consistently the subject of commentary throughout the hearings and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subsequently), it has been suggested that a judge is wholly unsuited to the task of seeking to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discern, let alone determine, how a free press should operate and how it should exercise its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rights of free speech. It has been said that I have had an agenda and that the failure to involve</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a journalist with tabloid or mid-market experience as an assessor demonstrates a failure to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understand the popular culture of journalism and an attempt to impose a broadsheet agenda</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when the profitable newspapers are the former not the latter. It is argued that the Terms of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Reference are either too broad or too narrow. It is open to all to reach their own conclusions.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have no doubt that all sections of the press will report and comment upon this Report, each</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper or title from its own perspective. It will be for anyone who reads the Report to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decide the extent to which any comment upon it is fair in the same way that it will be for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government (maintaining, I hope, the cross party consensus with which this Inquiry was set</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">up) to decide how far it wishes to take the recommendations that I have made. That is where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ultimate decision making properly lies.</span>

<a name="section3"></a>
<h2>3. Timing and content</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is also necessary to say something about the timetable. Although the Prime Minister initially</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hoped that the Report would be available within 12 months, two developments affected the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prospect of such a time frame being met. The first was the extension, beyond that initially</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">envisaged, of the Terms of Reference. More significant, however, was the appreciation that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was no body of evidence immediately available to provide the basis from which to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commence the calling of witnesses; the police investigation was ongoing and therefore it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not appropriate to seek to use the evidence that had been collected during that inquiry. Thus,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was only possible to start the collection of evidence in August 2011 and, given the holiday</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">period, it was inevitable that it would take some time to be prepared; only after it had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prepared and served could it be assimilated and the hearings commenced.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the event, the oral hearings commenced on 14 November 2011 and, had it been essential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to deliver a Report by the end of July 2012, they would have had to have been concluded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by April. Given the remit involving the press, the public, the police and politicians, this was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">simply not feasible. I therefore set different targets namely that the evidence should conclude</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within about 12 months of the appointment of the Inquiry and the Report should be available</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within about 12 months of the commencement of the evidence. I did so because I recognised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the fundamental importance of early delivery of a Report so that decisions could be made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and implemented as to the future within a reasonable timetable, rather than being pushed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">back thereby falling in the run up to a general election.</span>
<!--new page--><p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Meetingthetimetablehasnotbeenwithoutconsequences.Inrelationtotheevidence,careful</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">selection was made of those witnesses who would be called to give evidence on oath and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">representations were invited from Core Participants in relation to other potential witnesses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whose statements, in the absence of objection, could be read into the record without their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal attendance. Understanding the approach of the Inquiry to the evidence generally,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sensible decisions were made by the Core Participants whose assistance, throughout, has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been of very great value. The consequence, as I have explained, is that a vast body of evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not in fact the subject of oral exposition and the timetable for the hearings was met.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are, however, no different classes of evidence: although some of the material provided</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in writing is not referred to, it has all been considered.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As for the Report, the consequences are different. In an ideal world, I would have wished to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">write, re-write and hone this Report so that every nuance could be the subject of mature</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reflection. As previous inquiries have shown, given the amount of evidence whether oral,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">documentary or read-in, that would have been a task of very many months duration. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Report, therefore, is the work of many hands,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> all working to my direction and reflecting my</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">views; that is the inevitable consequence of the way in which the work has had to be done.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I place on record my appreciation to all those who have collated the evidence in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different aspects of the Report. Having said that, I repeat that every finding of fact, every</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusion and every recommendation expressed in this Report is mine alone. Equally, any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">errors are my responsibility.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref1" name="footnote1" title="Go back to footnote reference 1 in the text">1</a>.  That is to say, I have been assisted in the drafting by Counsel and by civil servant members of the Inquiry team; theAssessors have been invited to provide comments on drafts only where appropriate.</p><!--footnote-->
