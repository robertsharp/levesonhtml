<h1>CHAPTER 1<br/>THE ANNOUNCEMENT</h1>


<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On, 13 July 2011, the Prime Minister made a statement to the House of Commons in these</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In recent days, the whole country has been shocked by the revelations of the phone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hacking scandal. What this country&#8212;and the House&#8212;has to confront is an episode</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that is, frankly, disgraceful: accusations of widespread lawbreaking by parts of our</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press: alleged corruption by some police officers; and, as we have just discussed, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">failure of our political system over many, many years to tackle a problem that has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been getting worse. We must at all times keep the real victims at the front and centre</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of this debate. Relatives of those who died at the hands of terrorism, war heroes</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and murder victims&#8212;people who have already suffered in a way that we can barely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">imagine&#8212;have been made to suffer all over again.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I believe that we all want the same thing: press, police and politicians who serve the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public. Last night the Deputy Prime Minister and I met the Leader of the Opposition.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I also met the Chairs of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, the Home Affairs</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Committee and the Justice Committee to discuss the best way forward. Following</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">these consultations, I want to set out today how we intend to proceed: first, on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public inquiry; secondly, on the issues surrounding News International&#8217;s proposed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">takeover of BSkyB; and thirdly, on ethics in the police service and its relationship with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the press.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Before I do that, I will update the House on the current criminal investigation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">into phone hacking. I met Sir Paul Stephenson last night. He assured me that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation is fully resourced. It is one of the largest currently under way in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">country, and is being carried out by a completely different team from the one that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">carried out the original investigation. It is being led by Deputy Assistant Commissioner</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Sue Akers, who I believe impressed the Home Affairs Committee yesterday. Her team</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is looking through 11,000 pages containing 3,870 names, and around 4,000 mobile</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and 5,000 landline phone numbers. The team has contacted 170 people so far, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">will contact every single person named in those documents. The commissioner&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">office informed me this morning that the team has so far made eight arrests and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">undertaken numerous interviews.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Let me now turn to the action that the Government are taking. Last week in the House</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I set out our intention to establish an independent public inquiry into phone hacking</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and other illegal practices in the British press. We have looked carefully at what the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nature of the inquiry should be. We want it to be one that is as robust as possible&#8212;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">one that can get to the truth fastest and also get to work the quickest, and, vitally, one</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that commands the full confidence of the public. Clearly there are two pieces of work</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that have to be done. First, we need a full investigation into wrongdoing in the press</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the police, including the failure of the first police investigation. Secondly, we need</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a review of regulation of the press. We would like to get on with both those elements</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as quickly as possible, while being mindful of the ongoing criminal investigations. So,</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">after listening carefully, we have decided that the best way to proceed is with one</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">inquiry, but in two parts.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I can tell the House that the inquiry will be led by one of the most senior judges in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the country, Lord Justice Leveson. He will report to both the Home Secretary and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. The inquiry will be established</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">under the Inquiries Act 2005, which means that it will have the power to summon</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">witnesses, including newspaper reporters, management, proprietors, policemen and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">politicians of all parties, to give evidence under oath and in public. &#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Starting as soon as possible, Lord Justice Leveson, assisted by a panel of senior</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">independent figures with relevant expertise in media, broadcasting, regulation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and government will inquire into the culture, practices and ethics of the press; its</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relationship with the police; the failure of the current system of regulation; the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contacts made, and discussions had, between national newspapers and politicians;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">why previous warnings about press misconduct were not heeded; and the issue of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cross-media ownership. He will make recommendations for a new, more effective way</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of regulating the press&#8212;one that supports its freedom, plurality and independence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from Government, but which also demands the highest ethical and professional</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">standards. He will also make recommendations about the future conduct of relations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">between politicians and the press. That part of the inquiry we hope will report within</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">12 months.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The second part of the inquiry will examine the extent of unlawful or improper conduct</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at the News of the World and other newspapers, and the way in which management</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">failures may have allowed it to happen. That part of the inquiry will also look into</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the original police investigation and the issue of corrupt payments to police officers,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and will consider the implications for the relationships between newspapers and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">police. Lord Justice Leveson has agreed to these draft terms of reference. I am placing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">them in the Library today, and we will send them to the devolved Administrations. No</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">one should be in any doubt of our intention to get to the bottom of the truth and learn</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the lessons for the future.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Terms of Reference were then the subject of further discussion both with the devolved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and other interested parties. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prime Minister returned to the topic on 20 July 2011, when announcing the appointment of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Assessors. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We have made some significant amendments to the remit of the inquiry. With</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">allegations that the problem of the relationship between the press and the police</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">goes wider than just the Met, we have agreed that other relevant forces will now be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">within the scope of the inquiry. We have agreed that the inquiry should consider not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">just the relationship between the press, police and politicians, but their individual</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">conduct too. We have also made it clear that the inquiry should look not just at the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press, but at other media organisations, including broadcasters and social media if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there is any evidence that they have been involved in criminal activities.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thus, the Terms of Reference of the Inquiry, as finally drafted, are:</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 16px;">part 1</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">1. To inquire into the culture, practices, and ethics of the press, including:</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) contacts and the relationships between national newspapers and politicians,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the conduct of each;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) contacts and the relationship between the press and the police, and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">conduct of each;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) the extent to which the current policy and regulatory framework has failed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">including in relation to data protection; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(d) the extent to which there was a failure to act on previous warnings about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">media misconduct.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2. To make recommendations:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) for a new more effective policy and regulatory regime which supports</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the integrity and freedom of the press, the plurality of the media, and its</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">independence, including from Government, while encouraging the highest</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ethical and professional standards;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) for how future concerns about press behaviour, media policy, regulation and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cross-media ownership should be dealt with by all the relevant authorities,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">including Parliament, Government, the prosecuting authorities and the police;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) the future conduct of relations between politicians and the press; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(d) the future conduct of relations between the police and the press.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 16px;">part 2</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">3. ToinquireintotheextentofunlawfulorimproperconductwithinNewsInternational,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other newspaper organisations and, as appropriate, other organisations within the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">media, and by those responsible for holding personal data.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">4. Toinquireintothewayinwhichanyrelevantpoliceforceinvestigatedallegationsor</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">evidence of unlawful conduct by persons within or connected with News International,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the review by the Metropolitan Police of their initial investigation, and the conduct of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the prosecuting authorities.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">5. To inquire into the extent to which the police received corrupt payments or other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">inducements, or were otherwise complicit in such misconduct or in suppressing its</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proper investigation, and how this was allowed to happen.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">6. To inquire into the extent of corporate governance and management failures</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at News International and other newspaper organisations, and the role, if any,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of politicians, public servants and others in relation to any failure to investigate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wrongdoing at News International</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">7. In the light of these inquiries, to consider the implications for the relationships</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">between newspaper organisations and the police, prosecuting authorities, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relevant regulatory bodies &#8211; and to recommend what actions, if any, should be taken.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By letter dated 28 July 2011,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> as responsible Ministers under the Inquiries Act 2005, the Rt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Hon Jeremy Hunt MP (then the Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sports) and Baroness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Browning (then a Minister of State at the Home Office) appointed me to Chair the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pursuant to s3(1)(a) of the Act. On the same date, their appointment having previously been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">announced by the Prime Minister, acting pursuant to s11(2)(a) of the Act, the Ministers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appointed six Assessors with a wide range of professional experience to assist the Inquiry.</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">These were Sir David Bell,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> Shami Chakrabarti CBE,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> Lord (David) Currie,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> Elinor Goodman,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">George Jones<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> and Sir Paul Scott-Lee.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">From the day of the announcement of my appointment, it was necessary to identify</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate support. A Director General with a legal background and experience at the Home</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Office, the Ministry of Justice and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Rowena Collins</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rice was an ideal appointment as Secretary to the Inquiry. Kim Brudenell, a senior solicitor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the Treasury Solicitor&#8217;s office was appointed Solicitor to the Inquiry; Amanda Jeffery</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(from the Judicial Office) and Rachel Clark (from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and previously the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills) were appointed as Heads</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Administration and Research respectively. With an eye on prudent financial management,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suitable civil servants from across Government were recruited to staff the Inquiry and ensure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it could proceed expeditiously and efficiently.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I also set about appointing counsel. With the assistance of the Treasury Solicitor, I selected</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Robert Jay QC to be Counsel to the Inquiry; with my approval he nominated David Barr and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Carine Patry Hoskins as junior Counsel, later adding Lucinda Boon for Module 2 (concerning</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the relationship between the press and the police). Counsel were assisted by junior members</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Bar in relation to the necessary research for both preparing the examination of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">witnesses and the subsequent collation of the evidence.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At the very beginning of this Report, it is appropriate to record my enormous gratitude to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Assessors, to Counsel and to the entire Inquiry team (whose names are set out in Appendix A</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to this Report) for their unstinting commitment to the Inquiry and the prodigious effort that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been put into ensuring that it proceeded smoothly, to budget and, most important, was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">able appropriately to address the Terms of Reference within a time frame that aIlows early</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consideration to be given by the Government and Parliament to the way forward.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>

<h2>2. Role of the assessors</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">From the outset, challenges were mounted by a number of press interests to the way in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which the Inquiry was set up and, in particular, to the experience, role and responsibility of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Assessors. Having obtained cross party support for their appointment, when identifying</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them by name,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> the Prime Minister said of them<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;these</span><span style="font-style:italic"> people</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> been</span><span style="font-style:italic"> chosen</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> only</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for their expertise in the media,<span style="font-size: 14px;"> broadcasting</span> ,<span style="font-size: 14px;"> regulation</span> and policing, but for their complete</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">independence from the interested parties.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">AttheopeningsessionoftheInquiry,IspokeoftheAssessorshaving&#8220;acentralroleinthework&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so that the report would be a &#8220;collaborative effort&#8221; and that if a particular recommendation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not unanimous, &#8220;I sh<span style="font-size: 15px;"> all</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> make</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> the</span> c<span style="font-size: 15px;"> ontrary</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> vi</span> ew clear.&#8221; It was argued that this would make</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Assessors into members of the panel pursuant to s4 of the Inquiries Act 2005 and that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they lacked balance on the basis that their number included nobody with tabloid or mid-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">market newspaper experience.</span>







<!--new page--><p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In a ruling of 17 October 2011,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup> I rejected the view that the Assessors were a hybrid between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assessorswithin themeaningofs11of theInquiries Act2005and members of thedetermining</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">panel (as set out in s4). I set out the role for assessors in para 3 of the Assessor Protocol in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;An assessor will take such part in the proceedings of the Inquiry as the Chairman</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">may request, and in particular the Chairman may at any time request an assessor to:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">(a) Attend the whole or part of any<span style="font-size: 15px;"> hearing</span> , seminar or briefing; and/or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) Chair the whole or part of any seminar in an area of his or her expertise; and/</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) Prepare a report for the Chairman on any matter relevant to the Inquiry within</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the area of expertise of the assessor; and/or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(d) Provide to Counsel to the Inquiry suggested lines of questioning for witnesses,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in respect of any matters within his or her expertise; and/or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(e) Provide the Chairman with any other assistance, or advice, on any matter</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relevant to the Inquiry within the expertise of the assessor.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the event that an Assessor prepared a report that I intended to take into account, paragraph</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">4 of the Protocol made it clear that it should be disclosed to the Core Participants (who could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">submit observations upon it) and thereafter published as part of the evidence. In the event,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have not asked any Assessor to prepare a report that I intend to take into account; there is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no question of any providing me with &#8216;evidence&#8217; or other material which it is appropriate to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">share with Core Participants in order that they may make submissions about it. The extent to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which the Assessors would take part in or impact upon my conclusions was also explained in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">my ruling which includes a description of their role and responsibilities in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;30. The assessors also bring an understanding of the practical implications of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">potential ways forward &#8211; what may, or may not, work in the fields of their respective</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expertise. It is that to which I refer when I speak of being collaborative and &#8216;striving</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for unanimity&#8217;.<span style="font-size: 14px;"> There</span> is absolutely no point in my suggesting a way forward (if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">different from the present system) that everyone decries as unworkable; if that were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my provisional view, I would want to be told. The process I envisage would entail,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">amongst other things, seeking the assistance and advice of my assessors but, as I have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">also explained, I may also test out possible solutions in further seminars. Again, with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fairness as my touchstone, if I believe that new material is generated, that material</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">will be shared so that all can make submissions upon it.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">31 Ultimately, however, as I have made very clear, my conclusions shall be solely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my conclusions. There is no question of publishing concurring views. In the spirit of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">openness and transparency, however, I shall identify the fact that one or more of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the assessors disagrees with my conclusions and I shall explain the nature of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">disagreement: in that way, those who read my report will be able to make up their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">own minds.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Assessors have been scrupulous to follow the approach set out in the Protocol and ruling.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">They have assisted in relation to avenues of investigation and lines of enquiry both generally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and to specific witnesses. Although there has been repeated criticism of the Inquiry for not</span>



<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">engaging an assessor with experience of tabloid or mid-market newspapers (along with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggestions that nobody working in a broadsheet newspaper would be able to understand</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the dynamics of tabloid or mid-market journalism), nobody has suggested in evidence that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the approach to ethical issues should be different. In any event, far from ignoring the different</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interests to which tabloid and mid-market newspapers appeal, the Assessors with experience</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of journalism have been assiduous to keep me aware, both in advance and as I was hearing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the evidence, of the arguments that have in fact been put forward in favour of the needs</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of this profitable sector of the market. In doing so, they have continuously emphasised the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perspective that was trailed particularly by Trevor Kavanagh and Kelvin MacKenzie in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seminars and underlined by editors and journalists working for titles from these sectors when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they gave evidence. They have kept at the front of my mind the ways in which those titles</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appeal to their very large readership and the vital importance of ensuring that it is taken into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">account in full measure &#8211; which I have done.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The role of the Assessors was described by me in my ruling of 17 October 2011, when I said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;27. It is obviously desirable (as the Prime Minister and others have identified) that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I obtain advice and assistance from those who have made their lives and careers in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the various areas covered by the Inquiry, in particular in relation to dealings between</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the press and the public, the press and politicians and the propriety of press contact</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with the police. Not least, this is because I would be keen to understand any flaws or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">unintended consequences that might flow from suggestions that are advanced that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my lack of experience would not otherwise identify. That is not to make the assessors</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">advocates for any particular cause and that is not how I (or they) see their role.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Neither has any of the Assessors sought to act as an advocate. It has recently been suggested</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in a number of press reports that, in the some way, I have been subject, on the part of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">my Assessors, to hidden lobbying, political partisanship or self-interested influence with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specific agendas in mind. That is untrue. Having spent over 40 years seeking to persuade</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or influence, or listening to others trying to do the same, if it had been attempted or even</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">crept in unconsciously, I would have detected it very quickly. I have found the assistance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">my Assessors, in their areas of expertise and experience, invaluable. They will, however, not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mind my saying here what I have assured them of many times as we have gone along: that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">my task in response has been to sift, weigh and test what they have said and make such use</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of it as seems to me right.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It should be remembered that the Assessors were selected by the Prime Minister who, I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">repeat, described them as having been chosen &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> for</span><span style="font-style:italic"> their</span><span style="font-style:italic"> complete</span><span style="font-style:italic"> independence</span><span style="font-style:italic"> from</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interested parties&#8221;.<span style="font-style:normal"> The</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Leader</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Opposition</span><span style="font-style:normal"> welcomed</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Inquiry</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span> &#8220;indeed the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">length and satisfied myself that the Prime Minister was right.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Full declarations of possible conflict were made by each before the start of the Inquiry:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">along with their CVs, these have been published on the Inquiry website throughout. When</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">challenging the position of the Assessors in the argument that led to the ruling to which I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have referred, Jonathan Caplan QC for Associated Newspapers Ltd submitted that the three</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalist Assessors were not representative of the industry but made it clear, in terms, that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he recognised that there was no statutory requirement that an Assessor be impartial.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup> I</span>


<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">underlinethat.ItisanAssessor&#8217;stasktooffermethebenefitofhisorherpersonalperspective,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expertise and experience. It is mine to take the impartial view.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The duty of confidence which the Assessors owe by law in relation to the internal deliberations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Inquiry is there to enable them to provide their expertise fully and frankly and to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protect them from external pressures. In fact, nothing that the Assessors have said or done</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">during the course of the Inquiry would allow anyone to suggest that they had gone any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further than precisely to perform the role set out in my ruling. I make one further point about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Assessors. None has been concerned with or involved in any the decisions of fact, where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have had to make my mind up about what I considered had been established to the relevant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standard. Those parts of the Report that depend only on a forensic analysis of issues of fact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or issues outside their expertise (for example, Part I Chapter 6 in relation to the bid for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">shares of BSkyB plc), have not even been seen prior to publication of the Report.</span>

<a name="section3"></a>
<h2>3. Visits</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In an effort, at least in part, to assuage concern that I had no experience or perception of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the issues faced by the newspaper industry and the way in which newspapers operate, I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been very willing to receive evidence on the topic. Additionally, I offered to undertake</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private visits to any newspaper title that invited me. I was clear that one such newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be regionally based and, prior to the commencement of the Inquiry, I visited the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Southern Daily Echo in Southampton, the offices of Associated Newspapers Ltd (The Daily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mail and The Sunday Mail), Trinity Mirror plc (The Daily Mirror, The Sunday Mirror and The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">People) and News International Ltd (The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times). I was treated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with courtesy at each and shown not only the layout and operation but also aspects of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">production of online editions.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Towards the end of the hearings, I was invited to the offices of the Press Complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commission: having regard to the very extensive evidence that I had received both as to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operation of the Commission and the approach of its staff, I felt that to do so could give rise to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">misunderstanding and, furthermore, did not consider that it would add to my understanding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the issues. In the circumstances, I declined that invitation.</span>
