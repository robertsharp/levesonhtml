<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Rule 13 of the Inquiry Rules 2006: the approach</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prior to the publication of any Report which includes explicit or significant criticism of any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">person, the Inquiry Rules 2006 mandate that such a person must be warned of that criticism</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and given a reasonable opportunity to respond. I set out the background and the legal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">framework in a ruling on the Application of Rule 13<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> which I can do no better than repeat:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;8. One of the touchstones of the inquisitorial process prescribed by the 2005</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">[Inquiries] Act is the requirement of fairness to all. Whereas s. 17(1) of the Act provides</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the procedure and conduct of the Inquiry shall be such as I direct, that provision</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is subject to s. 17(3) in these terms:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In making any decision as to the procedure or conduct of an inquiry, the chairman</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">must act with fairness and with regard to the need to avoid any unnecessary cost</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(whether to public funds or to witnesses or others).&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">9. No higher manifestation of that duty is apparent than that which deals with the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">requirement that those who may be criticised in any report have the opportunity</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">afforded to them to deal with the basis of that criticism. The origin is to be found</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the Royal Commission on Tribunals of Inquiry (Cmnd 3121, 1966) (&#8220;the Salmon</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Report&#8221;) which proposed, among other recommendations, that before a person was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">called as a witness, he should be informed of any allegations which are made against</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">him and the substance of the evidence in support of them: thus were born Salmon</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">letters although over-rigid adherence has been recognised as &#8216;unhelpful&#8217;: see the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">observations of Sir Richard Scott VC (in (1995) 111 LQR 596) to the effect that every</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">inquiry must adapt its procedures to meet its own circumstances.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">10. The next manifestation of this requirement (described as &#8216;fair play in action&#8217; by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Sachs LJ in Re Pergamon Press Ltd [1971] Ch 388 at 405) dealt with comment on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proposed criticism. Mr Robert Maxwell&#8217;s attempt to obtain sight of proposed draft</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">conclusions was rejected in the Court of Appeal when Lawton LJ put the matter in this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">way: see Maxwell v Department of Trade and Industry [1974] QB 523 at page 541B-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">D: &#8220;Those who conduct inquiries have to base their decisions, findings, conclusions or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">opinions ... on the evidence. In my judgment they are no more bound to tell a witness</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">likely to be criticised in their report what they have in mind to say about him than has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a judge sitting alone who has to decide which of two conflicting witnesses is telling</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the truth. The judge must ensure that the witness whose credibility is suspected has a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fair opportunity of correcting or contradicting the substance of what other witnesses</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have said or are expected to say which is in conflict with his testimony. Inspectors</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should do the same but I can see no reason why they should do any more.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">11. Notwithstanding these judicial observations, the broad process was adopted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by Lord Bingham in the BCCI Inquiry, by Sir Richard Scott in the Inquiry into Matrix</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Churchill and also by Sir John Chilcott in the Iraq Inquiry. This lack of clarity is itself</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">unhelpful and potentially productive either of very substantial delay or satellite</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">litigation (in each case with attendant cost) or both.</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">12. The 2005 Act (pursuant to which this Inquiry is being conducted) adopts a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">different and, in my judgment, self-contained approach to ensure fairness. First, s. 21</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the Act provides that I may by notice require any person to provide evidence in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">form of a written statement along with documents. Such notices have identified, in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">comprehensive terms, the issues with which the statement has been required to deal;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">where appropriate, it has identified relevant documents or other public statements</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which should be addressed. It cannot, of course, deal with evidence not then seen by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry but where issues of significance have arisen before the witness arrives,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">forewarning has been given and, if necessary, witnesses allowed time to deal with a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">matter for which they were not prepared. Where the issue has arisen only after the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">witness has given evidence, again if it is significant, second statements have been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">requested and obtained; more than one witness has been required to return to give</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">further evidence.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">13. The second (and most extensive) protection is provided by Rules 13-15 of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Inquiry Rules 2006 (&#8216;the 2006 Rules&#8217;) which concern what are described as Warning</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Letters. Thus, Rule 13 provides:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(1) The Chairman may send a warning letter to any person:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) he considers maybe, or who has been, subject to criticism in the inquiry</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proceedings; or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) about whom criticism may be inferred from evidence that has been given</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">during the inquiry proceedings; or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) who may be subject to criticism in the report, or any interim report.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(2) The recipient of a warning letter may disclose it to his recognised legal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">representative.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(3) The inquiry panel must not include any explicit or significant criticism of a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">person in the report, or in any interim report, unless</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) the chairman has sent that person a warning letter; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) the person has been given a reasonable opportunity to respond to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">warning letter.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In my ruling, I explained the ways in which I have sought to ensure that the Inquiry was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conducted fairly and with full regard to the position of all who might be affected. In relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rule 13, therefore, I concluded that a warning addressed to a section of the press consisting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the national titles (even if a number of those have not been the subject of criticism or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaint) allowed each to make submissions as to the conclusions that I should draw as to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the culture, practices and ethics of the press generally (as opposed to the specific conduct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of individual titles although it has been made clear titles have been free to comment on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stories which are identifiably referable to them). I went on to conclude not only that generic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criticisms should be evidence based, but that the justification for my concerns should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;visible and capable of being understood both by those affected and by the public&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I appreciate (as was argued by Mr Desmond Browne QC for Trinity Mirror plc) that this could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allow anyone following the references through to the transcript to identify the titles and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perhaps, the relevant journalists; in reality, however, that would be possible whether or not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I identified the references and, on the basis that I have not made specific findings in most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual cases, this approach does not offend the general principle that I am not focussing</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">on the detail of &#8216;who did what to whom&#8217;. It is equally consistent with the principle that my</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intention not to prejudice criminal proceedings means that I have not identified those alleged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to have been involved in mobile phone interception; therefore, in fairness, although there are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exceptions when I have considered that the narrative compels specificity, generally speaking,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have exercised similar restraint in respect of those, not being investigated, who may be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsible for similar or other illegal or unethical practices.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Conscious that any approach to Rule 13 was likely to be contentious, I arranged for the matter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be argued in principle and ruled on the approach generally. This ruling fell within to s38(1)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) of the Inquiries Act 2005 and had any Core Participant wished to challenge it by way</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of judicial review, that course was open within 14 days. There was no such challenge and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">insofar as generic criticism is concerned, I have followed it.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have, however, issued Rule 13 warnings to individuals (and others concerned with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship between the press and the public) in those circumstances where I thought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fairness warranted it and, in particular, when I was concerned that any conclusion that I might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reach in relation to a specific incident could be said to contain an express or implied criticism</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of them. The touchstone has been to provide an opportunity to make representations about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identifiable concerns that I was proposing to express.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having said that, it is important that I emphasise that this Report should not be read as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">addressing the individual conduct of members of the press in their dealings with the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and no implied criticism should be read into the fact that references to particular complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are inevitably to particular stories written by identifiable journalists (albeit not named in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">text of the Report). I cannot repeat too often that this part of the Inquiry is not concerned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with individual conduct but with the culture, practices and ethics of the press (or a section of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press) as a whole. Who would be to blame for a particular egregious story? Would it be a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proprietor or editor who ordained a particular approach or a particular agenda? Would it be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the journalist who felt driven to do what had been bidden irrespective of personal qualms?</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Would it be the sub-editor who wrote a headline that misrepresented what should be derived</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from correctly identified facts or modified the words of caution that the journalist had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">carefully included? How could I decide between these cumulative or alternative possibilities?</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the circumstances, I have only been able to take the story at face value along with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reaction of the subject of the story and my view of the law (for example in relation to privacy)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The result of this analysis is that, in relation to most of the complaints made by those who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been subject to press intrusion I have not issued Rule 13 letters. This is because I do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not intend either expressly or by implication to make explicit or significant criticism of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant journalists (rather than, generically, of the press). If I had done otherwise, hundreds</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of journalists (if not more), most of whom have neither been asked nor volunteered to give</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence to the Inquiry or even to make a statement, would have had to receive a warning.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having said that, if, in any particular case or in relation to any particular example that I wish</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to highlight, I have been in doubt, I have issued a warning and provided an opportunity for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">representations to be made. In reaching my conclusions, I have taken full account of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">representations that I have received in response to all these warnings including those issued</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generically to the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In relation to Module Two and the police, different considerations apply on the basis that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there being no ongoing criminal investigation into the conduct of the MPS (although there are</span>
<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">inquiries into other aspects of police conduct in relation to the press).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> On the other hand,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I received detailed submissions from Counsel for the MPS both generally and specifically</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as to the interaction of Parts 1 and 2 of the Inquiry. In the circumstances, I separately ruled</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to the application of Rule 13 both to the MPS and to individual police officers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Again, I have followed it and issued Rule 13 letters both general and specific in nature, taking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">full account of the representations that I have received.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Module Three raised different issues for a number of reasons. First, there is no criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation that could affect my approach and, in addition, it does not appear that there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will be any other consideration of the general issues which I have to address in the Terms of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Reference; that might be thought to be a basis for encouraging me to range further and wider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than in relation to the other modules. On the other hand, the Terms of Reference are specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the culture, practices and ethics of the press &#8216;including contacts and the relationships</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between national newspapers and politicians, and the conduct of each&#8217;. It is argued that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry should investigate the nature of friendships between individual members of the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and individual politicians but, save to the extent that these bite or may bite upon the way in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which a journalist (or politician) attend to his or her professional duties, it does not appear to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">me that it is necessary or appropriate for me to enquire. Throughout the hearing of Module</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Three, I emphasised that politicians were entitled to be friendly with whosoever they wished;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">absent some impact on the public interest, it is no part of the work of the Inquiry to challenge</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that right.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-10"><a href="#para1-10" name="para1-10">1.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, each of the major UK political parties has recognised, in general terms, that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship between politicians and the press has become too close: indeed, that was the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusion expressed by the Prime Minister and his three predecessors when they gave</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence. For me to express that conclusion, however, undeniably constitutes an &#8216;explicit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or significant criticism&#8217; in respect of which I must issue a Rule 13 letter. Such a criticism,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">however, is not intended to be personal but generic. It recognises that how close is too close</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is itself a very difficult and nuanced issue, given that it is critically important, in a democratic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">society, that politicians engage with the press and seek to explain their policies to the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">through the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-11"><a href="#para1-11" name="para1-11">1.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The third concern has been the extent to which the work of the Inquiry has involved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contemporary political issues with the risk of entering into a party political debate which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is no part of its function: this particularly relates to the attempted acquisition News Corp</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the publicly owned shares in BSkyB Ltd. I made it clear that I would not opine on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ministerial Code or seek to prevent Parliament from investigating whatever aspect of the bid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it wished to investigate;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> however, I recognise that it constitutes the most recent and most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">well documented inter-reaction between a very powerful media organisation and politicians</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(although the interaction in relation to the legislative proposals now contained in s77-78</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 which has not yet been implemented are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also important). I have, therefore, attempted to analyse these issues from a general, cultural</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perspective: the process has inevitably involved a consideration of individual decisions and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the basis that, even if not explicit, implied significant criticism may be inferred, I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issued appropriate warnings accordingly.</span>



<!--new page--><p id="para-id-1-12"><a href="#para1-12" name="para1-12">1.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I can deal with Module Four quite shortly. In this Report, each of the ideas put before the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry has been subject to rigorous analysis and none more so than the proposals advanced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by Lord Black of Brentwood (on behalf of the Press Board of Finance) and advocated by,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">among others, Lord Hunt of Wirral, the Chairman of the Press Complaints Commission. It is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">right that they should be, not least because, from the outset of the Inquiry and throughout,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I encouraged the press to put forward their own ideas for press regulation, bearing in mind</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not only the values which it held to be important but also the interests of the public as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">demonstrated not only by the demand for this Inquiry but also by the evidence which has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been given to it.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-13"><a href="#para1-13" name="para1-13">1.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I appreciate that Lord Black has had to deal with a wide spread of press interest; I have no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">doubt that different constituents have put forward different priorities and different ideas and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, furthermore, Lord Black has done his best to bring everyone to a common consensus</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which I expect is also consistent with his own ideas. Any concern or criticism that I have of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the final formulation, however, is not a criticism of him or, indeed, any other person whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual or corporate: neither should it be seen as such. In those circumstances, I have not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">felt it appropriate or necessary to give advance warning of my concerns but have simply set</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them out in the body of the Report.</span>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>2. Rule 13 of the Inquiry Rules 2006: the practice</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The reason for the existence of Rule 13 of the Inquiry Rules is clear from this analysis. Flowing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from that, however, are two further consequences. The first is the fact that a notice is only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary to address potential criticism: it is not intended to present a balanced picture of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any sort. Nobody needs to be warned of the risk that their conduct might be applauded. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">point was clear from the body of the letter which explained:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;By definition, this letter is focussed on the aspects of the culture, practices and ethics</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the press which may attract criticism and it is not the function of this letter to refer</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the evidence of good culture, practice and ethics which the Inquiry has received.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second consequence flows from the first. A possible criticism should not be interpreted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as one that will inevitably be made. As a result, the letter also made it clear that both it and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any response were subject to &#8220;a legal duty of confidence&#8221; owed in the public interest under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rule 14(1)(b) of the Inquiry Rules 2006.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> This requirement (expressly mandated in the Rules)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is specifically designed to discourage public discussion or debate about criticisms which have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not yet been made and which could well, in the end, be less serious. It was and is, therefore,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a demonstrable attempt to be fair and to provide an opportunity to those who might be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">affected to make submissions about possible criticism at a time when, as I made clear, I was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">continuing to reflect on the narrative and conclusions which I would reach and before I had</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">done so.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thus, although it has been portrayed as such, the letter is not intended to be a secret: it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only confidential until the Report is signed or published,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> after which time anyone is free to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discuss the letters, criticise their content and analyse the extent to which my views might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have changed. My concluded view, as expressed in the Report, will then be available.</span>


<!--new page--><p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is therefore not in the least surprising that the letters are &#8220;one-sided,&#8221; that the positive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should not be subject to a similar letter, or that I would be concerned if the contents were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being openly discussed in the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> All are, of course, entitled to express whatever view</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they wish about the summary of press practice that can be culled from the evidence but it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">worth repeating (not for the first, or the last, time) that the criticisms that I have suggested</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were not directed at the entirety of the press: most journalists, most if not all the time, do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not behave in the way that, on my assessment of the evidence, a small but not insignificant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number have behaved, thereby generating criticism of the culture that permitted this to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">happen, the practices involved and the ethics of those who have behaved in that way. As in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">every other walk of life, regulation is required for the small minority.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">great care, always in the context of my ultimate obligation under section 17 of the Inquiries</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Act to act fairly. I am completely satisfied that all recipients who have chosen to submit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantive responses have understood the issues in respect of which I have sought further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assistance, and have addressed them in appropriate detail. In the few instances where it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appeared that recipients might have misunderstood the point that I wished them to have the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opportunity to address, I have provided further explanation and given them that opportunity.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the result, many of my provisional conclusions have been revised or reformulated to reflect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Rule 13 process and the representations that I have received.</span>

<h2>3. The nature and standard of proof</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Thestartingpointforanyconsiderationofthenatureofwhatmustbeprovedandthestandard</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of proof is, from the outset, to recognise that the Inquiry has been set up specifically because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;particular events have caused ... public concern&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> To some extent, it is sufficient simply to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">refer back to the Terms of Reference of Part 1 of the Inquiry but, summarising at least the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">most important of these events, it would be appropriate to include as topics about which I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been required to inquire:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) the disclosure of the interception of Milly Dowler&#8217;s mobile phone messages and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deletion of such messages;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) the fact that it was common ground that the News of the World had engaged in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interception of mobile phone messages (revealed in civil litigation and otherwise)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contrary to the continued assertion that Clive Goodman was one &#8220;rogue reporter&#8221;;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) other complaints of illegal or unethical methods by which journalists obtained stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(not the least significant being activity in breach of Data Protection legislation leading</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to a concern about the policy, operation and effectiveness of the regulatory regime for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">data protection);</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) the harassment and pressure placed both on members of the public caught up in stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attracting enormous press coverage and those in the public eye whether because of</span>
<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">their celebrity or otherwise;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) the failure of the Press Complaints Commission to address the activities of the News</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the World (save only to exonerate them and criticise The Guardian for its reporting);</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to provide adequate regulatory oversight in relation to the press; to provide adequate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">redress for those complaining of press misconduct save in limited circumstances; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to ensure that its remit embraced the press as a whole;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(f) the nature of the relationship between the press and the police and, in particular, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extent to which failure of the police properly to investigate the extent of interception</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of mobile phone messages was a consequence of that relationship;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(g) thewayinwhichpoliticiansengagedwiththepressand,inparticular,theextenttowhich</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the commercial interests of the press influenced the development or implementation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of policy, along with the failure to address prior concerns over many years relating to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media misconduct; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(h) the impact of the plurality of the media and cross media ownership on the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">More important than the topics about which I am required to inquire are the subjects</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about which I am required to make recommendations. It is sufficient to repeat the Terms of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Reference which are expressed in this way:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;To make recommendations:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) for a new more effective policy and regulatory regime which supports</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the integrity and freedom of the press, the plurality of the media, and its</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">independence, including from Government, while encouraging the highest</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ethical and professional standards;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) for how future concerns about press behaviour, media policy, regulation and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cross-media ownership should be dealt with by all the relevant authorities,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">including Parliament, Government, the prosecuting authorities and the police;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) the future conduct of relations between politicians and the press; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(d) the future conduct of relations between the police and the press.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These issues are to be contrasted with those set out in Part 2 of the Terms of Reference,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which are specifically directed to a far more fact focussed investigation of the conduct of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News International and other newspaper organisations (&#8220;the extent of unlawful or improper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conduct&#8221;, &#8220;the extent of corporate governance and management failures&#8221;), along with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police (&#8220;the extent to which the police received corrupt payments or other inducements,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or were otherwise complicit in such misconduct or in suppressing its proper investigation&#8221;)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and politicians (&#8220;the role, if any, of politicians, public servants and others in relation to any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">failure to investigate wrongdoing at News International&#8221;). In Part 2, there is a requirement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;to consider the implications&#8221; of what is then found to have happened. In other words, Part</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1 of this Inquiry is a qualitative exercise of sufficient breadth to determine the appropriate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations to make for the future. Part 2 is a quantitative exercise: how extensive have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been the identified failures in News International, other press organisations, the police, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">political class, public servants or others? On that basis, the implications (and any additional</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations fall to be addressed. Part 2 requires a far greater and more detailed factual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation than has Part 1: this is not surprising given that the Terms of Reference were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">split into two because of the ongoing police investigation and the lack of clarity as to where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it might lead).</span>
<!--new page--><p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Against that background it is necessary to consider the overriding obligation as to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">procedure or conduct of the Inquiry, which requires me &#8220;to act with fairness and with regard</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the need to avoid any unnecessary cost&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> Further, although the Inquiry may &#8220;not rule on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and has no power to determine, any person&#8217;s civil or criminal liability&#8221;, it is not inhibited in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the discharge of its function &#8220;by any likelihood of liability being inferred from the facts that it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">determines or recommendations that it makes&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup> Subject to this framework, the obligation is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">set out in s24(1) of the Inquiries Act 2005 in these terms:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Chairman of an inquiry must deliver a report to the Minister setting out &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(a) the facts determined by the inquiry panel;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) the recommendations of the panel ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The report may also contain anything else that the panel considers to be relevant to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the terms of reference (including any recommendations the panel sees fit to make</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">despite not being required to do so by the terms of reference)&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The facts as determined, however, are those which are necessary in order to provide the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context for the recommendations. Focussing on the relationship between the press and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public, therefore, the submission that a single or occasional instance of misconduct will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not itself justify any adverse finding about the culture, practices or ethics of the press is to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proceed on the mistaken basis of thinking quantitatively rather than qualitatively. In relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the future of regulation, the question whether a new regime is appropriate must be asked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by reference to how the present regulatory regime has dealt with such issues as have arisen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and whether it retains public confidence. If problems with or concerns about the culture,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and ethics of the press are &#8211; represented by a single or occasional example &#8211; it may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not be appropriate or necessary to recommend any change. Nobody, however, has submitted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this is the case. It is not challenged that there is legitimate public concern about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory regime which it is no longer suggested is fit for purpose; the issue is the extent of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that problem and the benefits and detriments of possible solutions.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Neither does it matter that any problem is limited to one or a small number of titles. A</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory regime must deal with all titles and be in a position appropriately to deal with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">even a single recalcitrant paper; it is irrelevant if one or more title never attracts its adverse</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attention. To that extent, the approach of at least one newspaper group to the Inquiry,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">restricting itself to demonstrating how illegal or unethical activity cannot be placed at its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">door, has wholly missed the point. I have no intention of either applauding one paper for its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">culture, practices and ethics or (with the exception of the NoTW) of condemning another. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reason for the exception is so that the public do not ascribe to other titles the many criticisms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that have been articulated about that one. What I sought from all Core Participants (but have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not always received) was an analysis of the extent to which, as a matter of generality, there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was a problem with the culture, practices and ethics of the press or a section of the press,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so that it would be possible to consider a new and sufficiently robust policy and regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regime which supports the integrity and freedom of the press but also reflects the legitimate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rights of others.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In argument, it has been submitted that it is appropriate for the Inquiry to express its findings</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at a high level of generality. The point is made in this way. It does not matter whether,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for example, phone hacking occurred only at one title or was more widespread since it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is an established problem of conduct by at least part of the press which will inform the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommendations made. Similarly, the problem of intrusion on grief identified by certain</span>


<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">witnesses is a problem of conduct by at least part of the press and it matters not for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">purpose of making recommendations whether it occurred only at one title, at several titles,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or at all titles. From this perspective the Inquiry can find that there are &#8216;concerns&#8217; about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">alleged press misconduct without determining whether the particular type of misconduct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occurred on one occasion or one hundred, at one title or many. This puts the qualitative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">versus the quantitative argument at its highest.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">To a point, the argument is well made and correct. I have already concluded, however, that a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">single or occasional instance of misconduct may not be sufficient to justify an adverse finding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about culture, practices and ethics on the basis that it is of no real significance. Neither am I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prepared to proceed on the basis that the argument of &#8216;one rogue reporter&#8217; can be replaced,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the remainder of the press, with an argument of &#8216;one rogue newspaper title&#8217;: if that is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what I consider the position to be, I shall so conclude. That does not require me to decide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">how extensive was the practice or knowledge of phone hacking (although keeping quiet</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about a known abuse of the law by another title itself says something about culture, practices</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and ethics, on the basis that who otherwise will hold the press to account) but, in any event,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">illegality and unethical behaviour comes in many different forms and it is the overall picture</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that is critical.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That is not to say that I will not deal with individual cases because worked examples can</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exemplify the problems that exist even in titles that are not the subject of repeated complaint</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and these may add to the overall picture. As a consequence, it is important to underline that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is not an inevitable inference that the culture, practices and ethics of the title affected is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">driven by the problem that I am exemplifying. Each generality along with each example is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intended to provide or add to the narrative of facts against which to judge the regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regime and consider what should now take its place.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-10"><a href="#para3-10" name="para3-10">3.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Against that background, a consideration of the standard of proof becomes much more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">straightforward. I accept that the public interest requires that the findings of the Inquiry are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expressed in such a way that can readily be understood to be a judgment on what has occurred</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and why any recommendations have been made and, furthermore, that the appropriate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standard is that applicable in all but criminal cases, namely the balance of probability. To put</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it more colloquially, before reaching a conclusion, for example, that an event has happened,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I must conclude that its occurrence is more likely than not. I further recognise both from an</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the more careful the analysis of the facts will have to be not least because of the reduced</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In my ruling in relation to the application of Rule 13 of the Inquiry Rules 2006, I raised the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question whether it was sufficient that I consider whether the evidence reveals such a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern about particular conduct that regulatory arrangements should be put in place to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the power so to conclude &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> should</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> exercised</span><span style="font-style:italic"> sparingly</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-12"><a href="#para3-12" name="para3-12">3.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I accept that unresolved suspicions, on their own, do not provide a sufficient basis for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusions, in particular as to the success or otherwise of the present regulatory regime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but the words &#8216;on their own&#8217; are important. By way of example, I can conclude without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">difficulty that mobile phone interception was far more extensive at the NoTW than was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">initially admitted and I can also be satisfied that knowledge of the technique was far more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">widespread than the confines of the NoTW but, until the Guardian article in 2009, it was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">addressed by the press or the PCC.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-13"><a href="#para3-13" name="para3-13">3.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That alone is likely to be sufficient to justify a new approach to regulation but it seems to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">me that I can (and should) be able to go much further. A considerable body of evidence has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been adduced which gives rise to reasonable grounds for believing that knowledge of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practice was linked to its use, albeit there is not the hard evidence (such as comes from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire material) of names, telephone numbers and the like. It seems to me that it could be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">possible to conclude, inferentially, on the balance of probability, that others were involved in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the practice; it might be fairer, however, (and sufficient to add to the weight of any conclusion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the need for a new approach to regulation) simply to conclude that there are strong</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasonable grounds for believing that it did. I recognise, however, the need for real caution</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">before proceeding along these lines.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-14"><a href="#para3-14" name="para3-14">3.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Jonathan Caplan QC for Associated Newspapers Ltd argues that any general statement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there are grounds to suspect senior executives within a section of the national press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of knowledge, concealment or acquiescence in voicemail interception raised very serious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reputational issues for those senior personnel reasonably considered by the public to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within that section of the press (that is to say the tabloid or popular press). It is argued that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such conclusions should not be reached unless the evidence discloses objectively reasonable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">grounds to suspect those executives which it cannot because there has been no proper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation of the issue.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-15"><a href="#para3-15" name="para3-15">3.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have not singled out &#8216;senior executives&#8217; for special mention but it is important to make the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">point that this should not and does not mean that, in appropriate cases, individual titles (and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual executives or journalists) will not be identified or identifiable. The effect of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argument that to do so offends my general approach is that I would not be able to reach any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusion because to criticise any individual title or group is to criticise the editor. This is no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more than a repetition of the argument that I rejected in the ruling on Rule 13 concerning</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the implied criticism of those involved<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup> which was not thereafter challenged. I am certainly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prepared to accept, however, that I should not criticise any individual by name unless satisfied</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the balance of probability that such criticism is justified.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-16"><a href="#para3-16" name="para3-16">3.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Similar, but not identical, reasoning applies to my approach to the relations between the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press and the police (Module Two) and the press and politicians (Module Three) and I will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">express my conclusions about the nature and impact of those relationships on the balance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">probability. In both of these cases, there is no complication of pending criminal investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which could limit my ability to focus on individual conduct.</span>


<!--new page--><p id="para-id-3-17"><a href="#para3-17" name="para3-17">3.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In connection both with the police and with politicians, the material before the Inquiry is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficient to reach conclusions on the important questions without having to consider issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of reasonable suspicion but the complication in these relationships arises in connection with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the additional question of perception. Thus, by way of example, it has been suggested that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;deals&#8217; were struck between the press and politicians to the mutual advantage of both. That</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allegation has been strenuously denied both by the press and by politicians. Quite apart</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from that, however, there is the very different issue of whether, even assuming there was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no such &#8216;deal&#8217;, the behaviour of both gave rise to legitimate perception in the public that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship was being conducted in a way that was not in the public interest. On that basis,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it may be entirely wrong to suggest or conclude that there was impropriety of any sort but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">still correct to decide that the way in which the relationship is handled from the perspective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both of the press and politicians requires adjustment so that each can perform their duty but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in a way that does not give rise an adverse perception. A similar problem arises in connection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the relationships between the press and the police (in particular in relation to the refusal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to re-open investigations into mobile phone interception).</span>
