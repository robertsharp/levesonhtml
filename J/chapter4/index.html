<h1>CHAPTER 4<br/>THE PRESS COMPLAINTS COMMISSION AND ITS EFFECTIVENESS</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) has always been a voluntary system based on a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">network of implied contracts. Accordingly, participation has been optional, and in the event</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">never universal; and has always been contingent on an evaluation by individual titles or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publishers of their self-interest. Newspapers notionally sign up, and remain tied into the rules</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the system, but only for the period and to the extent that they judge that this is in their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">best interests. The self-regulatory system as a whole, and by this I include its less visible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">elements, the Press Board of Finance (PressBoF) and the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice Committee,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are intertwined legally and functionally symbiotic.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It follows from this that criticisms of the PCC have often been too specifically directed and as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such may have missed their mark; it is the system as a whole which should be the accurate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">target. The way in which the various parts interact is the hallmark of the system as I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">broadly defined it; in a less obvious but equally powerful way it should also be regarded as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the key descriptor of the relationship that the industry has with the PCC. Although the system</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as constituted in this manner unravelled, in spectacular fashion, in July 2011, the inherent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">weakness was there for all to see almost from the very start.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There were aspects of the work that the PCC did well which should not be overlooked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or minimised as the weaknesses of the system are exposed. The secretariat worked very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hard; in many cases the PCC managed to negotiate or mediate settlements which resulted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in proportionate redress and satisfied complainants. Some of the pre-publication work</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undertaken by the PCC was effective and has assisted people under real pressure from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry. The two directors of the PCC who gave evidence on these matters<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> were impressive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and dedicated individuals who worked tirelessly, often in difficult circumstances.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Throughout, my Report has not sought to blame individuals but to focus on practices and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">systems. I will continue with this approach although the evidence demonstrates that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stature and profile of the PCC has, to some considerable extent, depended on the quality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and personality of its Chairs. In the circumstances, I will refer to each of the four who gave</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence; they tackled different issues at different times and did so with differing degrees</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of success. This analysis of their stewardship of the PCC is a significant part of the overall</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">narrative. Even so, my headline assessment is that the problem was and is systemic: the PCC is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hidebound by its inherent structure such that it has lacked the powers and sanctions required</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to do an effective job, which was &#8211; or at least ought to have been &#8211; to regulate the industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under its umbrella. Instead, self-regulation was simultaneously a panacea, a misnomer and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a contradiction in terms. The press caused or permitted it to pronounce itself as a model of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">self-regulation for the press as a whole but the upshot was something well short of regulation</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">properly so-called.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC was not independent from the industry it was overseeing, causing problems both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of substance and of perception. The way in which it and the self-regulatory system more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generally conducted itself in public was often unhelpful. The purported investigations into</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref1" name="footnote1" title="Go back to footnote reference 1 in the text">1</a>.  Guy Black, as he then was, was director of the PCC until 2003, but his evidence did not cover this part of his career. Ihave no reason to exempt him from the observations I make about his successors</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1515"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">press misconduct, most notably the two reports into phone hacking, were ineffectual and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inadequate; and their conclusions, apparently exculpating the News of the World (NoTW),</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, as it happens all other titles, from the accusations of serious misconduct, gave false</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">comfort to policy-makers and the public. Taken together these factors caused the self-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory system to fail. However good the rest of the work that the PCC did, it steadily lost</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the trust of key stakeholders, culminating in a final flight of trust and confidence in the wake</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the revelations which triggered this Inquiry to be set up.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By July 2011, some might say somewhat late in the day, key politicians had also lost faith in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the self-regulatory system. On 8 July 2011, the Prime Minister said that the PCC had failed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and needed to be replaced:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s be honest. The Press Complaints Commission has failed. In this case, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hacking case, frankly it was pretty much absent. Therefore we have to conclude that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it&#8217;s ineffective and lacking in rigour.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There is a strong case for saying it&#8217;s institutionally conflicted because competing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapers judge each other. As a result it lacks public confidence. I believe we need</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a new system entirely. It will be for the inquiry to recommend what the system should</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">look like.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;But my starting presumption is that it should be truly independent, independent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from the press, so the public will know that newspapers will never again be solely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">responsible for policing themselves. But vitally, independent of government, so the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public will know that politicians are not trying to control or muzzle a press that must</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be free to hold politicians to account.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Deputy Prime Minister also agreed that the PCC and the self-regulatory system generally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had failed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> The Leader of the Opposition, said in a speech on 8 July 2011 that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;we need wholesale reform of our system of regulation. The Press Complaints</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Commission has failed. It failed to get to the bottom of the allegations about what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">happened at News International in 2009. Its chair admits she was lied to but could do</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nothing about it. The PCC was established to be a watchdog. But it has been exposed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as a toothless poodle. Wherever blame lies for this, the PCC cannot restore trust in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">self-regulation. It is time to put the PCC out of its misery. We need a new watchdog.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Significant sections of the press had also lost confidence in the self-regulatory system. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">January 2011, by refusing to make the appropriate contribution through PressBoF, Northern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">& Shell left the PCC which meant that it could no longer offer a service in relation to Express</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Newspapers or the Star titles. Both Richard Desmond, the proprietor of the Northern & Shell</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">group, and Paul Ashford the Group Editorial Director, gave evidence that one of the key factors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that prompted Northern & Shell&#8217;s withdrawal from the self-regulatory structure was that they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had lost confidence in the PCC; in particular, they were not confident of its independence.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></span>

<a name="page1516"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">Even if there may have been an element of the self-serving in this assessment, it is not difficult</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to understand why that might have been. In any event, other key newspaper figures had also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">begun to lose faith in the PCC. The editor of the Financial Times, Lionel Barber, gave evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Inquiry that the PCC&#8217;s decision to criticise the Guardian in its 2009 report into phone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking was a serious misstep, and that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> as</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> result</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> believe</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> body</span><span style="font-style:italic"> has</span><span style="font-style:italic"> lost</span></span>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, the self-regulatory system was not trusted by many of the organisations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">representingtheinterestsofthepeopleandgroupswhobecamethesubjectofmediacoverage.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For example Trans Media Watch, an organisation dedicated to combating discriminatory and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or derogatory coverage of transgender and intersex people in the media, submitted evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;The</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Press</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Complaints</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Commission</span><span style="font-style:italic"> (PCC)</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> widely</span><span style="font-style:italic"> regarded</span><span style="font-style:italic"> as</span><span style="font-style:italic"> an</span><span style="font-style:italic"> ineffective</span><span style="font-style:italic"> joke</span><span style="font-style:italic"> by</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">those who had been the victims of press intrusion, likewise did not have confidence in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC. The actor Steve Coogan, for example, gave evidence that he did not have confidence in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the independence of the PCC, and concluded that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> If</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> had</span><span style="font-style:italic"> more</span><span style="font-style:italic"> faith</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> then</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I&#8217;d</span><span style="font-style:italic"> use</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-10"><a href="#para1-10" name="para1-10">1.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Experienced media lawyers, who have dealt routinely with issues of inaccuracy and intrusion,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both of which fall within the PCC&#8217;s remit, also gave evidence that they had lost faith in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">capacity of the PCC. Mark Thomson, a lawyer who has represented many victims of press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intrusion, was of the view that the PCC was not sufficiently effective or independent of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> Another media lawyer, Graham Shear, agreed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-11"><a href="#para1-11" name="para1-11">1.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By the summer of 2011, the standing of the self-regulatory system in general and the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in particular had deteriorated further. Although key stakeholders and observers may have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had differing experiences of the press and their views may have been coloured by various</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interests, their common conclusion that the self-regulatory structure had failed cannot be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained away by self-interest or subjective perspective.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-12"><a href="#para1-12" name="para1-12">1.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ultimately, this disintegration of trust in the PCC was the straw breaking the camel&#8217;s back. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the absence of any powers to compel anybody, the PCC was reliant on the continued trust</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and confidence of the public, politicians and the press in its authority; and in its capacity to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enforce proper standards of press behaviour. What remained of the PCC&#8217;s authority departed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the flight of trust and everyone agrees that it is no longer viable for the current self-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory structure to continue in its present form or state.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-13"><a href="#para1-13" name="para1-13">1.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I cannot emphasise too strongly that the revelations of July 2011 must not be visualised in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any sort of self-contained way as a watershed or a bolt from the blue in the context of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">21 year history of the PCC. To interpret events in such a way would, in my view, amount to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a form of historical revisionism which ignores the whole of the post-War narrative and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">performance of the PCC since its creation in 1991. Arguably, though, one may detect elements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of such an approach in some of the less than wholly self-critical statements by PressBoF and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC itself as late as 2009/2010.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having introduced the issues in this way, the next section of this Chapter will address these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">systemic issues on a thematic rather than a chronological basis. To be fair to the PCC, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be insufficient merely to rehearse the fact that political and public support for it has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evaporated. Although I have to record and recognise that, as a practical reality, since on any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view it would justify (if not require) fundamental change, the reasons for such loss of support</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">do need to be examined and set out.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-15"><a href="#para1-15" name="para1-15">1.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The sections of this Chapter that follow look by turns at the PCC&#8217;s lack of any meaningful</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independence from the industry it purported to regulate; the self-association and alignment</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">delivery. Lastly, this Chapter will examine the investigatory failures of the PCC both in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the findings of Operation Motorman and the allegations of phone hacking at the NoTW</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both in 2007 and 2009.</span>

<h2>2. What the PCC did well</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Before starting on an analysis of what went wrong, I should record what the PCC did well.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Successive witnesses gave evidence that the PCC secretariat, in particular the complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">officers who handled complaints made by members of the public, were polite, efficient and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dedicated.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup> Members of the PCC secretariat worked hard in the public interest, as I have said,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in sometimes difficult circumstances. The PCC established and then ran a 24 hour helpline</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for complainants, staffed by a small number of officers working in rotation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup> For a relatively</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">small team to have handled the large volume of complaints received by the PCC speaks of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the dedication and commitment of individual staff members. I have seen no evidence and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">heard no suggestion that the manner in which the members of the PCC secretariat have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gone about their work has led or, in any sense, contributed to the limitations of the PCC as an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisation. I have no doubt that PCC staff did as well as is possible within the bounds set by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the self-regulatory system.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I also heard evidence from the then current director of the PCC, Stephen Abell, and his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">immediate predecessor, Tim Toulmin, of the work done by PCC staff on a day to day basis. I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should add that Mr Abell&#8217;s witness statement was a genuine<span style="font-style:italic"> tour</span><span style="font-style:italic"> de</span><span style="font-style:italic"> force</span> and I pay tribute</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the immense care he has taken and the diligence he has shown. Through their respective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence, each demonstrated his dedication and loyalty to an organisation which faced a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">naturally daunting task.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The efforts of the PCC at mediation and conciliation were often helpful. Dr Martin Moore,</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">many, a mediated settlement is a sensible way of dealing with disputes between parties.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC was also, on occasion, able to mitigate extreme media pressure on newsworthy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup> Dr Gerry McCann, for example, gave evidence that the PCC managed to limit the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intrusion by journalists and press photographers into the lives of his twin son and daughter in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the aftermath of the disappearance of his daughter Madeleine:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The PCC was extremely helpful in dealing with the unwanted intrusion into the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">privacy of our twins. In particular, the press were constantly taking photographs in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which our children were included. Having contacted the PCC this quickly stopped&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Baroness Buscombe, the former Chair of the PCC, said of this aspect of the PCC&#8217;s pre-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication work that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;This is an area of [the PCC&#8217;s] work that has developed in recent years and which has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had an enormously beneficial impact&#8230; I well recall that when I began working at the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">PCC, I was amazed by the degree to which we are able to stop within hours or minutes</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the publication of information, including pictures, where there was a potential</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">breach of the Code. The key to this is strong and very responsive engagement with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the industry, night and day.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In some cases the pre-publication guidance which the PCC produced was effective, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resulted in some improvements to the press coverage of the issues concerned. For example,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC has worked hard to improve the coverage of mental health issues. To this end, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC has produced a guidance note on the subject and has delivered training to journalists.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is difficult to form a clear judgment about this, but the sense I have is that press reporting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on some aspects of mental health issues has improved, and the insensitive and in many cases</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offensive language deployed in some sections of the press ten years ago is now rarely used.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, in this context, I note the evidence submitted by organisations such as Mind and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rethink Mental Illness which indicates that problems remain. Recognising this, the points</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they make reflect on the press in general rather than on the PCC.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I should record that there are other instances where the efforts of the PCC in respect of pre-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication action have not been so successful. For example, the Inquiry has heard evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from Helen Belcher of Trans Media Watch, who recalled that this organisation worked with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC to try to improve press coverage of intersex and transgender people. The PCC agreed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to endorse a style guide prepared by Trans Media Watch. This was completed in February</span>

<h2>3. Independence from the industry</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A profound lack of any functional or meaningful independence from the industry that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC claimed to regulate lay at the heart of the failure of the system of self-regulation for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press. Independence operates at two levels, one of perception and the other of substance. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terms of perception, just as judges cannot in any sense be perceived as being judges in their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">own cause, or appearing to be biased or otherwise interested in the outcome, a regulator</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">must be so constituted as to satisfy every reasonable complainant that he or she will receive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a fair hearing in all respects and at all levels. In terms of substance, a regulator will not be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">free to do its job properly if tied functionally to the entities it is regulating. Further, there is a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not insubstantial risk that, if those that are being regulated take the view that they are being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">judged by fierce competitors for whom they have neither trust nor respect (even if there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is a majority of lay members of the Commission), they will not regard the discharge of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator&#8217;s duties in the correct light.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The self-regulatory system for the press, taken as a whole, is not in any way independent of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the industry. In particular, two out of the three elements of the self-regulatory structure &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PressBoF (on whom the PCC is dependent for its funding) and the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Committee &#8211; are wholly composed of serving industry figures and, in both cases, extremely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">senior industry figures. While the PCC may itself be made up of a majority of lay members,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the reasons explored below this does not make the PCC functionally independent from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the industry.</span>

<h3>Funding</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC&#8217;s funding is derived from subscriptions raised voluntarily from the industry. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">budget for the PCC is negotiated between the PCC and PressBoF and the agreed funds are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then levied from the industry. In the words of Baroness Buscombe,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;[p]ublic</span><span style="font-style:italic"> confidence</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">plainly more difficult to establish in this context<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Lord</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Grade,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span><span style="font-style:normal"> lay</span><span style="font-style:normal"> PCC</span><span style="font-style:normal"> commissioner,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> made</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the point in the following way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;the fact that PressBoF controls the purse strings leaves them in the position where</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; which they either do or they don&#8217;t abuse &#8211; I don&#8217;t have enough experience yet, but it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">leaves them in the position where they can have a huge influence on the constitution</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the running of the organisation. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s healthy.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of course, other regulators are funded solely with monies raised from the regulated industry.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One example of this is the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), which is wholly funded by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a levy raised on the advertising industry through the funding body ASBoF. The difference, as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Baroness Buscombe has made clear, is that in contrast to ASBoF, PressBoF sought to be far</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more &#8216;hands on&#8217; in relation to expenditure issues.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">I recognise that PressBoF itself robustly denies that it seeks to exercise any measure of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">control, pointing out that there have been no occasions on which a request by the PCC for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extra funding has been turned down. However, in my view this misunderstands the nature of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the relationship between the two bodies: PressBoF was the ultimate paymaster, and the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no doubt understood the difficulties inherent in asking for more.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In reality, the functional independence of the PCC was restricted by the limited resources</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which the industry supplied. Here, I am content to adopt Professor Greenslade&#8217;s analysis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which in my view fairly encapsulates the position:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;That is the reason I have often referred to the Commission being subject to &#8220;string</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pulling&#8221; by its paymasters, the Press Board of Finance (PressBoF). This has been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wrongly taken to mean that I was suggesting PressBoF members, or people acting for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">them,madeinterventionsinindividualcases.AsfarasI&#8217;maware,thatneverhappened,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and that indeed was my point: it did not need to happen. The PCC&#8217;s chairmen and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">directors could not be other than aware of the vulnerability of the Commission and of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">their own positions when attempting to hold their own paymasters to account (and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I am deliberately choosing to use a phrase borrowed from the journalistic lexicon</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about &#8220;holding power to account&#8221;). They were regulating, or seeming to regulate,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the people on whose very existence they depended.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is also clear to me that the funding made available to the PCC is barely sufficient to enable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it to conduct its complaints handling functions effectively. Further, in so limiting the funding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">available to the PCC, the organisation was unable to exercise other functions that might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be properly expected of a regulator, for example, in relation to investigations into industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conduct, and the promotion of standards. Although in submissions to the Inquiry, Lord Black</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on behalf of PressBoF has disputed that the PCC is under-funded, I recall two other important</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pieces of evidence in this regard. First, the lack of funding was characterised by Baroness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Buscombe as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> fundamental</span><span style="font-style:italic"> problem</span> &#8230;<span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> believe</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> industry</span><span style="font-style:italic"> could</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> should</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">done more to support the PCC in this regard, notwithstanding the sector&#8217;s own commercial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">pressures<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> She</span><span style="font-style:normal"> continued:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;[The PCC&#8217;s] performance runs the risk of being compromised because of lack of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">adequate funding&#8230;whilst there has been a real desire on the part of all of us at the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">PCC to raise our game, a significant lack of resource makes this frankly impossible.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The PCC functions because the 16 staff work very long hours and the current director</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">[Stephen Abell] is working and on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, as is the Head</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of Complaints and other staff members. This is simply not sustainable and is not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reasonable or sensible given the nature of our work (critical judgment calls made</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, in June 2010, at the request of PressBoF, the PCC Director Stephen Abell undertook a</span>

<a name="page1521"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">PCC remains considerably underfunded as an organisation. In the last five years, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">work of the PCC has increased significantly (in terms of formal complaints made,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">resolved, ruled upon; in the proactive work and pre-publication work undertaken by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the staff; and in the training of working journalists). Scrutiny of the PCC has also</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">increased. In the same five years, the PCC&#8217;s funding has not increased in real terms.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although I do not question Lord Black&#8217;s evidence in this regard, and Baroness Buscombe&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence does not suggest that any specific requests for additional funding were turned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">down, in my view the issue may turn on properly defining the nature and function of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body under discussion. A body with limited powers would clearly cost less to run than a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator properly so-called. I do not overlook the fact that the newspaper industry faces very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantial financial pressures and has done for some time. However, notwithstanding those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressures the industry does not give the PCC enough money to carry out the range of roles</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and functions it needs to. Beyond providing barely enough to allow the PCC to fulfil what is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commonly understood to be its primary role, namely to deal with individual complaints, as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the supposed regulator for the industry, it has been hamstrung by a critical lack of resource</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and is unable to fulfil any of the other functions which would normally be expected from a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator and which the Articles of Association permitted.</span>

<h3>Appointments &#8211; the Chair</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-10"><a href="#para3-10" name="para3-10">3.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Chair of the PCC is formally appointed by PressBoF, as has been described in Part D</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chapter 2.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-11"><a href="#para3-11" name="para3-11">3.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The appointment process has evolved over the period for which the PCC has been in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">existence. When Lord Wakeham was appointed Chair in 1995 the process was informal; he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was simply approached by the then Chair of PressBoF, Sir Harry Roche, and his shoulder was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">metaphorically tapped.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup> For the appointment of Lord Hunt, as more fully discussed below,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an independent assessor was involved in the process, as well as involvement by some of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lay members.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-12"><a href="#para3-12" name="para3-12">3.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Wakeham identified a number of reasons why he believed that he was considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate for the role of Chair of the PCC, chief among them being that the self-regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system was at that point under considerable pressure and the press wanted a candidate who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could safeguard that system from what it regarded as the threat of statute:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think the newspaper industry did not want statutory control and that they accepted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they needed someone to be the chairman with a bit of clout, who could stop statutory</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">control by getting the standards up to an acceptable level...They wanted someone on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">side with the government because they did not want statutory regulation.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-13"><a href="#para3-13" name="para3-13">3.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Wakeham also said that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> regarded</span><span style="font-style:italic"> as</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> strong</span><span style="font-style:italic"> supporter</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> press</span><span style="font-style:italic"> freedom</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> self</span></span>

<a name="page1522"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">he regarded it as a pre-requisite of anyone being involved in the PCC that he or she should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">committed to both these principles.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup> This evidence was as frank as it was unsurprising. In this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regard, Lord Wakeham did not buck the trend, nor did any of his successors.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-14"><a href="#para3-14" name="para3-14">3.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The appointments process has since become more formalised. However, applicants for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">post of Chair of the PCC are still required to have broadly similar qualities to those which led</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Lord Wakeham being approached. Both Sir Christopher Meyer and Baroness Buscombe</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were asked in their appointment interviews whether they were supporters of press freedom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and believers in self-regulation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup> Indeed, Sir Christopher went to some lengths to make clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his support for the principle of press self-regulation on a number of occasions. In a speech</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">delivered at the beginning of his tenure as the Chair of the PCC, Sir Christopher said that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Liberty and self regulation are inextricably linked. Any infringement of self regulation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would not just erode the freedoms of the press. Far more importantly it would curtail</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the freedoms of the citizen, who in a democratic society will always depend on media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">uninhibited by both control of the state and deference to the establishment to protect</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">their liberty. That is why self regulation &#8211; and all the jagged edges that come with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it &#8211; must be protected, must be nurtured, and must grow.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Christopher maintained the same view in evidence given to the Inquiry. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;is self-regulation the only way consistent with maintaining freedom of expression</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the press&#8217; status as an exponent of that? The short answer is: yes.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-15"><a href="#para3-15" name="para3-15">3.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In maintaining his position in this way, Sir Christopher appears to be adopting what I consider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be a somewhat remarkable position. First, the equation between liberty and self-regulation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8211; almost as a philosophical position &#8211; is in my view simplistic and capable of being overly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">alarmist. I have explained why this is so in Part B above, and in Part K Chapter 7 below.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, and perhaps in this context more significantly, these public statements extolling the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">virtues of self-regulation (coupled in Sir Christopher&#8217;s case with equating self-regulation by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC with regulation properly so-called) certainly created the impression that the Chair</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the industry itself were speaking with one voice on an issue on which they had identical,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strong views. It also created the impression that the status quo in what might be called &#8216;very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">light&#8217; regulation was acceptable, and that anything else was not. Ultimately, these amounted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the expression of political judgments which might have left complainants asking the not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impertinent question: what about the private rights of the individual?</span>

<p id="para-id-3-16"><a href="#para3-16" name="para3-16">3.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Hunt was appointed to Chair of the PCC in October 2011, in succession to Baroness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Buscombe who had resigned in July that year. The advertisement for the post had stated that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the successful applicant had to be committed to the principles of freedom of the press and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of self-regulation,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup> and he confirmed that he was wedded to those principles, and explained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">why. Lord Hunt also confirmed that Lord Wakeham had had some role in persuading him to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the process.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-17"><a href="#para3-17" name="para3-17">3.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Exactly what happened is somewhat opaque. Despite an on-going process of reform, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appointment process appears to be neither transparent nor impartial. Whilst it is not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unexpected that candidates might be canvassed as to their views on self-regulation and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expected to support the principles of self-regulation, at the very least the appointments</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">process risked giving rise to the perception that the Chair was beholden to the regulated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry. Further, it is clear that Lord Hunt is the last in a line of PCC Chairs who appears to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have regarded freedom of the press, particularly as defined in the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and self-regulation, as synonymous.</span>
<h3>Appointment of other members of the PCC</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-18"><a href="#para3-18" name="para3-18">3.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lay members of the PCC are also required to be committed to the principles of self-regulation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the freedom of the press. This appears also to have meant that, above all else, they too</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be supportive of the idea of freedom of expression or press freedom as set out in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref38" href="#footnote38">38</a></sup> In his interview to become a PCC Commissioner Lord Grade</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recalled that he was asked whether or not he supported statutory regulation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref39" href="#footnote39">39</a></sup> However, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has recently been pointed out by His Honour Jeremy Roberts QC (formerly a distinguished</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal judge) and others that the Inquiry may have received an unbalanced perspective on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this point. For example, he recalls that Mr Abell asked him a question at his interview about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the balance between Article 8 and Article 10 rights, and Lord Grade now recalls that he was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also asked a similar question.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-19"><a href="#para3-19" name="para3-19">3.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whilst acknowledging this point, it is, however, clear that, an<span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> priori</span> commitment to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principles of self-regulation amounted in practice to a commitment to the system of self-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation through the PCC. Having heard some evidence as to the very different individuals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who comprise the lay members of the PCC (which I touch on below), it is nevertheless clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that those individuals were all recruited from a narrow class of people already committed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the principle of self-regulation by the industry and, effectively, in the form that it existed, that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is to say, to the preservation of the status quo.</span>

<h3>Serving editors on the PCC</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-20"><a href="#para3-20" name="para3-20">3.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Newspaper editors currently in post serve on the PCC, albeit as a minority. This raises at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very least the appearance of bias, creating the concern that the industry was &#8216;marking its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">own homework&#8217;. While editors do not take part in discussions on complaints relating to their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">own newspapers, or newspapers from the same group, they have and may be seen to have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a commonality of interests in directing the overall analysis of the balance between freedom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to publish and the rights of third parties in a manner which might overly protect the former</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">over the latter and may not place sufficient restrictions on press behaviour, or at least create</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the perception of so doing.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">It has been suggested that, since editors are in a minority on the PCC, their presence does not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in fact threaten the independence of PCC decision-making.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup> I record that this suggestion was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also reinforced in the submission received from His Honour Jeremy Roberts QC, supported</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the evidence of his lay commissioner colleagues. I understand and respect the points that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been made, and return to them below, and should not be interpreted as saying that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual lay commissioners have failed in their duty. Rather, the stand out issue is about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">systems and independence of decision-making viewed in the round.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-22"><a href="#para3-22" name="para3-22">3.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On that basis alone, I am unable to accept this argument for a number of reasons. First,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">even if not a majority, the editors formed a substantial bloc within the PCC who, by dint</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of their experience and practical knowledge of the industry, would be likely to exercise a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disproportionate influence. Even if that is not so, at the very least, this would be how</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasonable observers would view the matter. These influences would undeniably be mitigated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if the industry had chosen to populate the PCC with more former editors, serving journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and NUJ members, likely to inject a more independent-minded approach. Instead, expert</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry knowledge was concentrated in the hands of editors only.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-23"><a href="#para3-23" name="para3-23">3.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, the PCC operates a principle of abiding by precedent, looking to previous decisions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for guidance when deciding cases and seeking to keep decisions consistent.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup> Key decisions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are collated in the Editors&#8217; Codebook, an amplified version of the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A decision in one case would determine or at least influence the approach taken by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC in a similar case in future.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup> Although unexceptional when viewed in isolation from all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other considerations, this state of affairs far from eliminates the conflict of interest which is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acknowledged by editors leaving the room when their own newspaper or a sister paper is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being discussed. An awareness that an adjudication in the instant case might well impact on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the application of the Code to a future case, in which the adjudicating editor&#8217;s own title might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be involved, creates an inherent conflict between the interests of serving editors and doing of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">full justice to the complaint and the person who made it.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-24"><a href="#para3-24" name="para3-24">3.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is not a practice shared by other regulators and with good reason. Ofcom, charged with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the different but (for these purposes) comparable task of regulating the broadcast media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry, does not have anyone currently active in the industry on the board which adjudicates</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on breaches of the Broadcasting Code. The Chair of Ofcom, Dr Collette Bowe, described the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">structure of Ofcom in the following way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">broadcasting is himself a well-known, very distinguished broadcast journalist,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">formerly of the BBC and then of Channel 4, who brings a large amount of experience</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to that role, but we do not regard it as appropriate to have people who are engaged</span>

<a name="page1525"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">DR BOWE: Because of conflicts. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with the sorts of issues</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">I recognise that PCC witnesses gave evidence (which I entirely accept) that the lay or public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">members of the PCC are independently-minded, often strong-willed individuals who are not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intimidated by the presence of editors:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;IthinkifyoulookatthelistofpeoplewhoservedontheCommission,it&#8217;sanimpressive</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in their field in one way or another. These aren&#8217;t patsies at all. Obviously, I was in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">every single Commission meeting whilst I was director and there would be some</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">excellent knock-about debates. So these weren&#8217;t people who were in any way cowed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by the presence of a few editors.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-26"><a href="#para3-26" name="para3-26">3.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Grade was also asked for his perspective on this point. His answer should be set out in</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">full.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve never experienced that. I must have attended now eight or nine meetings. Where</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a case is going against a newspaper, where the recommendation of the officers is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that there&#8217;s been a clear breach of the code &#8211; such-and-such a clause in the code,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the editorial figures on the board, who are in a minority, are the first to speak out</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in condemnation and say, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe they did that, that was a &#8211;&#8221; you know, it&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a very, very honest debate. A very, very honest debate. Anybody with an interest,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">obviously, leaves the room at that point, if they&#8217;re part of a group and it&#8217;s one of their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapers in the group, whether it&#8217;s a local newspaper or national newspaper. No,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the debates are very, very, very fair. There are debates about the wording and quite</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">often &#8211; I can&#8217;t think of an example at the moment because we get papers that thick</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">every week (indicates). There are examples where editorial figures around that table</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have strengthened the criticism in the adjudication. So I don&#8217;t have any issue in that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regard whatsoever, and I wouldn&#8217;t &#8211; personally speaking, I wouldn&#8217;t be there if that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was the case. I wouldn&#8217;t stay there if that was the case.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-27"><a href="#para3-27" name="para3-27">3.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I also expressly record that Tim Toulmin rejected the criticism that there were no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">representatives of the victims of press intrusion on the PCC, saying that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> people</span><span style="font-style:italic"> who</span><span style="font-style:italic"> work</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at the PCC, whether they&#8217;re on the board or full time staff, are motivated by trying to assist</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people who are having difficulties with the press, particularly those vulnerable people who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">can&#8217;t afford a lawyer and so on.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-28"><a href="#para3-28" name="para3-28">3.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It may well be unnecessary, if not inappropriate, to ensure that one or more lay Commissioners</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should have had experience of having suffered at the hands of press intrusion, since</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals in this category might be expected to be biased the other way, or at least give rise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to that appearance.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup> Even so, without doubting the truth of Lord Grade&#8217;s evidence as to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">full and frank exchange of views which attends the deliberations on the PCC&#8217;s adjudications</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in individual cases, I do not believe that it really addresses the structural problems I have</span>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref47" name="footnote47" title="Go back to footnote reference 47 in the text">47</a>.  I acknowledge that three of the lay commissioners have recently submitted evidence that they or their families hadin the past been the subject of press attention. However, there has been no suggestion that they were the subject ofthe kind of intrusive reporting which has proved most damaging to victims; and which the PCC failed to tackle</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1526"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">identified. Lord Grade&#8217;s evidence would fail to persuade those who reasonably believe that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the system is inherently weighted in favour of the status quo. Neither is this point to doubt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the real value that I am sure lay Commissioners have brought to the process.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-29"><a href="#para3-29" name="para3-29">3.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Refreshingly, some representatives of the press have accepted that the presence of serving</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editors on the PCC compromises its independence. For example, the editor of the<span style="font-style:italic"> Financial</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">serving editors:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not a tenable position. We need outsiders. There have been some changes, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">certainly for too long the PCC was dominated by insiders.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-30"><a href="#para3-30" name="para3-30">3.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am not suggesting for one moment that the PCC should have been free from all industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expertise: on the contrary, this always would have been, and is, invaluable. But industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expertise should have been drawn from a broader cohort and should not have been taken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from serving editors of large national titles in competition with other national titles at all.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref49" href="#footnote49">49</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have already said that serving or former journalists (including NUJ members) and retired</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editors would add a different perspective to the PCC board.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-31"><a href="#para3-31" name="para3-31">3.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I do not accept the argument that retired editors would necessarily be out of touch with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">developments in the industry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">51</a></sup> The broadcast media industry has, over the past 20 years,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">changed with extraordinary speed. The rise of the internet and media convergence has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impacted upon broadcasters as well as newspapers. In spite of this, Ofcom has successfully</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">employed the expertise of former journalists and media executives on its Board.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref52" href="#footnote52">52</a></sup> There is no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggestion that those people have failed to understand or account for the acute changes and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">associated challenges which have affected the broadcast media. I emphasise that this is not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to seek to compare the PCC with Ofcom or to hold one up against the other: it is simply to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">make the point that similar issues fall to be considered without the absence of serving editors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being considered a disadvantage, still less an impediment.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-32"><a href="#para3-32" name="para3-32">3.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In my view, the constitution of the PCC Board is a limit on its independence. Serving editors,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">however dedicated to their role, are<span style="font-style:italic"> parti</span><span style="font-style:italic"> pris</span> in relation to the outcome of adjudications in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the sense I have identified, and are capable of influencing both the agenda and the course of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">debateinindividualinstances.Additionally,butoutside thecontextofindividualadjudications,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the system is such that it creates at least the perception that the most powerful individuals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the PCC will direct overall strategy, policy and direction. Alastair Campbell put the point</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup></span>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref49" name="footnote49" title="Go back to footnote reference 49 in the text">49</a>.  The example is often given of doctors serving on Disciplinary Committees of the General Medical Council. If an<span style="font-size: 12px;"> ENTsurgeon from, say, Newcastle, sits on a Disciplinary Committee in respect of an ENT surgeon whom he does not knowand has had no contact with from, say, London, he will be able to bring his expertise to bear in a completely impartialway. If one of a dozen or so national editors sits on a PCC panel in relation to a competitive title, it is almost inevitablethat he or she will know the editor extremely well and is likely to have a view about the balance of Articles 8 and 10:a complainant may well not feel that such an editor could be entirely impartial. As appears from the analysis of theposition of Northern and Shell, the converse might also be true</span></p><!--footnote-->

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people who &#8217;counted&#8217; there were the chairman, Les Hinton and Paul Dacre.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">statement admittedly did not identify. Whether or not they were speaking authoritatively, or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accurately, perhaps does not matter; the concern is the perception which arises from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">possibility for real power to be concentrated in a few hands.</span>

<h3>The makeup of the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice Committee</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-34"><a href="#para3-34" name="para3-34">3.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Editors&#8217; Code of Practice Committee, formally a sub-Committee of PressBoF rather than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the PCC, is responsible for the promulgation of the terms of the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice. A</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">list of the current members of the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice Committee is given in the witness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statement of Stephen Abell.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref54" href="#footnote54">54</a></sup> It wholly comprises serving editors and executives.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-35"><a href="#para3-35" name="para3-35">3.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC has been able to communicate its views on any amendments to the Editors&#8217; Code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Practice, through the Chair or the Director. Although the formal role of the PCC Chair and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioners in relation to the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice is advisory only, it has in practice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been persuasive. One occasion when views were communicated was in the aftermath of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">death of Diana, Princess of Wales. Lord Wakeham gave evidence that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref55" href="#footnote55">55</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I persuaded the newspaper industry to strengthen its Code of Practice several times,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">including a wholesale revision, particularly on matters relating to privacy, following</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the death of the Princess of Wales in 1997.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-36"><a href="#para3-36" name="para3-36">3.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has also heard evidence that the PCC itself (through the Director or the Chair) was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involved in feeding back ideas for improvements to the Editors&#8217; Code from the coalface to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Editors&#8217; Code Committee. There are examples of this in the documentation which the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has provided to the Inquiry. One such is a letter from Sir Christopher Meyer to Les Hinton,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then Chairman of the Editors&#8217; Code Committee, recommending improvements to clause 6</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Editors&#8217; Code.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref56" href="#footnote56">56</a></sup> On other occasions, comments on the Editors&#8217; Code from external</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contributors were fed into the Editors&#8217; Code Committee&#8217;s considerations.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref57" href="#footnote57">57</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-37"><a href="#para3-37" name="para3-37">3.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Public involvement in the contents of the Editors&#8217; Code was, however, more limited and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">restricted to an annual consultation session undertaken by the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Committee. Beyond this and the limited role of the PCC, control over the Code was held</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">entirely by the editors serving on the Code Committee.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-38"><a href="#para3-38" name="para3-38">3.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In contrast, although a statutory code (which I do not recommend) as a matter of pure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">structure, it is significant that the Broadcasting Code is drafted by Ofcom employees and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approvedbytheContentBoard,underdelegatedauthorityfromtheOfcomBoard.Suggestions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are fed into Ofcom by stakeholders in the industry so that the Broadcasting Code develops in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consultation with the industry and accounts for changing practices and industry challenges.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ed Richards, the Chief Executive of Ofcom, described the development of the Broadcasting</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Code in the following way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref58" href="#footnote58">58</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it would then go through our decision-making process for approval, and in this case</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would be approved by our content board, which is where the hub of our broadcasting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expertise lies. It could always, as with any Ofcom decision, be then referred upwards</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the main board, but as I recall, I think this [current edition] would have been signed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">off by the content board in their delegated responsibilities.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">DR BOWE: Yes.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Have you found it necessary &#8230; to involve actual programme</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">makers or editors in the creation of this document?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">MR RICHARDS: I would say that they are involved very closely in its evolution. We have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a very close dialogue with actual programme makers, actual journalists, currently</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">practising but also those for whom we can &#8211;those who we can draw on who are no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">longer practising but still have a deep well of expertise, and we draw on that very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">heavily. So just to underline the point, what does not happen is that half a dozen</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people in Ofcom hide in a room and write a code. What actually happens is that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">those people talk on an open way over an extended period, test ideas, examine them,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">review them, and that process would involve working journalists, working producers,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">working editors, as well as those of &#8211; with previous experience, but the decision on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the code would then be ours, and the decision would be made by the content board,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">so it&#8217;s incorporating, understanding latest practice and things of that nature, but the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decision absolutely remains with us.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-39"><a href="#para3-39" name="para3-39">3.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is a clear flaw in the self-regulatory system that the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice Committee,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the body with sole authority to amend the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice, is made up exclusively</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of serving editors and executives. This gives rise to at least the perception that rules are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being made which suit the editors themselves and not the public. Of course, as Mr Richards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pointed out, a deep well of expertise is obviously necessary but what is also required is the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involvement of a broader range of opinion to reflect all relevant constituencies.</span>

<h3>Evidence of Northern and Shell witnesses</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-40"><a href="#para3-40" name="para3-40">3.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Witnesses from Northern & Shell gave evidence of their impression that the PCC was run by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and for the benefit of a particular section of the press; this they gave as the principal reason</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the January 2011 departure:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;we came into it seeing the sense in a self-regulated press, and we thought to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ourselves we were able to regulate ourselves. There are a very large number of very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">good reasons why a newspaper would want to regulate itself, even without any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">industry body. We&#8217;d been used to doing that on magazines, so we knew of an Editors&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Code, and we saw no reason, in principle, why a company in isolation might not apply</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that Editors&#8217; Code and put in its own disciplines and constraints.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The difference was the same code was being enforced, but it was a kind of an industry</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">body that &#8211; it was a club.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-41"><a href="#para3-41" name="para3-41">3.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Underlying this answer may be both an element of special pleading and of personal acrimony</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between those at the head of Northern & Shell and those who they perceive as running</span>

<a name="page1529"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">this &#8216;club&#8217;. From their perspective, the PCC was too close to one or more sections of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press, and Northern & Shell was relegated to the sidelines. I would not wish to comment on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether this perception articulated by Paul Ashford is substantiated, but its very existence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">does bear on the general issue of independence, the lack of which, and in particular from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">certain sections of the press, was also the reason given by Ian Hislop for Private Eye&#8217;s refusal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to join the system of self-regulation in the first place.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup></span>

<a name="section4"></a>
<h2>4. The alignment with industry</h2>

<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In this section I look at the willingness of the Press Complaints Commission, as putative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator, to align its interests directly with those of the industry. At times, it seems that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC acted as both advocate and champion for this industry, a role that it rarely adopted in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to those who had been wronged by the press. I will also examine and comment on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the response of the PCC in response to criticism and its attitude towards the improvement of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its structures and functions as well as calls from outside the industry for reform.</span>

<h3>Advocacy of press industry interests</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On occasion, the PCC acted as an unabashed advocate or lobbyist for the press industry. Some</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of this advocacy was directly in the commercial interests of the press. On other occasions,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC advanced the case for the self-regulatory system itself. Promoting self-regulation in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principle, and the self-regulatory system as it was established in practice, may have created</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">less obvious difficulties of perception than the promotion of the commercial interests of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulated industry. However, as the preservation of the<span style="font-style:italic"> status</span><span style="font-style:italic"> quo</span> was in at least the short</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">term interests of the industry, promotion of the merits of self-regulation was an advancement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of that interest. In my view, this served to create a real conflict of interest between the core</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">function of the PCC, applying the Code and achieving a balance between the interests of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subjects of stories and the press, and the role it arrogated to itself in advocating the interests</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the industry as a whole.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As has been make clear in earlier sections of the Report, in particular Part I Chapter 5 section</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">3, Lord Wakeham intervened to influence the content of the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA),</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">negotiating with the then Home Secretary the Rt Hon Jack Straw MP for the inclusion of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">section 12 in aid of the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref61" href="#footnote61">61</a></sup> Lord Wakeham was clear in his evidence that he<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;never</span></span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Wakeham outlined his reservations about the effect of the Human Rights Bill on the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in two speeches to the House of Lords. He set out his concern in a speech on 24 November</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1997 thus:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref66" href="#footnote66">66</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Bill as drafted would damage the freedom of the press and badly wound the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">system of tough and effective self regulation that we have built up to provide quick</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">remedies without cost for ordinary citizens. It would inevitably produce a privacy law,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">despite the Government&#8217;s stated opposition to one&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Rt Hon Tony Blair gave evidence to the Inquiry of the lobbying undertaken by Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Wakeham and the PCC more broadly intended to make plain the detrimental impact of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">HRA on the press:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref67" href="#footnote67">67</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. &#8230;The Human Rights Act, Mr Blair&#8230;Was it the position that News International &#8211; I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">suppose together with everybody else &#8211; were lobbying for complete press immunity</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from the Human Rights Act?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes, that&#8217;s right. They wanted no suggestion that you would move outside the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">bounds of the PCC and self-regulation.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. And were you generally supportive of that position?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes, that was &#8230; my view was that if you were to deal with this, you had to deal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with it head on, as it were, not through the Human Rights Act, which would be a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sort of side way of dealing with it. Also, at that time, I think I&#8217;m right in saying it was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Lord Wakeham who was head of the PCC, who was something actually I thought was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">doing quite a good job of that, and the PCC were pretty fierce on this, on behalf the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whole of the media, really, not any one particular part of it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-6"><a href="#para4-6" name="para4-6">4.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Initially, this lobbying was intended to convince the Government to grant the press an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exemption from the HRA.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref68" href="#footnote68">68</a></sup> The Government was, however, according to Lord Smith of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finsbury,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;fundamentally</span><span style="font-style:italic"> opposed</span> &#8221; to any such exemption.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref69" href="#footnote69">69</a></sup> In the event, the solution,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">negotiated by Lord Wakeham,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref70" href="#footnote70">70</a></sup> between the press and the Government was described by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Smith thus:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref71" href="#footnote71">71</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In June of 1998, agreement was reached across government &#8211; and welcomed by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the PCC &#8211; that a new clause would be brought forward for the Human Rights Bill:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">giving a steer on the need to respect the media&#8217;s right to freedom of expression as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">well as individuals&#8217; rights to privacy; requiring the courts to have regard to the PCC</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Code of Practice and the broadcasting codes; and making it more difficult to obtain</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">injunctions restraining publication&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The compromise reached was the insertion of what was to become section 12 HRA. Lord</span>

<p id="para-id-4-8"><a href="#para4-8" name="para4-8">4.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Human Rights Bill was not the only contemporaneous legislative matter to alarm the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry. Proposals in the Data Protection Bill were also a cause for concern. Lord Wakeham</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">linked the two in a speech:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref73" href="#footnote73">73</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The thing that puzzles me is that the Data Protection Bill and the Human Rights Bill</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which this House has been considering seem to exist almost in different worlds, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the truth is that they present two entirely contradictory sets of policies. The data</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">protection bill does not introduce new powers for the rich and famous; the human</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rights bill does the opposite. The data protection bill does not introduce a back door</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">privacy regime; the human rights bill does. The data protection bill safeguards the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">position of self-regulation. The human rights bill may end up undermining it.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the interests of the press and the interests of self-regulation. I have no doubt that Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Wakeham, in lobbying the Home Secretary and other Ministers, believed that he was working</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the interests of the self-regulatory system. However, Lord Wakeham&#8217;s interventions were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">couched not only in terms of protecting self-regulatory structures but also included warnings</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the danger to the freedom of the press.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-10"><a href="#para4-10" name="para4-10">4.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Wakeham was not by any means the only leading member of the PCC to have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adept at the lobbying and influencing of politicians. When Guy (now Lord) Black resigned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as Director of the PCC, Sir Christopher Meyer praised him for his skill in helping to influence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government policy in the interests of the self-regulatory system. In particular, Sir Christopher</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made reference to the role played by Lord Black in mitigating the impact of a number of pieces</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of legislation and for helping secure a benign political environment for self-regulation:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref74" href="#footnote74">74</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Since 1996 he has helped protect self regulation from the threats posed by numerous</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pieces of legislation including the Human Rights, Data Protection and Youth Justice</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Acts. And by making the PCC the efficient and effective body that it is today, Guy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">can rightly claim credit for the generally benevolent political attitude towards self-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regulation that we currently enjoy&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-11"><a href="#para4-11" name="para4-11">4.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC actively sought to combat what it perceived as threats to the self-regulatory system.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The 2003 Annual Report of the PCC set out the &#8216;external threats&#8217; facing the Commission.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These included: discussions with European officials &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> protect</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> special</span><span style="font-style:italic"> position</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> self-</span></span>

<p id="para-id-4-12"><a href="#para4-12" name="para4-12">4.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In 2005, the PCC coordinated with PressBoF to lobby in Europe against the effect of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposed Television Without Frontiers Directive. The then Director of the PCC, Tim Toulmin,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wrote to the Secretary of PressBoF in the following terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref79" href="#footnote79">79</a></sup></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;My understanding is that the specific danger in the draft Directive is in its expectation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that there will be regulations to ensure that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 15px;"> there</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> is</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> a</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> (statutory)</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> right</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> of</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> reply</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> to</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> inaccuracies;</span></span></li>

<li><span style="font-size: 15px;"> audio-visual</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> material</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> is</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> not</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> distributed</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> in</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> such</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> a</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> way</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> that</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> might</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> seriously</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors; and</span></li>

<li><span style="font-size: 15px;"> audio-visual</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> information</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> does</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> not</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> contain</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> incitement</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> to</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> hatred</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> on</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> the</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> grounds</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">orientation. &#8220;Incitement to hatred&#8221; is not defined.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">These areas clearly touch on editorial content, particularly the first and third points,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but the consultation papers only suggest explicitly that the second of these could</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be dealt with through self-regulation. Worryingly, the relevant paper states that in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relation to the proposed rules on discrimination, &#8220;some stakeholders argued that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">co-regulation or self-regulation would be inappropriate&#8221;, and there is no further</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">suggestion that self-regulation would be adequate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The broader danger, of course, is that unless these areas are carved out for self-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regulation, the Directive will effectively have been a Trojan horse, with the regulation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of at least some part of newspapers&#8217; and magazines&#8217; websites becoming for the first</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">time the responsibility of other agencies (probably Ofcom). It can only be a matter</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of time before this precedent is used to argue for the harmonisation of regulation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of broadcasters&#8217; and publishers&#8217; websites as media convergence continues. Ofcom,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">incidentally, assures us that it has no &#8216;imperial&#8217; ambitions in this area, and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">government appears to have taken a strong position against having to regulate the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">editorial content of websites &#8211; although it may of course have no choice eventually.</span></p>

<p id="para-id-4-13"><a href="#para4-13" name="para4-13">4.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Toulmin&#8217;s letter is instructive. It is clear that the PCC was working with PressBoF to try to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">combat a perceived threat not only to the self-regulatory system but also more significantly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to editorial freedom. It demonstrates that the PCC sought to influence legislation in a way</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which favoured the interests of the industry.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-14"><a href="#para4-14" name="para4-14">4.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC adopted a similar advocatory role in relation to discussions concerning the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">introduction of custodial sentences for breach of s55 of the Data Protection Act. On this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occasion, it was Sir Christopher Meyer who would play the lead role. Sir Christopher gave</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence that he could not recall any conversations with editors or other representatives of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press industry about the issue.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref80" href="#footnote80">80</a></sup> However, he said that he thought it was appropriate for</span>

<a name="page1533"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It was something I believed in, and if you think Mr Dacre picked up the phone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">one day and said&#8230;&#8220;Very helpful if you stick in the annual review something about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Section 55&#8221; &#8211; forget it. Even Jack Straw was on his side as well &#8230; and the Information</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Commissioner was rebuffed by the Lord Chancellor.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So it was not as if I was expressing some astonishing view. There was very wide public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">debate about this, and we decided to take part in it and why the hell not?&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-15"><a href="#para4-15" name="para4-15">4.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whether or not there were conversations between Sir Christopher and representatives of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press industry about the issue of custodial sentences for breach of s55 of the Data Protection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Act, his action in respect of this issue on behalf of the organisation he chaired demonstrates</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that PCC thinking and priorities were very close (if not identical) to those of the industry it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">supposed to regulate. Little consideration appears to have been given to those who might be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the subject of intrusive breaches of data protection at the hands of the press without there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being the slightest public interest in such breaches. Yet it is the complaints of those people</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which the PCC exists to mediate or resolve.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-16"><a href="#para4-16" name="para4-16">4.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not clear to me why the PCC thought it either necessary or appropriate to lobby</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Government on behalf of the press; it is not as if the press was devoid of its own powerful</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advocates. It is apparent from Sir Christopher&#8217;s evidence that the impulse to intervene</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stemmed from a prior belief that the principle of press freedom was at stake; and that this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">principle was something the PCC had a role in defending. I do not question the genuineness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Sir Christopher&#8217;s belief, although I have raised elsewhere my concerns as to whether it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">well-founded. The point remains that in picking up the proverbial megaphone in this way, Sir</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Christopher was in danger of undermining public confidence in the ability or willingness of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC to act as an impartial and independent regulator through the clear alignment of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC with the interests of the industry.</span>

<h3>Protective function of the PCC</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-17"><a href="#para4-17" name="para4-17">4.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There appears to have been a belief among some sections of the press that one of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">functions of the PCC was to act as a shield protecting the press from criticism and litigation.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The former editor of the Daily Express, Peter Hill, assigned as one of the main reasons for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Northern & Shell&#8217;s decision to leave the PCC as the fact that the latter no longer prevented</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complainants from claiming through the courts.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-18"><a href="#para4-18" name="para4-18">4.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In 2009, Sir Christopher Meyer wrote to Richard Desmond in an attempt to persuade the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Northern and Shell group to remain in the self-regulatory system. He wrote:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref83" href="#footnote83">83</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;now that the Express has withdrawn from the NPA, it would be helpful to talk</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about how we can keep the papers within the PCC system. The benefits to newspapers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of subscribing to the scheme are numerous: sorting out complaints through us</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(particularly about privacy matters) minimises the risk of cripplingly expensive</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">court cases and legal settlements; it delivers opt-outs for journalists from numerous</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pieces of legislation such as the Investment Recommendation Regulations; and it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">keeps the government from legislating on the areas that the press Code of Practice</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">covers. In fact, last year &#8211; when the public used our services in record numbers &#8211; the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Government, Opposition and the Select Committee for Culture, Media and Sport all</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">came out in favour of self-regulation. I know that the subscription to the PCC is not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cheap &#8211; around &#163;167k per annum &#8211; but I strongly believe that the costs of staying</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">outside the system, particularly in legal fees, would be much higher.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In a similar vein, the 2010 financial review (drafted by the then Director of the PCC, Stephen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Abell) made the following observation:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref84" href="#footnote84">84</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A successful PCC is, as everyone recognises, in the interests of the industry, both in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">terms of staving off statutory regulation and limiting the flow of people to use the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">courts. The better the service the PCC can offer, the better value it is to the industry.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-20"><a href="#para4-20" name="para4-20">4.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Themaintenanceofthesystemofself-regulationthroughthePCCand,thereforebyimplication,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ability of the PCC to shield the industry from litigation, was often cited by the PCC as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a reason for newspapers to comply with PCC adjudications and decisions. Sir Christopher</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wrote in February 2007 to Colin Myler, then the editor of the NoTW, to arraign Mr Myler</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for not having given sufficient prominence to a PCC adjudication. Sir Christopher wrote: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> I</span></span>

<h3>A pattern of cosmetic reform</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-21"><a href="#para4-21" name="para4-21">4.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In other parts of this Report, most particularly in Part D Chapter 1, I fully address the history</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of press self-regulation. As I said on several occasions during the oral sessions this has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">characterised by a cyclical pattern of (i) crisis, (ii) the press coming under heavy public and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some political pressure, (iii) some reforms, usually of a limited nature, being carried out, (iv)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ephemeral improvement, (v) deterioration in press behaviour, and ultimately (vi) another</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">crisis. As I made clear above,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref86" href="#footnote86">86</a></sup> the reforms introduced by the industry have not addressed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the structural problems which this Part of the Report serves to identify. Put another way,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">limited programmes of reform have been concerned with relieving pressure on the press, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">blunting calls for strengthening the self-regulatory system. A show of reform has been used</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a substitute for the reality of it.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-22"><a href="#para4-22" name="para4-22">4.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Part D Chapter 1 looked at the history of self-regulation until 2003 which was when Sir</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Christopher Meyer took over as Chair of the PCC. I will therefore pick up the narrative from</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">then.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-23"><a href="#para4-23" name="para4-23">4.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In a speech delivered on 6 May 2003, approximately six weeks into his tenure as Chair,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Christopher announced a programme of reform which he described as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> permanent</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first measures introduced as part of the &#8216;permanent evolution&#8217; programme related to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independence of the Commission itself. The number of public members of the Commission</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was increased to ten (from nine) against seven editorial members.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref89" href="#footnote89">89</a></sup> Also, the recruitment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">process for public members was changed so that positions were advertised, and prospective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">members were interviewed by an independent panel before the final interview with Sir</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Christopher and another member of the PCC.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">As I noted earlier, the fact that lay members formed a majority on the Commission has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">repeatedly relied upon by the PCC and its supporters as evidence of the independence of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">self-regulatory system from the industry. Putting one more lay member on the Commission</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appears to be a step towards achieving greater independence for the decision-making body,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but it was far from being a radical one; the positive impact, if any, is far from clear. This was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very much more a cosmetic move towards independence than a substantive one.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The programme of &#8216;permanent evolution&#8217; also saw the introduction of the Charter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner and the Charter Compliance panel. In the PCC&#8217;s 2004 Annual Report, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">role of the Charter Commissioner was described as providing &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> an</span><span style="font-style:italic"> internal</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;judicial</span><span style="font-style:italic"> review&#8217;</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">examine whether decisions of the PCC were reasonable, even in the rather more limited sense</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">permitted by judicial review. Rather, they examined whether the PCC&#8217;s service standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">met their targets; if the review found a procedural defect, it could ask the PCC to revisit a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref91" href="#footnote91">91</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-27"><a href="#para4-27" name="para4-27">4.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">What these two bodies offered was effectively an enhanced customer-service complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body and nothing more. To imply, by describing the powers of the Charter Commissioner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Charter Compliance Panel in the language of judicial review, that they had any more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantial function, or offered the reassurance of oversight of the PCC&#8217;s activities, is entirely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wrong; they were little more than window-dressing.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref92" href="#footnote92">92</a></sup> Taken as a whole, the package of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reforms introduced under Sir Christopher&#8217;s &#8216;permanent evolution&#8217; did not address, and were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not intended to address, the substantive problems with the system of self-regulation. These</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">limited reforms may well have given the appearance of activity and development but did little</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more than that.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-28"><a href="#para4-28" name="para4-28">4.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nor did the PCC move to address in any meaningful sense the concerns raised by revelations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of mobile phone voicemail hacking by journalists working at the NoTW in 2006. Following</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the completion of the PCC&#8217;s Report into Subterfuge and Newsgathering in May 2007 (dealt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with in more detail below), the PCC made recommendations to newspapers about steps</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they might take in order to comply with the existing rules in relation to data protection,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subterfuge and news gathering.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref93" href="#footnote93">93</a></sup> In August 2007, Clause 10 of the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(relating to subterfuge and newsgathering) was revised to prohibit the unauthorised removal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of documents or photographs and the accessing of digitally-held private information without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consent. In addition, Clause 10(ii) was changed so that the provisions in relation to public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest justifications for subterfuge and misrepresentations extended to the activities of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the governance review which followed was altogether more limited in its scope:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref96" href="#footnote96">96</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;the industry was very clear that a review undertaken by the PCC should only</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consider issues solely within its remit. Questions as to funding, independence and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sanctions were decidedly off limits&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-30"><a href="#para4-30" name="para4-30">4.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Independent Governance Review made 75 separate recommendations. According to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Stephen Abell, former Director of the PCC, the key reforms which eventuated principally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">comprised:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref97" href="#footnote97">97</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A proper statement of aims and duties were to be published by the PCC;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">An enhanced register of interests would be published to inform the public of any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">conflicts of interest which Commissioners might have;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A public commissioner would be appointed Deputy Chairman of the PCC;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">New performance objectives would be introduced to measure the success of the PCC&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">work;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A new website would be launched to improve access to complaint statistics, PCC case</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">law and complaint-making facilities;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Commissioners would be updated weekly on the day-to-day activities of the PCC&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">staff; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The PCC would establish working groups to consider questions arising from public</span>

<p id="para-id-4-31"><a href="#para4-31" name="para4-31">4.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Other recommendations included changing the name of the Charter Commissioner and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Charter Compliance Panel to the Independent Reviewer and Review Panel respectively.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref98" href="#footnote98">98</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">None of these changes addressed the fundamental weaknesses of the self-regulatory system.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Nor did the reforms make the PCC, or the wider self-regulatory system, more independent of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press. There were limited moves towards further independence, manifest in the greater</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involvement of the lay members of the PCC in the appointments process, but given the real</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">constraints on of the independence of the PCC set out at the head of this Chapter, the effect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of this was negligible and served only to allow the impression that a process of reform was</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">underway.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">phone hacking at the NoTW in 2009 in order to reassure the public that something was being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">done by the regulator.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref99" href="#footnote99">99</a></sup> It may be that the PCC&#8217;s general approach to the public presentation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of itself owed much to the bonds which Baroness Buscombe identified in this instance.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Itwas only following the sustained public outcryin response to continued revelations of phone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking that the PCC announced that it intended to address the fundamental weaknesses in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">self-regulatory system. In a press release published on 6 July 2011, after the Guardian had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">published its article alleging that Milly Dowler&#8217;s phone messages had been hacked, the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">announced a review of self-regulation to be carried out by lay members of the Commission.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The remit was to:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref100" href="#footnote100">100</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;[a] review of all aspects of press regulation in its current form, which will be designed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to ensure that public confidence is enhanced. The Commission will wish to review its</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">own constitution and funding arrangements, the range of sanctions available to it,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and its practical independence.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-34"><a href="#para4-34" name="para4-34">4.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The proposal is in marked contrast to previous efforts at self-reflection, which had failed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ask pertinent questions about self-regulation and had led only to cosmetic changes.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-35"><a href="#para4-35" name="para4-35">4.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The self-presentation of the PCC as a competent regulator with adequate powers perpetuated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the unsatisfactory<span style="font-style:italic"> status</span><span style="font-style:italic"> quo</span> . The PCC gave the public a false impression of what it could do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and never acknowledged the limitations of its powers. Through acquiescent silence, the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">permitted policy-makers and the public to make mistaken assumptions about the breadth</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and depth of the powers and capacity of self-regulation. It is damning of the PCC that it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only when the system of regulation was under unprecedented scrutiny and extreme threat,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that a programme of reform was announced that asked questions of import directed squarely</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">at the system&#8217;s failings.</span>
<h3>Restrictions on the PCC&#8217;s ability to reform itself</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-36"><a href="#para4-36" name="para4-36">4.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Linked to the apparent unwillingness of the PCC to implement meaningful reform were real</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">restrictions on the ability to undertake reform. The PCC was not permitted by the industry to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examine, reflect and then act on its own performance. The evidence of Baroness Buscombe</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in this respect is instructive. At the beginning of her tenure as Chair of the PCC, Baroness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Buscombe was convinced that the PCC was sufficiently independent from the press and that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the system did not require substantial reform.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref101" href="#footnote101">101</a></sup> In a speech delivered on 15 November 2009,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">she expressed strong support in principle for the self-regulatory system and in particular</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sought to rebut criticism that the PCC was not independent from the regulated industry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref102" href="#footnote102">102</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The press do not regulate themselves. The PCC is funded by the newspaper and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">magazine industry but operates independently of it. Is independence is guaranteed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by a majority of lay members, and staff who have no vested interest in siding with the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">press. Is that really so difficult to grasp?&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-37"><a href="#para4-37" name="para4-37">4.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, Baroness Buscombe reassessed her view of the independence of the PCC from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry. Shortly before the instigation of the Independent Governance Review, she felt much</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more constrained in the PCC&#8217;s approach to this task. In evidence, she referred in general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terms to the limitations imposed on her by &#8216;the industry&#8217;, making clear that she was required</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to entertain only those issues covered by the PCC&#8217;s terms of reference:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref103" href="#footnote103">103</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It was terribly important for us to demonstrate &#8230; that actually this Commission &#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">[ was] an entirely separate part of the industry. But I also &#8230; found in practice it was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">difficult to be independent when I realised that in order to improve our credibility,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to continue what Christopher Meyer I know has called an evolution &#8211; I wanted a bit</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more of a permanent revolution &#8230; to really improve the governance and structures</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the organisation and to try to put pressure, if I could, with the permission and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">blessing of the Commission, on the industry to accept that &#8230; we needed to up our</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">game in terms of our remit, our sanctions and very much our funding. This is where</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my view of independence changed.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. So is the gist of your evidence this, Lady Buscombe: that you were keen for &#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">revolutionary change, but you were facing resistance from the industry against such</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">change?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes, and that was not at the outset &#8230; My issue was with the &#8211; those who were in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">charge of giving us permission, as it were, where we sought it, to try and improve our</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">funding, improve our resource overall so we could do a better job&#8221;.</span>

<h3>Defensive attack and failure to reform</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-38"><a href="#para4-38" name="para4-38">4.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Representatives of the PCC have tended to reject criticism, and on occasions have made<span style="font-style:italic"> ad</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">reacted strongly to well-informed criticism or what it perceived to be criticism from, amongst</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">others, Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC who was the last Chairman of the Press Council; the Media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Standards Trust; and the journalists John Simpson and Nick Davies.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref104" href="#footnote104">104</a></sup> Typically, criticism</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was repudiated on the basis that the critic had failed to understand the nature of the self-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory system and/or had not placed adequate weight on the importance of freedom of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expression.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-39"><a href="#para4-39" name="para4-39">4.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I draw attention to only two examples in this regard. First, in February 2009 the Media</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Standards Trust published its report,<span style="font-style:italic"> A</span><span style="font-style:italic"> More</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Accountable</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Press.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Part</span><span style="font-style:italic"> 1:</span><span style="font-style:italic"> The</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Need</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ourselves whether this enterprise is being undertaken in good faith...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-40"><a href="#para4-40" name="para4-40">4.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further, on 4 March 2009 the Director of the PCC wrote an internal memorandum to all the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioners, which included the following statements:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref107" href="#footnote107">107</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;As we have maintained throughout, the report is little more than a &#8216;case for the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">prosecution&#8217; ... The question is why they are doing this. To answer this, it is important</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to understand who these people are, and what the genesis of the Media Standards</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Trust is. For, while it sounds like an impressive official body, the MST is, in reality, no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more than a private pressure group of like-minded people who met on a weekend</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">retreat a few years ago &#8211; under the aegis of something called &#8216;Common Purpose&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; and decided that &#8216;something must be done&#8217; about the popular press. One can</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">therefore surmise that their preferred way of achieving this is to replace the PCC with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">something that will be more restrictive...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-4-41"><a href="#para4-41" name="para4-41">4.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, in its 2003 report on Privacy and Media Intrusion, the House of Commons Culture,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Media and Sport (CMS) Select Committee made a number of recommendations in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC. Specifically, it recommended that the PCC Code prohibit payments to the police. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also recommended that there be a ban on newspapers using third parties or intermediaries</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to access private information about people.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref108" href="#footnote108">108</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-42"><a href="#para4-42" name="para4-42">4.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC did not act on these recommendations. Sir Christopher Meyer gave evidence in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to the first of these matters. He has said that the making of payments to the police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was already a breach of the criminal law.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref109" href="#footnote109">109</a></sup> However, this rather simplistic explanation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">overlooks the fact that the codes of other regulators routinely reflect that prohibited conduct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may also amount to a violation of the criminal law. Perhaps more tellingly, the Editors&#8217; Code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Practice itself contains provisions (eg clause 13 of the Code, relating to financial journalism)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the breach of which might well also constitute a violation of the criminal law.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-43"><a href="#para4-43" name="para4-43">4.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, as subsequently addressed in Section 7 below, the Code explicitly covers issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerning subterfuge and mobile phone voicemail hacking which engage the criminal law.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, given the information provided to the CMS Select Committee,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref110" href="#footnote110">110</a></sup> there was at least</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some evidence to suggest that newspapers were paying the police. It therefore rather misses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the point to say that the existence of a criminal provision obviated the need for the Editors&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Code of Practice to proscribe a particular practice.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-44"><a href="#para4-44" name="para4-44">4.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In relation to the second recommendation, no action was taken. Sir Christopher could not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recall whether this second recommendation was discussed with the Commission.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref111" href="#footnote111">111</a></sup> Certainly,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no such ban was implemented. Sir Christopher, spoke to the attitude of the PCC in this respect</span>

<h2>5. The PCC as regulator</h2>

<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In this section of the Report, I examine the issue of the PCC as regulator and examine by turns</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the perception and reality of the functions of the PCC in that regard. I look at and comment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the structural issues that prevented the PCC from functioning as a regulator, and left it as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">little more than a complaints handling body.</span>

<h3>A fundamental failing: the PCC was not a regulator</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is abundantly clear from the evidence before the Inquiry that the PCC was not a regulator</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as that term is commonly understood. It is though perhaps surprising to many of those who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have followed the proceedings of this Inquiry that this perception of the PCC has been shared</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and articulated by some of the most prominent witnesses speaking on behalf of the self-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory system.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref113" href="#footnote113">113</a></sup> Lord Black, now Chairman of PressBoF and formerly Director of the PCC,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gave evidence that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> never</span><span style="font-style:italic"> believed</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> PCC</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> regulator&#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref114" href="#footnote114">114</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-3"><a href="#para5-3" name="para5-3">5.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Wakeham, who was Chair of the PCC from 1995 to 2001, told the Inquiry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref115" href="#footnote115">115</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I was always clear that my task was not to be a &#8216;regulator&#8217; &#8211; the PCC never had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">formal regulatory powers &#8211; but to endeavour to raise standards in the press above</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the minimum required by law through a process of education, exhortation and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">adjudication&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-4"><a href="#para5-4" name="para5-4">5.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That said, his position was that the PCC had taken on more features of a regulator:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref116" href="#footnote116">116</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Over the years, [the PCC] has added on functions that are of a more regulatory nature</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">without its structures or remit being amended accordingly. Most of this happened</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the last few years, culminating in the disastrous report on phone hacking. I also</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">suspect that the PCC&#8217;s Governance Review &#8211; with which I was not impressed &#8211; tried</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to remodel it as a regulatory quango, far removed from its original mission, or its</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">powers or expertise, and with little understanding of the nature of the publishing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">industry.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Of the former Chairs of the PCC who have given evidence to the Inquiry, Sir Christopher</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Meyer is alone in advancing the view that the PCC was a regulator.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref117" href="#footnote117">117</a></sup> He said that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref118" href="#footnote118">118</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;the press in the United Kingdom is regulated by a hybrid system, which is partly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by law and partly through the implementation of the code of practice of the PCC. So</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what I understood...and still do, by &#8216;self-regulation&#8217; was the system which worked</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">through the PCC.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-6"><a href="#para5-6" name="para5-6">5.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In my view, Sir Christopher was utterly mistaken to characterise the PCC as a regulator or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press as a regulated industry. The PCC lacked the structural independence from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press; and the power, the armoury of sanctions or the resources to be a regulator properly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so-called. PCC is better characterised as a complaints and mediation service. Nor did it fulfil</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the function of operating as a standards watchdog within the industry which any regulator</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">properly described would have done.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-7"><a href="#para5-7" name="para5-7">5.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I do not condemn Sir Christopher for labouring under this misapprehension. The PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deliberately and consistently presented itself as the<span style="font-style:italic"> de</span><span style="font-style:italic"> facto</span> regulator. This is not a matter of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">semantics or opinion but rather of fact. The PCC website, the access point to the Commission</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the general public, makes clear in plain English that the PCC is the self-regulator for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press. In this context, it is not necessarily surprising that Sir Christopher was, in this respect, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a minority of one. The candid admissions of Lord Black and Lord Wakeham might be thought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more surprising given the public presentation of the PCC.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-8"><a href="#para5-8" name="para5-8">5.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Despite the obvious deficiencies in its constitution and make up, the PCC and PressBoF</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">presented the self-regulatory system as a whole as if it were a regulator. This self-presentation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">took the form both of explicit assertions and the deliberate adoption of the language of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation in the description of its functions and powers. The effect of this was two-fold.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, it helped to reinforce the perception that the press was subject to an effective system of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulation, as the casual or even the interested observer was capable of being misled, since</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the distinction between the PCC as it was and as it was claimed to be would tend to be elided</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the public mind. Second, the over-statement of its powers weakened the arguments for</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">reform.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-9"><a href="#para5-9" name="para5-9">5.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Examples of this form of self-promotion are legion in the evidence heard by the Inquiry, but I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will set out a handful. In 2005, Sir Christopher gave a speech to the Society of Editors in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he said that the PCC was, by that stage, so independent that it was questionable whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">self-regulation was any longer the correct way of describing it. He said that the PCC was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">creature that broke free from its creators&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref119" href="#footnote119">119</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> The</span><span style="font-style:normal"> clear</span><span style="font-style:normal"> implication</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> this</span><span style="font-style:normal"> speech</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span></span>

<p id="para-id-5-10"><a href="#para5-10" name="para5-10">5.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This misleading self-presentation continued even after the failings and powerlessness of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC had been laid bare. As recently as August 2011, Professor Julian Petley, Professor of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Screen Media and Journalism at Brunel University, wrote an article on the New Left Project</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">website, the substance of which was to argue that the PCC was not and never had been a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator, and would better be described as a mediator.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref120" href="#footnote120">120</a></sup> The PCC posted a rebuttal to this</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Julian Petley is obviously wrong to try to characterise the PCC as merely a mediator</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and not a regulator. He is wrong to suggest there is nothing in the PCC&#8217;s Articles of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Association to suggest it performs a regulatory function when those articles actually</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">specifically state that the PCC has responsibility to: &#8216;consider and pronounce on issues</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relating to the Code of Practice which the Commission, in its absolute discretion</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">considers to be in the public interest&#8217;.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-11"><a href="#para5-11" name="para5-11">5.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Similarly, the press release announcing the appointment of Lord Hunt of Wirral as the new</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Chairman of the PCC declared that he was to oversee the regeneration and renewal of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system of non-statutory regulation of the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref122" href="#footnote122">122</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">its powers and functions that gave the impression that it was more potent than it really</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was. The PCC routinely talked about its &#8216;powers,&#8217; for example in relation to its investigations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or sanctions. The PCC said that it carried out &#8216;investigations&#8217; into complaints, as if it had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specific investigatory powers or the capacity to do more than correspond with contacts inside</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the newspaper. In this respect the PCC projected the impression that it possessed powers,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">competence, status and capacity which it did not.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-13"><a href="#para5-13" name="para5-13">5.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was also an implicit representation that the PCC was exercising regulatory functions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when it accepted responsibility for investigating high-profile scandals involving the printed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media, most notably phone hacking. In announcing its investigation into the allegations on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1 February 2007, the PCC committed itself not only to asking questions of the NoTW editor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Colin Myler, but also to ascertaining what steps other newspapers had taken to prevent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">similar activities from taking place elsewhere. The PCC also committed itself to publishing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> review</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> current</span><span style="font-style:italic"> situation,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span><span style="font-style:italic"> recommendations</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span><span style="font-style:italic"> best</span><span style="font-style:italic"> practice</span><span style="font-style:italic"> if</span><span style="font-style:italic"> necessary,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">order to prevent a similar situation arising in the future. This is in line with [the PCC&#8217;s] duty to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">promote high professional standards of journalism&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref123" href="#footnote123">123</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-14"><a href="#para5-14" name="para5-14">5.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The press release set out steps which might be expected of a typical regulator; in particular</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the initiation of an investigation, taking steps to discover what prophylactic measures were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being taken by particular media groups, and the promotion of standards of conduct within</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the industry. The press release of 1 February 2007 did not admit to any limitations in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">capacity of the PCC to investigate, and was therefore apt to raise expectations unnecessarily.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As I make clear in Section 7 below, the PCC&#8217;s deficient powers impacted directly on the validity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and credibility of that report. The lack of regulatory authority also severely constrained what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC could do in relation to concerns around data protection breaches, as I examine in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more detail below.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-15"><a href="#para5-15" name="para5-15">5.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At this juncture it is pertinent to note the evidence I have heard that has directly linked the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">credibility and efficacy of the PCC to the person and authority of the Chair. David Yelland, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">former editor of The Sun, said that he took the provisions of the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seriously<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;partly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> because</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> respect</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> had</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Lord</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Wakeham,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> then</span><span style="font-style:italic"> PCC</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Chair&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref124" href="#footnote124">124</a></sup> The</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">a number of structural weaknesses which prevented the PCC from operating as a robust and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent regulator.</span>

<h2>6. Structural problems with the PCC</h2>

<h3>Non-universal membership</h3>

<p id="para-id-6-1"><a href="#para6-1" name="para6-1">6.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Membership of the PCC has never been compulsory for publications. Some publications and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media groups, for example, the Northern & Shell Group and the satirical magazine Private Eye,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have concluded that it is not in their interests to participate in the system of self-regulation.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Northern & Shell left the self-regulatory structure for a second time in January 2011, although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its titles still abide by the terms of the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice. Private Eye has never joined</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the self-regulatory structure.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-2"><a href="#para6-2" name="para6-2">6.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Baroness Buscombe recognised the lack of compulsory membership as a weakness in the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref125" href="#footnote125">125</a></sup> as also did the former Director Stephen Abell.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref126" href="#footnote126">126</a></sup> Lord Black said that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref127" href="#footnote127">127</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;PressBoF recognises that this is a weakness in the system, and part of the price we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pay for maintaining voluntary membership. We have done everything we can to bring</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Northern and Shell back into the system, and continue to do so&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-3"><a href="#para6-3" name="para6-3">6.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Black&#8217;s answer raises a number of issues. First, insofar as Lord Black may be suggesting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thattheprice&#8216;wepay&#8217;is an acceptable one,Ientirelydisagree.This is afundamentalweakness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the system and must be acknowledged as such, as indeed should the ineffective nature of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PressBoF&#8217;s efforts to persuade Northern and Shell to re-join, recognising as I do that Lord Black</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and his co-Directors made considerable efforts in this regard. Further, it should be recorded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that having accepting Lord Black&#8217;s assurances that every effort was being made to resolve the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue, Baroness Buscombe did not seek to persuade the Northern & Shell Group back into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the self-regulatory fold after the departure of the group for a second time in January 2011.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref128" href="#footnote128">128</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whilst the PCC has never been able to offer redress to complainants across the whole range</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of publications, this situation has been significantly exacerbated by the position in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Northern and Shell. Although the PCC may still technically have at least 90% coverage, this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">state of affairs is manifestly unsatisfactory.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-4"><a href="#para6-4" name="para6-4">6.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are a number of further issues that link to the voluntary nature of membership and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the lack of appropriate incentives to maintain membership. Perhaps most significantly, if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an editor disliked a particular decision by or approach of the PCC, newspapers could make</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">credible threats to leave the self-regulatory system. Although there were a number of factors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behind the decision of Northern & Shell to leave the PCC, one particular factor identified by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">witnesses for Northern & Shell was the public criticism by Sir Christopher Meyer of Peter Hill ,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the editor of the Daily Express, in light of the coverage by the newspaper of the disappearance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Madeleine McCann.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref129" href="#footnote129">129</a></sup> Whether that criticism should have been couched differently is not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the point: rather the implications of the ability of editors to react to criticism from the PCC in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this way are real.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">It cannot but have shaped the relationship between the PCC and the industry that both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sides knew that newspapers could opt out of the system if they chose. Baroness Buscombe</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gave evidence that during her tenure as Chair, three editors threatened to leave the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a consequence of adverse adjudications.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref130" href="#footnote130">130</a></sup> I acknowledge that her version of events has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been questioned by the editors concerned, but the point of principle remains: the loss of any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editor would naturally be seriously damaging to the effectiveness and reputation of the PCC.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Baroness Buscombe acknowledged that it was a weakness of the system:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref131" href="#footnote131">131</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It is possible for news organisations to register the threat of withdrawing from the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">system following the issuing of decisions against them. I have been made aware of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this in my time as Chairman, although it has never been acted upon. However, it does</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reveal a potential fragility in the system&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-6"><a href="#para6-6" name="para6-6">6.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Chair of the PCC, the Director and Commissioners were well aware of the substantial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">negativeimpactwhich the departureof a major newspapergroup could haveon the credibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the system of self-regulation. It is hard to think that the need to avoid such a catastrophe</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not influence the thinking of these people, committed as they were to the preservation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of self-regulation. At the very least, the fact that an editor could make a credible threat to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">leave on behalf of his or her title would give a reasonable and well-informed observer cause</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to believe that the PCC might seek to avoid criticising newspapers too often or too heavily, for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fear of the consequences to the system of self-regulation.</span>
<h3>Investigating complaints</h3>

<p id="para-id-6-7"><a href="#para6-7" name="para6-7">6.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC has very limited power to investigate complaints. In particular, it does not have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the power to compel parties to produce documents or any other evidence in support of, or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">capable of contradicting, their account of events. The PCC does not have the power to ask for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sworn evidence. There is no sanction for an individual who misleads the PCC, tells half-truths</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or fails to answer the PCC&#8217;s questions.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-8"><a href="#para6-8" name="para6-8">6.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A PCC investigation into a complaint typically involves the complaints officer contacting a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper to ask for its version of the events or justification for the content at the heart of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the complaint. There then follows correspondence between the PCC complaints officer and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a contact at the newspaper, typically the newspaper&#8217;s legal department or managing editor&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">office.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref132" href="#footnote132">132</a></sup> The PCC does not demand documents or other evidence in support of the positions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adopted by the parties, although parties might voluntarily supply these. Complainants</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have access to all material submitted by newspapers in support of their accounts, but do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not necessarily have access to the correspondence between a complaints officer and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref133" href="#footnote133">133</a></sup> The PCC does not request statements from the journalists who researched and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wrote stories.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">If the PCC is to reach fair decisions, it is reliant on editors and complainants not only telling the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">truth but providing a full, fair and balanced account. It has been made clear during the course</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of this Inquiry that when the PCC twice investigated phone hacking this was not the case, as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more fully addressed below. It is impossible to say for certain that they were misled on other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occasions, but given how many cases the PCC dealt with every year it would be surprising</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if they were always given the entire picture or told the whole truth. It cannot be the case</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that entering into correspondence with an editor, or with a legal department or managing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editor&#8217;s office in this way, is tantamount to an investigation in any meaningful sense. Similarly,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">anyone aware these of the limitations would question whether the PCC was really capable of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obtaining facts and coming to safe conclusions about the merits of a complaint.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref134" href="#footnote134">134</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-10"><a href="#para6-10" name="para6-10">6.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On occasion, the lack of investigatory powers meant that the PCC could not resolve a dispute</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between parties. This happens when the accounts provided by the two sides cannot be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reconciled; thus, no negotiated settlement can be reached. The former Director of the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Tim Toulmin gave the following account of this type of finding:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref135" href="#footnote135">135</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There&#8217;s a rare category of ruling called &#8216;no finding&#8217; which occasionally the PCC would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deploy &#8230; but almost always it was possible to reach an outcome whereby, if there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was something wrong, it would be put right.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-11"><a href="#para6-11" name="para6-11">6.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Even if a &#8216;no finding&#8217; ruling was rare, it is highly unsatisfactory that such a result should ever</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">come about; a dispute about the facts leaves a title effectively exonerated (there being no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adverse finding) and no mechanism for a complainant to obtain redress. It is also illustrative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the weakness of the system. Some newspaper figures have recognised that the lack of any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">real investigatory powers was a failing. The editor of the Financial Times, Lionel Barber, said</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that in his view a replacement body for the PCC needed to have the power to investigate and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with this I wholeheartedly concur.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref136" href="#footnote136">136</a></sup></span>

<h3>Powers the PCC did not exercise &#8211; investigations without a complaint and third party complaints</h3>

<p id="para-id-6-12"><a href="#para6-12" name="para6-12">6.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Subject to a small number of refinements set out in evidence by Lord Hunt during the course</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Module Four, which I address further below, the PCC has only investigated complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which come from the person affected by an article or investigation. Baroness Buscombe</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said that, in some cases, third party complaints may receive a response as the PCC does on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occasion seek to contact a directly affected party and progress the complaint.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref137" href="#footnote137">137</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-13"><a href="#para6-13" name="para6-13">6.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The source of the general practice of the PCC in this respect is Article 53.3(a) of the Articles</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Association which govern it:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref138" href="#footnote138">138</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">incorporated or not) but, in addition to the requirements of Article 53.1, shall only be</span>

<p id="para-id-6-14"><a href="#para6-14" name="para6-14">6.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, the PCC does have a discretion to investigate where there is no complaint from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">directly affected party:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref139" href="#footnote139">139</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;53.4 Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 53.3, the Commission shall</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have discretion to consider any complaint from whatever source that it considers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">appropriate to the effective discharge of its function.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-15"><a href="#para6-15" name="para6-15">6.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As a linked issue, Article 53.1A provides:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref140" href="#footnote140">140</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It shall also be the function of Commission to consider and pronounce on issues</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relating to the Code of Practice which the Commission in its absolute discretion</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">considers to be in the public interests [sic]&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-16"><a href="#para6-16" name="para6-16">6.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The difference between these sub-Articles is probably one of degree. On my interpretation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of these provisions (which certainly could be clearer), the PCC has a broad residual power</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to entertain third-party complaints as it sees fit, although no guidance is supplied as to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">type of circumstance which might trigger the discretion. Further, Article 53.4 has to be read</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in conjunction with Article 53.7,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref141" href="#footnote141">141</a></sup> which is heavily weighted in favour of what might be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described as Article 10 (as opposed to Article 8) rights as set out in the EHCR.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref142" href="#footnote142">142</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-17"><a href="#para6-17" name="para6-17">6.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As for Article 53.1A, the Commission&#8217;s discretion under this provision does not presuppose</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the making of any complaint, third party or otherwise. It is a potentially wide-ranging, roving</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">power, which enables the PCC to issue guidance and carry out investigations to the extent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that issues relate to the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice. The scope of this latter investigatory power</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is uncertain: the reference to the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice clearly requires the identification</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of some sort of issue as regards either the interpretation or application of the Code. Whilst</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these are fluid matters, the discretion of the PCC is, in any event, &#8216;absolute&#8217;. I have seen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence that suggests that this Article appears to have been used a number of times by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC, most notably in the two investigations into phone hacking in 2007 and 2009. I use</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the verb &#8216;appears&#8217; because Article 53.1A has not been specifically invoked by the PCC in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this context. There does not appear to have been a clear or consistent policy applied to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exercise of this discretion.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-18"><a href="#para6-18" name="para6-18">6.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In this regard the evidence of Lord Wakeham and of Tim Toulmin about the investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of third party complaints illustrates the attitude of both the PCC and the industry to such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints. Lord Wakeham suggested that following his appointment as Chair, there was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressure from the industry to prevent third parties from complaining about stories which did</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not directly affect them:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref143" href="#footnote143">143</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;when I got there, the Press Council [sic] had fallen into considerable disrepute with</span>

<a name="page1547"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">making a lot of complaints and many of them are pretty frivolous &#8230;. and they did say</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Press Complaints Commission is there to deal with people&#8217;s complaints who have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an interest in the complaint, a proper interest. In other words, if they [say] something</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about me, Joe Bloggs can&#8217;t complain. I can complain. It has to be relative to me.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">That&#8217;s what they wanted to do and I was trying to get that system worked.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-19"><a href="#para6-19" name="para6-19">6.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Toulmin gave the following reasons for the failure to exercise the discretion to investigate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">third-party complaints more regularly:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref144" href="#footnote144">144</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The position&#8230;is that the PCC pretty much takes all complaints but where there is a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">first party, their engagement is required. The saga of &#8211; very much in the early days</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the PCC, where Lord McGregor made statements about Princess Diana and so on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">based on an understanding &#8211; a sort of outrage about how she was being treated, was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">very much seared on the consciousness of the Commission for years to come, which is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that it is impossible to really take a view about the merits under the code of particular</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">articles unless you have the involvement of the person concerned.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-20"><a href="#para6-20" name="para6-20">6.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry received evidence from a number of witnesses about the impact of this policy; it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">renders it impossible for individuals or representative groups to bring complaints on behalf</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of sections of the community who were the subject of misleading or discriminatory articles.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Representatives of the Irish Traveller Movement in Britain made the point in the following</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref145" href="#footnote145">145</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The result [of the PCC&#8217;s refusal to accept third party complaints] is that as long</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as they are carefully worded, derogatory references to Travellers can be published</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">repeatedly, as they were in the Sun&#8217;s &#8216;Stamp on the camps&#8217; campaign, without</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">committing any offence. Yet it is clear that articles of that sort do cause substantial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">damage to the rights and reputations of Travellers, fanning hostility against them in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">settled communities.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-21"><a href="#para6-21" name="para6-21">6.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I now turn briefly to the refinement raised in evidence by Lord Hunt to which I referred at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">paragraph 6.12 above. Lord Hunt said that the practice of the PCC has been to entertain third</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">party complaints &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> accuracy</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> point</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> fact</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref146" href="#footnote146">146</a></sup> However, exactly how this practice has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been conducted remains unclear. Many issues of &#8216;fact&#8217; may, on analysis, be issues of opinion.</span>

<h3>Monitoring and investigations</h3>

<p id="para-id-6-22"><a href="#para6-22" name="para6-22">6.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC did not monitor for breaches of the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice, nor did it launch</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigations into potential breaches of the Code of its own volition. In response to comments</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made in the Report in 2010 by the CMS Select Committee into Press Standards, Privacy and</span>

<p id="para-id-6-23"><a href="#para6-23" name="para6-23">6.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In a speech made in May 2003, Sir Christopher Meyer, expressed the view that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref148" href="#footnote148">148</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;any measure that would turn the PCC into a directive body &#8211; initiating complaints at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">random, intervening in issues which are nothing to do with the Code, or establishing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any superior service for the rich and famous. We have a set of rules that work well for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">everyone &#8211; regardless of status &#8211; and we move away from them at our peril&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-24"><a href="#para6-24" name="para6-24">6.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not clear what link is supposed to exist between the initiation of complaints and a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">differential service being offered to different categories of complainant. It is true that an issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under the Code would always have to arise, but that is so obvious that it goes without saying;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC could not act if no question of breach of the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice had arisen.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-25"><a href="#para6-25" name="para6-25">6.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The reference to moving away from rules &#8216;at our peril&#8217; serves to elide two different concerns:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the first, that the PCC might apply rules which were not rooted in the Code (a justifiable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern); the second that the PCC might take upon itself the function of investigating clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breaches of the Code in the absence of a direct complaint (an unjustifiable one). Neither do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I understand the reference to the rich and famous. They are, presumably, more likely to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aware of the existence of the PCC, their rights and the ability to complain: the willingness to</span>

<p id="para-id-6-26"><a href="#para6-26" name="para6-26">6.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are clearly circumstances when it would have been appropriate for the PCC to launch</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an investigation of its own motion, deploying the powers at its disposal under Article 53.1A.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One clear case is in relation to newspaper coverage following the disappearance of Madeleine</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">McCann. A fuller exploration of the conduct of the press in that case appears in Part F Chapter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">5 above, but for present purposes the focus is on the PCC alone. It is easy to see why the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">McCanns might not have wished to launch complaints on their own account, given the scale</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and tone of media interest in them, and the nature of Sir Christopher Meyer&#8217;s advice to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr Gerry McCann. It is, in my judgment, inexplicable that the PCC chose not to exercise its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discretion to investigate in such a case.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-27"><a href="#para6-27" name="para6-27">6.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I note in this regard that a number of individuals gave evidence that they did not complain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the PCC because they were concerned that doing so would lead to retaliation from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper industry in the shape of negative coverage or future invasions of privacy. Had the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC initiated investigations of its own motion, or accepted third party complaints, the issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of retaliation would have been deadened. The PCC&#8217;s policy served to perpetuate a wholly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unsatisfactory state of affairs whereby complaints were (and remain) dis-incentivised and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC&#8217;s own contribution to the evolving principles surrounding the issue of privacy in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular is limited.

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-29"><a href="#para6-29" name="para6-29">6.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are a number of issues with these provisions which need to be explored. First, they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">incorrectly draw no distinction between criminal and civil proceedings. In the event that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC might become aware that a criminal investigation or proceeding has commenced, it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obviously right that the PCC should defer any investigation it might undertake of its own</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">motion until such proceedings have been concluded. This is the practice of comparable bodies</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsible for the regulation of a profession, such as the General Medical Council. Although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in cases involving professionals it is standard practice to suspend individuals from practice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pending the outcome of the criminal process, I fully recognise that different considerations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rightly apply in relation to the press. The deferral of regulatory investigation may be regarded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a self-denying ordinance designed to meet the wider interests of justice and the possibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of creating prejudice.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-30"><a href="#para6-30" name="para6-30">6.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The position is different in relation to civil proceedings. There may be reasons, depending</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the facts of the particular case, for awaiting the outcome of such proceedings before</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commencing any regulatory process, but there is no requirement to elevate this into an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">absolute prohibition; Article 53.3(b) is currently framed in those terms.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-31"><a href="#para6-31" name="para6-31">6.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, and regardless of whether the proceedings in issue are criminal or civil, the provision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been interpreted by the PCC in such a way that as soon as any proceedings begin the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ability of the PCC to entertain a complaint is precluded.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref150" href="#footnote150">150</a></sup> But this is not how the provision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is framed, as is apparent from the use of the present tense in Article 53.3(b). Neither is it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the manner in which most regulators operate: extant proceedings may be a current bar to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulatory action (ie, for so long as the proceedings may continue), but not an indefinite</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prohibition.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-32"><a href="#para6-32" name="para6-32">6.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Third, Article 53.3(c) is potentially of extremely wide application since most breaches of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Code could also give rise to civil action; this provision as drafted therefore suggests that in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these circumstances (ie, the paradigm case of Code breach) the entertaining of a complaint by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC requires particular justification. Since there is no policy setting out how the PCC will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exercise the discretion established by this Article, it is not clear whether the PCC interpreted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this provision in so restrictive a manner. What is clear is that these Articles taken together</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were the purported basis for Sir Christopher Meyer&#8217;s advice to Dr McCann that the latter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should take legal action in relation to highly defamatory and offensive articles above the</span>

The position is the same as regards the FSA</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1550"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">disappearance of his daughter Madeleine, but that such a course of action would prohibit Dr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">McCann from seeking redress through the PCC.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref151" href="#footnote151">151</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-33"><a href="#para6-33" name="para6-33">6.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In one area at least, the PCC appears to have been eager to take on cases which might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">otherwise have resulted in civil actions. Exercising this discretion, the PCC sought to gather in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as many cases relating to privacy as possible, thereby restricting the number of privacy actions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which went before the courts, despite (or perhaps because of) the option for complainants</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to bring a civil action for breach of privacy at least since the passage of the Human Rights</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Act.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref152" href="#footnote152">152</a></sup> In my view these provisions have a stifling effect on the operation of the PCC, and are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exceptionable. There was a lack of consistency and transparency in the exercise of the PCC&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discretion under Article 53.3(c) that militated against the proper function of the organisation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as a proper regulator. More so the use of this discretion, particularly with regard to privacy,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">helped facilitate the PCC&#8217;s function as a shield for newspapers against litigation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref153" href="#footnote153">153</a></sup></span>
<h3>Powers the PCC did not exercise &#8211; failure to hold oral hearings</h3>

<p id="para-id-6-34"><a href="#para6-34" name="para6-34">6.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC has not held oral hearings in any cases. This means that it has not had the opportunity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to ask questions or assess the credibility of parties where facts were contested. This was a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deliberate practice and not the consequence of the lack of any relevant powers. The PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had power to hold oral hearings under the existing Articles of Association, and PressBoF had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argued this point in response to recommendations made by the CMS Select Committee.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref154" href="#footnote154">154</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The 2010 Independent Governance Review had also recommended that the PCC move to a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">policy of holding such hearings.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref155" href="#footnote155">155</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-35"><a href="#para6-35" name="para6-35">6.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC has justified this reluctance to use these powers on the basis that that it might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compromise its commitment to being free and fair. It has argued that oral hearings would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lead to the involvement of lawyers, and that that would introduce a layer of expense and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">delay.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref156" href="#footnote156">156</a></sup> But this is to overstate the position. First, this line of argument rather conveniently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ignores the fact that the industry often engaged lawyers when responding to complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made through the PCC; this is a feature that I explore in more detail below. Second, oral</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hearings would not be regarded as the general rule, but would only meet the end of justice in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a case of particular complexity or where a dispute of fact arises on the material placed before</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC. In any event, the PCC would not be looking at a system which encouraged mini-trials</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and concomitant expense and delay, but something far more streamlined and practical.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-36"><a href="#para6-36" name="para6-36">6.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The holding of hearings where appropriate might have allowed the PCC better to demonstrate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publicly that it had the capacity to find facts and to question any inconsistencies which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">emerged from the parties&#8217; accounts of events. It may also have helped mitigate the small but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unfortunate and, in my view, unnecessary number of cases in which no resolution or finding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of fact could be made.</span>

<a name="page1551"></a><!--new page--><h3>Inequality of arms</h3>

<p id="para-id-6-37"><a href="#para6-37" name="para6-37">6.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC has argued that one of the fundamental advantages of the existing system of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">self-regulation is that there is no need for complainants to go to the expense of engaging</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">solicitors, as complaints officers employed by the PCC will oversee the process on behalf of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the complainant. I note that in some cases complainants have chosen to do so irrespective of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the cost. However, this line of argument serves to disguise a fundamental mismatch in terms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of both resource and expertise, as the response of individual newspapers to complainants</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is mostly undertaken by the legal department or managing editors of the newspaper in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref157" href="#footnote157">157</a></sup> Thus, while respondent publications have the benefit of legal assistance,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complainants rely in the main on the PCC complaints officers to act as their advocate in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">process.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-38"><a href="#para6-38" name="para6-38">6.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are two fundamental issues at play in this regard. The first relates to the training and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">experience of complaints officers at the PCC. The second relates to their role in the complaints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">process. Whilst I am satisfied that the complaint officers at the PCC were highly professional</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">group of people who were skilled at what they did and did their best in trying circumstances,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I do not accept that there existed in any way parity of arms between them and the lawyers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and managing editors who responded on behalf of the industry. Complaints officers at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC are typically recruited straight from university or soon after graduating. There is no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requirement that they have any particular experience.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref158" href="#footnote158">158</a></sup> As at September 2011, only two of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the complaints officers had legal training; the others joined from other industries.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref159" href="#footnote159">159</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-39"><a href="#para6-39" name="para6-39">6.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The past two Directors of the PCC (excluding the present transitional director, from whom</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry has not heard) were also recruited from within the ranks of complaints officers.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Neither of them had had any substantial experience outside the PCC secretariat, and both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were elevated to the position of Director at a relatively young age.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref160" href="#footnote160">160</a></sup> I have already expressed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">my positive view of the abilities and qualities of Mr Toulmin and Mr Abell. However, the role</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Director (effectively Chief Executive) of the PCC necessarily involved dealing with highly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">experienced figures within the newspaper industry, politics and other areas. There is at least</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a question mark over whether they had the overall fire-power to handle the leaders of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">industry within the PCC&#8217;s purview. I doubt that the relationship was seen as being equal.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-40"><a href="#para6-40" name="para6-40">6.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">My second point relates to the function of the PCC complaints officers in this context. As set</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out above, users of the services of the PCC often spoke of the politeness and helpfulness of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these complaints officers, as well as their ability to conjure up imaginative solutions. However,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it would be fundamentally incorrect to suggest that the PCC represented the complainant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the process, and in so doing helped to bridge the even greater chasm in expertise and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">experience that existed between the vast majority of those who made complaints and the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">particularly for the victims of press mistreatment, being unable to challenge in any way the</span>

<h3>Lack of powers &#8211; sanctions</h3>

<p id="para-id-6-41"><a href="#para6-41" name="para6-41">6.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC does not have sufficient sanctions to act as a deterrent against breaches of the Code.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC sanctions are limited to admonishment<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref161" href="#footnote161">161</a></sup> and the publication of adjudications. While it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may be embarrassing for editors to publish adjudications, this sanction is not enough to deter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">repeat offending. Further, I have seen no evidence that the sanctions regime overall has had a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">long-term impact on the behaviour and actions of publications or journalists who were found</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to have transgressed.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-42"><a href="#para6-42" name="para6-42">6.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am gratified that there is some support even among press figures for the conclusion that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the sanctions available to the PCC&#8217;s battery are insufficient. For example, the Editor-in-Chief</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Associated Newspapers, Paul Dacre, said at one of the Inquiry&#8217;s seminars in October 2011</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, in his view, fines should be available in cases of the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> most</span><span style="font-style:italic"> extreme</span><span style="font-style:italic"> malfeasance</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref162" href="#footnote162">162</a></sup> The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editor of the Financial Times, Lionel Barber, gave evidence that an ability to impose fines is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">essential for any replacement for the PCC. However, Mr Barber also emphasised that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">printing of prominent apologies or corrections were a real deterrent for editors.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref163" href="#footnote163">163</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-43"><a href="#para6-43" name="para6-43">6.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, PCC witnesses have defended the current range of sanctions as adequate. Sir</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Christopher Meyer, for example, gave evidence that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref164" href="#footnote164">164</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;IhadspentsometimestudyingthePCCbeforetakingthisjob&#8230;.andwhathadbecome</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">clear to me was that editors just did not like having to admit in their own newspapers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that they had screwed up, in terms over which they had no control. That is to say</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the text of the adjudication, as agreed by the Commission, had to be reproduced</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">verbatim, under a PCC rubric in the newspaper&#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So it wasn&#8217;t as if the statement &#8216;no editor wants the blemish of a negative adjudication</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on his or her record&#8217; was some rash thing that I pulled from the sky. It was based on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my experience, from what I&#8217;d read, from the experience of others in the PCC, Lord</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Black, who had been director for some time, and I have to say to you&#8230;after six years,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it was an impression, again, that was strongly reinforced from my own experience&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-44"><a href="#para6-44" name="para6-44">6.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC has argued that that fines are unnecessary, disproportionate and liable to create an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">overly legalistic disciplinary process. This line of argument has been advanced by a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of witnesses from the PCC. Sir Christopher set out the fundamentals of this argument in a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">speech in 2003:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref165" href="#footnote165">165</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that this would entail. You could throw &#8216;free&#8217; and &#8216;fast&#8217; out of the window. Those who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">believe that fines mean sharper teeth fail to understand that no editor wants the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">blemish of a negative adjudication on his or her record.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-45"><a href="#para6-45" name="para6-45">6.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, the points raised by Sir Christopher misunderstand the difference between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">providing redress (which must be free and fast) and the maintenance of standards which can</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be entirely free standing of the mechanism for complaints. Neither do I accept that it would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessarily lead to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> colonisation</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> system</span><span style="font-style:italic"> by</span><span style="font-style:italic"> lawyers</span> &#8221;: it would depend on the way</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in which the &#8216;system&#8217; was set up and operated.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-46"><a href="#para6-46" name="para6-46">6.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Wakeham also gave evidence that explains the thinking underpinning the PCC&#8217;s historical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opposition to fines. First, it would have been inappropriate for editors to be involved in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fining of other editors. Second, fines would have affected publications differentially. Third, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extreme cases newspapers might be put out of business by fines.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref166" href="#footnote166">166</a></sup> In my view none of these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arguments has any foundation. Clearly, editors should not be involved in decisions leading to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the fining of other editors, but this is an argument for removing editors from the decision-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">making process rather than for failing to empower the Commission where necessary. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">economic arguments against fines clearly could be met by requiring the regulator to take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ability to pay into account (as is standard in any regime which supports the imposition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of financial penalties). In any event, fines would be reserved for only the most serious or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">systemic breaches of the Code.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-47"><a href="#para6-47" name="para6-47">6.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC&#8217;s opposition to a system of fines is longstanding. Writing in<span style="font-style:italic"> Risk</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Regulation</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">magazine in Autumn 2008, Tim Toulmin suggested that fines were unlikely to be effective,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggesting that they were a weaker sanction that an adverse adjudication:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref167" href="#footnote167">167</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8221;[A] common misunderstanding is about the power of peer pressure: some people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">don&#8217;t rate it and think that only a system of fines would be an adequate deterrent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or punishment. They couldn&#8217;t be more wrong. When the PCC sharpens its claws for a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public criticism of an editor the howls of pain are loud and clear. No editor wants their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decisions held up in public by their professional standards body as an example of bad</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">practice. On the other hand, fines are a corporate rather than a personal punishment,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and therefore not as keenly felt.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-48"><a href="#para6-48" name="para6-48">6.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am not impressed by this argument at all. Fines would be in addition to the publication of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the companion adjudication. In the appropriate case, the editor could be required to pay</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an individual fine (whether or not his paper would defray the cost on his behalf would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">another matter); and, in any event, a substantial fine imposed on a company would mark the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seriousness of the breach and impact on the reputation of the editor.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-49"><a href="#para6-49" name="para6-49">6.49</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Baroness Buscombe raised a different issue; she suggested that the introduction of fines might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ruin the collaborative relationship between the self-regulatory structure and the industry and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this would have threatened the PCC&#8217;s ability to do its work:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref168" href="#footnote168">168</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;the whole issue of fines is quite fraught, one of the reasons being it has the risk</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of turning the system from one that is collaborative &#8211; which is really important on a</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">collaborative can actually produce very good results as opposed to adversarial, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">when you introduce a system of fines, there is a concern that that might break down</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the collaborative relationship.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-50"><a href="#para6-50" name="para6-50">6.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thisevidence,however,betraysthefundamentalflawattheheartoftherelationshipbetween</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC and the entities that it was supposed to be regulating, that uniquely it depends on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an element of consent and collaboration between these parties. Although collusion would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">too strong a term, the terms of engagement lack an appropriate deference; the concern to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">achieve collaboration should not be the order of the day, but rather the press should respect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those who are regulating it. One only needs to compare the position of the Bar Standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Board, the Solicitors&#8217; Regulation Authority and the General Medical Council to begin to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understand the fundamental difference between the colour and dynamics of a relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between a regulator properly so called and the entities or parties being regulated.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-51"><a href="#para6-51" name="para6-51">6.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The point I make here is a cultural one, and does not ignore the fact that the bodies I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identified are regulators of professional people rather than of an industry like the press: I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">am doing no more than pointing out the nature of the relationship between regulator and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulated. Furthermore, none of what I am saying in this context is intended to suggest that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a regulated entity should not be assisting the regulator &#8211; in that specific sense, collaborating</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with it &#8211; if and when a complaint is made or the need for an investigation arises.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-52"><a href="#para6-52" name="para6-52">6.52</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is one further piece of evidence which lays bare the nature of the relationship between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC on the one hand and editors in particular in this regard. Until the amendment of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice in January 2011, the only obligation on editors in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the publication of adverse adjudications was that they should be given &#8216;due prominence&#8217;.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ultimately, this was a matter of judgment for the editor in question, rather than a matter for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC to impose. Sir Christopher Meyer was asked why he did not advocate amendments</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Code which would have enabled the PCC to insist on the placement of any adjudication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the newspaper, as it were whether the editor liked it or not. It was put to him that any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator worthy of the name would have armed itself with such a power; Sir Christopher&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">answer was that he had other more pressing priorities.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref169" href="#footnote169">169</a></sup> Even now, the Code states that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> prominence</span><span style="font-style:italic"> should</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> agreed</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> PCC</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> advance</span> &#8221;,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref170" href="#footnote170">170</a></sup> a provision which sets out the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expectation of a negotiation rather than any imposed outcome.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-53"><a href="#para6-53" name="para6-53">6.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Overall, it is clear that the armoury of the PCC is limited and needs enhancement. I recognise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the industry has recently come to accept the force of this: the proposal put forward on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behalf of the industry by Lord Black confers the power on the new body to levy fines in cases</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of serious or systemic breaches. Further, I should not be interpreted as suggesting that fines</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are appropriate in every case. In Part K Chapter 7 below I identify the circumstances in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ability to impose a fine should exist. I should also make clear that my concern is not with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the notion of an adverse adjudication; the Inquiry has heard examples of other regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">systems in which the publication of an adverse adjudication is a real and effective sanction,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but with the particular operation of this system through the PCC.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is no evidence that even the most severe sanctions available to the PCC had a real</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impact on those who transgressed. Although much emphasis was placed on the editors&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fear of an adverse adjudication, the impact of such an adjudication did not go beyond this;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers did not lose circulation as a consequence of criticism by the PCC nor is there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">much evidence that editors or journalists were disciplined in any significant manner<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref171" href="#footnote171">171</a></sup> or that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their careers were in any way affected by PCC criticism.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-55"><a href="#para6-55" name="para6-55">6.55</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lord Wakeham set out the steps he made to improve public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">trust in the work of the PCC: including improvements to the sanctions available to the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and particularly the inclusion into journalists&#8217; contracts of the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;so</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Wakeham also cited the example of the public admonishment of Piers Morgan by Rupert</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch in 1995 following a strong PCC adjudication relating to the publication of pictures</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Countess Spencer in the grounds of a private clinic as evidence of the effectiveness of the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">This same episode was dealt with in evidence by Piers Morgan himself. However, the gist</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of his evidence was somewhat different. Mr Morgan recalled a later conversation with Mr</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">A similar pattern of events followed the public criticism of the former editor of the Daily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Express, Peter Hill. Sir Christopher Meyer criticised Mr Hill for his newspaper&#8217;s coverage of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, coverage for which the Express eventually</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apologised publicly and paid substantial damages to the McCann family for defamation.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, when, somewhat late in the day, Sir Christopher excoriated Mr Hill and the Express&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">coverage on the Radio 4 Today programme, the response of Northern & Shell&#8217;s proprietor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Richard Desmond was not to criticise Mr Hill but rather to commiserate with him:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref178" href="#footnote178">178</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I remember that night after he was attacked by the chairman of the PCC, I remember</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">calling him at 11 o&#8217;clock at night. I think he was convinced I was going to fire him. But</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I didn&#8217;t fire him, I spoke to him from 11 o&#8217;clock for about two hours and my ex-wife</span>

<p id="para-id-6-58"><a href="#para6-58" name="para6-58">6.58</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In these two instances, criticism of an editor by the PCC &#8211; whether by formal adjudication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or very public criticism by its Chair &#8211; does not seem to have had any negative effect on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">careers of the editors concerned. Mr Morgan went on to continue a very high-profile career</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in journalism; Mr Hill is still employed by Northern & Shell as Editor Emeritus, although he did</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resign from the PCC shortly after the events in question. There is nothing to indicate in either</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case that the involvement of the PCC had the impact which is claimed for it.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-59"><a href="#para6-59" name="para6-59">6.59</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has heard similar evidence from other quarters. For example, a former journalist</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the People, was recorded by the film maker Chris Atkins discussing the PCC. It is clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the conversation that the journalist was not overly concerned about the consequences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of getting an adverse PCC decision:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref179" href="#footnote179">179</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;getting a PCC isn&#8217;t great, but a lot of papers just kind of brush it aside &#8211; all it is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a little apology, somewhere in the paper &#8211; you get a slap on the wrists if you get</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reported by the PCC, but there&#8217;s no money.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-60"><a href="#para6-60" name="para6-60">6.60</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Inquiry has heard evidence from a number of editors and representatives of the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">itself that journalists now routinely have a requirement to comply with the Editors&#8217; Code of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Practice as a condition of their contracts. It was suggested that this meant that criticism by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC had real weight because it might lead to disciplinary action. However, the Inquiry has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">heard of only one instance of this ever happening. This evidence was provided by Stephen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Abell. He recalled the dismissal of the journalists working on the Daily Mirror&#8217;s &#8216;City Slickers&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">column for breach of the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice. Mr Abell gave the following account of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">events:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref180" href="#footnote180">180</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In an internal inquiry, the company concluded that the journalists involved had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">breached the Editors&#8217; Code; as their contracts of employment had Code compliance</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">written into them, the journalists were dismissed.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-61"><a href="#para6-61" name="para6-61">6.61</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Doubtless the &#8216;City Slickers&#8217; journalists were in serious breach of the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, given that their activities eventually led to their being convicted for criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offences, it is impossible to believe that they would not have been dismissed in any case.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I also record that the dismissal came following an internal investigation rather than a PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation. It is therefore difficult to draw the inference that the inclusion of provisions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requiring adherence to the Editors&#8217; Code in journalists&#8217; contracts of employment has in itself</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resulted in improved behaviour or, as asserted by Lord Wakeham, effectively given the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an additional, effective, sanction.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-62"><a href="#para6-62" name="para6-62">6.62</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The picture that emerges from this evidence is that while editors and others may have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personally embarrassed by criticisms by the PCC, the sting was the result of the personal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dislike of being criticised rather than the sanction.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref181" href="#footnote181">181</a></sup> In this respect I am in agreement with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethicist, Dr Neil C. Manson of the University of Lancaster. In his written evidence he described</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">is a correct assessment. Whatever their limited merits, they did not provide a sufficiently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">powerful deterrent to prevent journalists and editors from breaching the Editors&#8217; Code of</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Conduct.</span>

<h3>Too many negotiated settlements</h3>

<p id="para-id-6-63"><a href="#para6-63" name="para6-63">6.63</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Many witnesses and commentators have criticised the PCC for mediating too many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints to a negotiated conclusion rather than giving formal adjudications.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref183" href="#footnote183">183</a></sup> A number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of reasons have been advanced for this: newspapers know how to string out the process,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">causing &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> complaint</span><span style="font-style:italic"> fatigue</span> &#8221;; newspapers prefer to come to some sort of private accord with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complainants to avoid the likelihood of an adverse adjudication; and the whole system is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">geared towards PCC complaints officers acting as mediators and conduits to the compromise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of disputes.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-64"><a href="#para6-64" name="para6-64">6.64</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A cursory examination of the statistics shows that few complaints reach the stage of formal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adjudication, and that &#8211; although the figures vary from year to year &#8211; about half of these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are resolved in favour of the complainant.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref184" href="#footnote184">184</a></sup> This very last statistic does not give cause for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern in itself, but given the number of complaints in any one year what is troubling is the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">paucity of cases which eventually arrive at the adjudication stage. The PCC would claim that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this is a mark of the success rather than the weakness of the system. That is because many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complainants welcome a relatively speedy resolution, and in a different context it might be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remarked that well over 95% of all civil disputes are resolved consensually, although as I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">note elsewhere,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref185" href="#footnote185">185</a></sup> resolution through mediation is not always speedy. However, given that a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mediated complaint does not feature in any statistics as a breach of the Code, is seems clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that from the point of view of public accountability and compliance there is a misleading</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">picture.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-65"><a href="#para6-65" name="para6-65">6.65</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further, this different context does need to be understood. The policy reasons militating in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">favour of the compromise of private disputes (cost; avoidance of court time; the preference</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for settlement over a fight to the bitter end) do not apply with anything like the same force</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to matters which possess, or at least ought to possess, a regulatory or standards</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dimension. In most regulatory regimes, the complainant and the regulated party are given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the opportunity to sort out the dispute between themselves,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref186" href="#footnote186">186</a></sup> but once that process breaks</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">down the regulator takes over and investigates the matter. There is a balance to be struck</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between mediation and formal adjudication, but I have little doubt but that under the current</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system that balance has fallen in the wrong place.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-66"><a href="#para6-66" name="para6-66">6.66</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC has not been transparent about its own performance and the performance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspapers.Figurespublishedpurportingtodemonstratebothwerenoteasytounderstand,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref187" href="#footnote187">187</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meaning that the public could not readily assess the performance of the PCC in particular or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the newspapers which came into contact with it. Throughout there is an imprecision as to</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">the use of language which obscures meaning. The words &#8216;ruling&#8217;, &#8216;decision&#8217;, &#8216;adjudication&#8217; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;resolution&#8217; are nowhere defined and appear to be used interchangeably. Mr Toulmin was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken at length through the statistics for 2007 (this year chosen at random to illustrate the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">point). From these, it was difficult to understand:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) the basis for sifting out approximately 50% of complaints at the first stage;</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">(b)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the basis on which complaints were assessed as raising a<span style="font-style:italic"> prima</span><span style="font-style:italic"> facie</span> issue under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Code at the second stage;</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">(c)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what was meant by the term &#8216;rulings&#8217; in this second context given that so many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints were thereafter mediated to a compromise; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) the exact basis on which certain complaints went forward to adjudication.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref188" href="#footnote188">188</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-67"><a href="#para6-67" name="para6-67">6.67</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This lack of transparency is strikingly thrown into relief by a comparison between two separate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pieces of data. In January 2011, just after the departure of the Northern & Shell titles from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the system, the director of the PCC wrote an internal memorandum to the Commissioners</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">informing them of the ramifications.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref189" href="#footnote189">189</a></sup> This stated as follows:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In 2009 the PCC received 719 complaints about Express titles...It made 140 rulings,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">including 52 occasions where there was a breach of the Code that required remedial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">action.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">These are significant complaints figures (in comparison all News International titles</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">produced 790 complaints, 292 rulings and 90 breaches of the Code. The complaints</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">also tend to focus on controversial issues such as immigration, and often cluster</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">around articles that cause particular and widespread comment...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-68"><a href="#para6-68" name="para6-68">6.68</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Anumberofpointsneedtobemadeaboutthis.First,acomparisonbetweentheseunpublished</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">data and the PCC&#8217;s published statistics<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref190" href="#footnote190">190</a></sup> shows a stark discrepancy: for example, whereas the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">former demonstrate that the PCC apparently upheld 142 breaches of the Code in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">two publishers alone, the latter appear to show a much lower figure. Furthermore, the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appears to be in a position whereby complaints statistics can be given on a publisher specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">basis. The clear inference is that more could be done to explain the position to the public.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Overall, these statistics as presented in the Annual Reviews have tended to underplay the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significance of mediation as the centre piece of the PCC&#8217;s work as well as to obscure the fact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that many so called &#8216;prima facie&#8217; breaches of the Code were, in fact, likely breaches. Further,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC have failed to publish aggregate figures for complaints made against newspapers,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meaning that neither the public nor policy-makers could get any idea of which publications</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were most regularly in breach of the Editors&#8217; Code of Conduct. In any event, any newspapers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who adopted a strategy of settling complaints at a late stage (by which time the merits of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the complaints would have been clear) in order to avoid adverse adjudications would not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be accurately represented in any league table. Although it is not clear why this practice was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adopted, what is clear is that it worked to the advantage of the industry, who could point</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to near unblemished records in relation to breaches of the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice; the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence as revealed in Mr Abell&#8217;s memorandum to the Commission was, in fact, manifestly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of commentators have observed that the public profile of the PCC has been too low.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">in this respect. The evidence shows that the PCC has had some difficulty in publicising itself</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the work that it did. Certainly, the PCC made some efforts to raise its profile, first by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">asking publications to donate space both in print editions and online to publicising the work</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the PCC; and also by engaging in profile raising events around the country.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-71"><a href="#para6-71" name="para6-71">6.71</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Under the Chairmanship of Lord Wakeham, this was done through seeking out high profile</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complainants, thereby raising the profile of the organisation when it was reported that such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a complainant had used the services of the PCC. In Lord Wakeham&#8217;s view the failure in recent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">years to attract high-profile complainants has been a real weakness of the system and has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contributed to the loss of confidence among the public more generally:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref191" href="#footnote191">191</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;the respect of the PCC has gone down in recent years because they haven&#8217;t had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the high-profile complaints they used to have, and the high-profile complainers say</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;we would sooner take the matter to the courts&#8217;&#8221; therefore the PCC doesn&#8217;t deal with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">them, the PCC&#8217;s standing goes down&#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-72"><a href="#para6-72" name="para6-72">6.72</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Other senior figures at the PCC also recognised that the lack of prominence in the public mind</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was a serious problem which hindered the organisation from doing its work. Mr Toulmin, said</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in evidence to the Inquiry that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref192" href="#footnote192">192</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;one of the things that used to strike me, and upset me&#8230;was hearing from members</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the public who had a perfectly reasonable complaint to make or we could have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">helped in some way stopping harassment or helping them with their difficulty and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they&#8217;d never heard of the PCC &#8230; although it does have quite a high name recognition,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it&#8217;s by no means universal, and the newspaper and magazine industry is in a very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">good position to refer prominently to the existence of this organisation, and whilst</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they did do some good work and they published numerous free adverts at obviously</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expense to themselves, their regular references to the PCC were much less impressive,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I thought, than they could have been&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, it must be acknowledged that this is not a new issue. For example in August 2004,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was an exchange of letters between Sir Brian Cubbon, then Chair of the PCC Charter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Compliance Panel, and Sir Christopher, concerning the very same question of prominence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and publicity being given to the PCC.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref193" href="#footnote193">193</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-74"><a href="#para6-74" name="para6-74">6.74</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In this respect, I understand Mr Toulmin&#8217;s point; it is well made. It cannot simply be the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibility of the PCC or the self-regulatory system itself to raise the PCC&#8217;s profile by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attracting well known complainants or otherwise publicising its work. In any event, seeking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to attract well known complainants might be thought to be making assumptions about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the validity of complaints that they might wish to make: to attract a complaint that is then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dismissed would hardly encourage others. The press could and should have done more to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assist with that project so that no potential complainant was left in ignorance of the existence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the PCC or of the services it could offer.</span>

<h2>7. Investigatory failures</h2>

<p id="para-id-7-1"><a href="#para7-1" name="para7-1">7.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In this section of this Chapter I will examine the PCC&#8217;s response, or rather the lack of it, to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Motorman before moving to an assessment of the reports of 2007 and 2009 into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">phone hacking.</span>

<h3>Operation Motorman</h3>
<p id="para-id-7-2"><a href="#para7-2" name="para7-2">7.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The narrative of the detailed discussions that took place between the PCC and the industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the one hand and the Information Commissione&#8217;s Office (ICO), on the other is considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in various Parts and Chapters of this Report.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref194" href="#footnote194">194</a></sup> and it is unnecessary to revisit the history.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although the involvement of the PCC has been covered, this has been largely through the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lens of the Information Commissioner. I take this opportunity to review the matter briefly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">through the prism of the PCC.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-3"><a href="#para7-3" name="para7-3">7.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Richard Thomas, the former Information Commissioner, approached the PCC in the belief</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it was the industry regulator. He thus applied to the PCC for assistance in putting a stop</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the use by the press of private investigators using illegal techniques to obtain private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">data. He was hoping, if not expecting, that the PCC might achieve this by way of a general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">condemnation of the practice, and securing appropriate changes to the Editors&#8217; Code.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref195" href="#footnote195">195</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-4"><a href="#para7-4" name="para7-4">7.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Thomas&#8217; belief was a misapprehension that the PCC was a regulator; and, indeed, this was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one of a number of concerns raised by Sir Christopher about the expectations and helpfulness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Information Commissioner. Sir Christopher told the Inquiry that at their first meeting,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in November 2003, Mr Thomas appeared to be labouring under the misapprehension that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC had the ability to enforce the criminal law,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref196" href="#footnote196">196</a></sup> which of course it did not. Even a self-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator properly so called is not able to do that.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">WhilstSirChristopherwasveryclearwithMrThomasthatthePCCcouldnot&#8216;takeover&#8217;specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cases, and that enforcing the law was for statutory bodies, not the PCC,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref197" href="#footnote197">197</a></sup> nonetheless the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC and its representatives appeared keen to present themselves as the<span style="font-style:italic"> de</span><span style="font-style:italic"> facto</span> regulator</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the press and the relevant body for any such discussion. Indeed, it is perhaps telling of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC&#8217;s desire to be regarded as regulator that Sir Christopher made no effort to disabuse Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thomas of this misapprehension immediately.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-6"><a href="#para7-6" name="para7-6">7.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC demonstrated a willingness to play a lead role in dealing with the issue from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press perspective. This was despite the fact that, as Mr Toulmin acknowledged, that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref198" href="#footnote198">198</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;he probably came to the wrong place anyway. I think he&#8217;s accepted that. He either</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should have gone directly to the industry, the trade bodies, or straight to the Code</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Committee, possibly, which is more representative of the industry.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-7"><a href="#para7-7" name="para7-7">7.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Throughout,thepositionofthePCCwasnot,perhaps,asstraightforwardasmightbeexpected</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of an industry body presented with allegations of serious wrongdoing. Sir Christopher was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidently interested in what he heard about Operation Motorman; he characterised the ICO</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as describing a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> fairly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> apocalyptic</span><span style="font-style:italic"> situation</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref199" href="#footnote199">199</a></sup> However, Sir Christopher also wanted firm</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref200" href="#footnote200">200</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I wanted beef. I wanted red meat, Mr Jay, and he didn&#8217;t give it to me.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-8"><a href="#para7-8" name="para7-8">7.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The initial meetings between Mr Thomas and Sir Christopher, in which Sir Christopher asked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for more concrete evidence and Mr Thomas declined to provide it, led to a curious state of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impasse. The lack of will underpinning this slow progress is suggested in remarks made by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Christopher Meyer in response to questions put by Mr Jay as to whether the PCC could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not simply have taken on trust the ICO&#8217;s indication of the extent of the problem without the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">underlying data. Sir Christopher&#8217;s answer was that while, of course, it could be assumed Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thomas would not have made the allegations without some substance, they never saw the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substance, or the expected litigation.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-9"><a href="#para7-9" name="para7-9">7.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The position of the PCC was relatively clear, and remained constant: before they would act,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they wanted details of the underlying data, and decisive action from the ICO.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref201" href="#footnote201">201</a></sup> Furthermore,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC refused to take any action while criminal proceedings were pending or possible. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">added to the inertia.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-10"><a href="#para7-10" name="para7-10">7.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">How they would act should such data be forthcoming was not so clear. It is Sir Christopher&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contention that such evidence would have enabled the PCC to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> gone</span><span style="font-style:italic"> into</span><span style="font-style:italic"> some</span><span style="font-style:italic"> kind</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of action with the newspapers in question<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> sharpen</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> hone</span><span style="font-style:normal"> their</span><span style="font-style:normal"> guidance</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press. Exactly, what such action would have involved is unclear, given the limited powers and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">room for manoeuvre open to the PCC. Certainly the request for concrete evidence sat oddly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the ICO&#8217;s request for forward looking guidance for the press on data protection issues.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Indeed, given the context of the request, it is somewhat surprising that the PCC was not more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">forthcoming with suggestions of practical further steps.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Toulmin said that he was very clearly of the view that the PCC was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> complaints</span><span style="font-style:italic"> body</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">looking at breaches of the code of practice rather than the Data Protection Act<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> suggested</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it may not even have been appropriate for the PCC to have issued any guidance on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Data Protection Act. However, if this view is correct, then it was and remains inappropriate for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC to have held itself out as a regulator and taken the lead in this dialogue. In evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Inquiry Mr Toulmin said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref202" href="#footnote202">202</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The question was, I think, where the different responsibilities lay. The PCC, as a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">platform for discussing the behaviour of journalists and so on in another context,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which was about the application of the code of practice, was happy also to say, &#8216;By</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the way, Richard Thomas has this campaign about the Data Protection Act and he&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">right to do so&#8217;, but beyond that, it was difficult really to know what the PCC could do.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-12"><a href="#para7-12" name="para7-12">7.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Toulmin was undoubtedly right that, even if wrongdoing had been demonstrated, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC was largely powerless to act. However, it is far from clear that this message was ever</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">communicated properly to the ICO, other than in Sir Christopher Meyer&#8217;s veiled suggestion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the ICO do more in this area. Rather, the dialogue between the organisations was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conducted as if it were one of putative regulatory equals. Any acknowledgement that this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not the case came only much later. It is also quite clear that the resulting stalemate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between the two regulatory bodies was to the distinct advantage of the industry: it averted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any further criticism and prevented the scrutiny of what were, in some cases, clearly highly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dubious practices.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-13"><a href="#para7-13" name="para7-13">7.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC did work with the ICO to develop and issue guidance on compliance on the DPA.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It took over 16 months from the first meeting between Mr Thomas and Sir Christopher to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">produce and amounted to no more than three pages of guidance that bore no relation to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;condemnation&#8217; that Mr Thomas had been looking for.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-14"><a href="#para7-14" name="para7-14">7.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The guidance note provides a very basic guide to the ideas contained in the Act.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref203" href="#footnote203">203</a></sup> The bulk</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the note, however, is dedicated to explaining the exemption for journalistic purposes,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including the fact that in considering whether a data controller&#8217;s belief was reasonable that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication was or would be in the public interest, regard may be had by the court to his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compliance with the PCC Code of Practice. It then proceeds to remind the reader of what the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Code says on the public interest and how the PCC has interpreted it. The note does mention</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there is a specific criminal offence of unlawful obtaining of personal data. Moreover no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mention whatsoever is made of the Motorman prosecutions or of the allegations that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press had been substantial customers of those prosecuted.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-15"><a href="#para7-15" name="para7-15">7.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, there is no reference to the risks of using private investigators to obtain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal information or the need to ensure that they do so in accordance with the law. On no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">level could it be suggested that this guidance note was part of a strategy either to condemn</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unlawful data use or to warn the industry of the risks that it might be running. On the contrary,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if anything the guidance note tends towards reassuring the press that there are sufficient</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exemptions for journalistic activity to mean that they need not even think about the issues.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what they might have done in the past?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I would agree with that. I think this guidance note was what we were asked to do</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by the Information Commissioner.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. Did not the PCC form its own view as to what might be appropriate, given what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Information Commissioner was saying about the scale of the activity, namely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what warnings should be given?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Well, this was regarded to be appropriate. There are arguments about whether it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should even have done this, given that it was a complaints body looking at breaches</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the code of practice rather than the Data Protection Act, but it did want to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">helpful and this was the outcome.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-17"><a href="#para7-17" name="para7-17">7.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The inadequacy of this response vividly demonstrates two weaknesses in the PCC&#8217;s approach.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, despite the apparent protection of privacy afforded by clause 3 of the Code of Practice,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the potential widespread use of illegal techniques to secure access to personal data does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not seem to have struck the Commission as a potential breach of the Code. Secondly, this is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a graphic illustration of the inability of the PCC to act as a regulator in any meaningful sense.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These weaknesses in the reaction of the PCC might be explained by the fact that the PCC felt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that on this issue they were unable to act without the consent of the industry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref205" href="#footnote205">205</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-18"><a href="#para7-18" name="para7-18">7.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The efforts made by the PCC did not stop with the issuing of the guidance. Sir Christopher</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also made some speeches in which he touched on the issue.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref206" href="#footnote206">206</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-19"><a href="#para7-19" name="para7-19">7.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, it is not particularly surprising that Mr Thomas was unhappy that the PCC had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not done more. Eventually, on 13 July 2006, there was a meeting between the ICO and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC at which Mr Thomas specifically expressed his disappointment that the PCC had not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been more forthright in its condemnation of what appeared to good evidence of wholesale</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breaches of s55 of the Data Protection Act 1998.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref207" href="#footnote207">207</a></sup> Sir Christopher denied that Mr Thomas&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disappointment was justified, pointing to his speeches, interviews and the PCC&#8217;s Annual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Reviews,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref208" href="#footnote208">208</a></sup> but in my view it was: no formal steps had been taken by the PCC to take up this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue with the industry. Equally, Mr Thomas might well have been disappointed further when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he was informed by Sir Christopher that the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> PCC</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> able</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> act</span><span style="font-style:italic"> as</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> general</span><span style="font-style:italic"> regulator&#8221;</span> ,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the reason for this apparently being:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref209" href="#footnote209">209</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think what I had in mind there was a notion that we should in some way take</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the work of the Information Commissioner by virtue of being a Press Complaints</span>

<a name="page1564"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">complementary way. He did his thing, but there were things that we could do to help</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">him, and I&#8217;ve described them in the &#8211; before lunch. And I think as a consequence of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this precise meeting, it led to direct contacts between the Code Committee and Mr</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Thomas, which led to a change in clause 10 on subterfuge in the code of practice.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-20"><a href="#para7-20" name="para7-20">7.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This introduces a further issue, which relates to the distinction between the PCC and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Editors&#8217; Code of Practice Committee. This was a distinction which, without some words of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explanation from Sir Christopher, appears to have been was completely (and understandably)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lost on Mr Thomas. No such explanation was forthcoming when the matter was first discussed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in November 2003; it was only given in July 2006. Sir Christopher was asked why he did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">himself raise the issue directly with that Committee rather than leaving it to Mr Thomas to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">make direct contact. He replied:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref210" href="#footnote210">210</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...I thought actually this would be helpful. Rather than mediating his contacts with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Code Committee on the matter of clause 10, the very best thing he could do was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to speak to them directly. It was a kind of obvious, common sense practical thing to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">do, to which he raised no objection, and which bore fruit.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. But is this not another example of you adopting a somewhat minimalist approach,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">leaving it to Mr Thomas to have dealings with, in effect, your own Code of Practice</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Committee?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. If that is minimalism, that is a strange concept, considering the amount of effort we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had made to exhort journalists to obey the Data Protection Act, without ever having</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been given evidence of which journalists and which newspapers had committed sins.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">So I think that &#8211; what was this, our third meeting with Mr Thomas, I believe? Yes,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">third. It might have been fourth but I think it was third. It was a thoroughly positive</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and constructive thing to do, which bore fruit.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-21"><a href="#para7-21" name="para7-21">7.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It would have been helpful had Mr Thomas been appropriately advised of the position much</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">earlier. Sir Christopher could and should have raised the matter with the Code Committee</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">shortly after the first meeting in November 2003; alternatively a joint approach could have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been organised.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-22"><a href="#para7-22" name="para7-22">7.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Christopher&#8217;s third concern was that the ICO failed to provide him with hard evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(&#8216;the beef&#8217;) of criminality by individual journalists and titles. This was a point which he had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">developed at some length before the Select Committee, and which was probed before the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry in a series of questions:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref211" href="#footnote211">211</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. The next question and final question on the ICO issue is one which others, I know,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">want me to put. You get the second report. You get the table in the second report. The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Daily Mail happens to be top of the list but maybe it doesn&#8217;t matter precisely who it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is. Why don&#8217;t you call in the editor, or one of the editors or some of the editors near</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the top of the list, and ask for an explanation?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. I was not in the business of calling in editors to explain actions that were perfectly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">legal. The beef had to be an indication of which newspapers and which journalists</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had actually hired inquiry agents to procure information illegally. Then we would</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have been in a different ball game, but we never got there.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. But that&#8217;s a misunderstanding, I think, Sir Christopher, of the table in the second</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">report. The table in the second report evidenced, in Mr Thomas&#8217; view, probably illegal</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref210" name="footnote210" title="Go back to footnote reference 210 in the text">210</a>.  p4, lines 1-20, <em>ibid</em></p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref211" name="footnote211" title="Go back to footnote reference 211 in the text">211</a>.  pp4-5, lines 21-24, <em>ibid</em></p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1565"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">transactions. So the point I&#8217;m putting to you is: on the basis of that table alone and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">assuming that Mr Thomas it is acting in good faith and has evidence, as he must be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">doing, why not call in some editors and ask for an explanation?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. He can have all the good faith in the world, but like the chairman of the Select</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Committee himself, I wanted to see the beef. Then we had something to say to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">editors. And it wasn&#8217;t just me; it was also the Select Committee itself wanted to know</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the answer. He couldn&#8217;t He couldn&#8217;t give it. So by definition, there was a limit to what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could have been done.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-23"><a href="#para7-23" name="para7-23">7.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The ICO&#8217;s second report in particular had clearly explained the basis for the conclusion that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transactions tabulated in Table 6 were likely to be in breach of s55 of the Data Protection Act.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The newspapers at the top of the table were plainly identified for all to see. Sir Christopher</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had enough &#8216;beef&#8217; to take these matters up with the editors involved had he chosen to do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so, but he did not. I regret that I have a very real concern that even had Mr Thomas supplied</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the extra slices of evidential beef which might have satisfied Sir Christopher (by some detail)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">little or nothing would have been done with it, perhaps because of the absence of first hand</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaint. The PCC after all lacked the powers to operate as a &#8216;general regulator&#8217;, and Sir</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Christopher is unlikely to have knocked on the doors of the editors involved seeking their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explanations.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-24"><a href="#para7-24" name="para7-24">7.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In my view, the critical fallout from the Operation Motorman episode is not confined to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ICO; it embraces the PCC, for the reasons I have explained. As a whole, the industry response</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Operation Motorman, led by the PCC, replicated the pattern of disinterest, intransigence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and inertia with which the industry has historically met criticism.</span>

<h3>Phone hacking: what powers did the PCC have and what role should they have played?</h3>


<p id="para-id-7-25"><a href="#para7-25" name="para7-25">7.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Wakeham testified that he did not view it as part of the role of the PCC to investigate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal or potentially criminal allegations. He described the stance taken by the PCC under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his chairmanship as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref212" href="#footnote212">212</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;[I] never considered it was my role to look into allegations of criminality or illegality.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Quite apart from the practical implications of trying to run a quasi-police operation,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we never had the powers to do so. When matters of a suspicious nature came up we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">therefore declined to deal with them and referred them to the relevant authorities to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">take them up.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-26"><a href="#para7-26" name="para7-26">7.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A similar point was made by Baroness Buscombe in her evidence to the Inquiry. She said that</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;What is sometimes lost in this issue is that the PCC, in trying in 2009 to meet rising</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public concern about events at News International exceeded its remit. It is an open</span>

<a name="page1566"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">question as to whether the PCC would now be better placed if it has made publicly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">clear in 2009 that it was in no position sensibly to examine the charges made about</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">News International&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-27"><a href="#para7-27" name="para7-27">7.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This has the appearance of amounting to a form of special pleading. The PCC had previously</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reassured Parliamentarians that the issue of hacking or listening into private conversations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been addressed. In a submission to the CMS Select Committee in 2003, the PCC wrote</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref215" href="#footnote215">215</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;One area of general concern in the early 1990s was the apparent reliance by some</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapersonmaterialthat appearedto havebeenobtainedas a result of bugging or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">eavesdropping on telephone exchanges. Section B 2 [of the submission] outlines how</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Code Committee reacted to this concern by introducing, in 1993, a rule forbidding</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">such practices in the absence of a public interest. Since then only one breach of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Code has been brought to the Commission s attention &#8211; in 1996 &#8211; which clearly shows</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">how the Code can change newspaper behaviour. Since the breach in 1996 there have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been no others&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-28"><a href="#para7-28" name="para7-28">7.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is no reason why in principle the PCC should not have investigated or sought to publish</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a report into allegations of phone hacking. There were no pitfalls so long as the PCC was clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and open about the extent of the powers it had, the extent of the investigations it was able</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to carry out, and the nature of the investigations it had carried out.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-29"><a href="#para7-29" name="para7-29">7.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The 2007 and 2009 investigations, leading to the reports respectively entitled &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Report</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">suffered from similar flaws. Ignoring the issue as to its ability to obtain accurate answers,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC did not ask the right questions to discover the true extent of the practice of phone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking, or whether it was more widespread than had previously emerged; neither did it pay</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficient attention to evidence which suggested that what was being asserted was not the full</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">picture. In both reports, the PCC concluded that there was no evidence that phone hacking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was widespread, when at best it should have expressed itself in far more non-committal (if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not wholly non committal) terms. In the 2009 report, there was the additional feature of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">belittling of those who were contending that hacking was widespread.</span>
<h3>2007 investigation</h3>

<p id="para-id-7-30"><a href="#para7-30" name="para7-30">7.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC made a press statement on phone hacking in August 2006. In that statement the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC made it clear that, in line with Article 53(3)(c) of its Articles of Association, it would not</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 1 February 2007 the PCC announced the action that it would be taking following the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conviction of Messrs Goodman and Mulcaire.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref218" href="#footnote218">218</a></sup> Sir Christopher Meyer announced that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC would be taking steps to ensure that the public could be satisfied<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> lessons</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> been</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">learned from this episode, both at the newspaper and more generally&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref219" href="#footnote219">219</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> The</span><span style="font-style:normal"> PCC</span><span style="font-style:normal"> committed</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to explore three things:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;First, we are writing to the new editor of the News of the World with a number</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of questions, including what he will be doing to ensure that the situation involving</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire does not recur. Second, we will be writing to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">editors of national and regional newspapers and magazines to find out the extent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of internal controls aimed at preventing intrusive fishing expeditions; and what is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">being done to instil understanding both of the Code of Practice and the law in this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">area, and also of journalistic public interest exemptions. The Data Protection Act has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an obvious relevance here. Third, the board of the Commission will consider these</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">industry responses with a view to publishing a review of the current situation, with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recommendations for best practice if necessary, in order to prevent a similar situation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">arising in the future. This is in line with its duty to promote high professional standards</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of journalism.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-32"><a href="#para7-32" name="para7-32">7.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The 2007 investigation was primarily forward looking. The PCC did not set out to discover</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether the type of illegal activity which Messrs Goodman and Mulcaire had engaged in was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more widespread than the activity of a single rogue reporter in a single newspaper.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-33"><a href="#para7-33" name="para7-33">7.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC chose not to engage in a more wide-ranging investigation despite the sentencing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remarks of Mr Justice Gross which referred to contact between Mr Mulcaire and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> others</span> &#8221; at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the News of the World;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref220" href="#footnote220">220</a></sup> and the allegation from the Daily Mail that Mr Mulcaire was being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">paid &#163;200,000 per annum by the NoTW.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref221" href="#footnote221">221</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-34"><a href="#para7-34" name="para7-34">7.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As a first step in the investigation, Mr Tim Toulmin wrote to Mr Myler on 7 February 2007.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref222" href="#footnote222">222</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He asked Mr Myler a series of questions arising from the prosecution of Mr Goodman and Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire. There was a particular focus on whether or not the employment of a third party,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">i.e. Mr Mulcaire, had been an attempt to circumvent the provisions of the Editors&#8217; Code of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Conduct. The questioning also focussed on whether internal procedures had been tightened</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">up since the detection of Mr Goodman&#8217;s activities, to prevent any repeat. In line with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">general approach of this investigation, Mr Toulmin&#8217;s letter did not seek to explore whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the practice of phone hacking or any other invasions of privacy was more widespread within</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the NoTW than had previously emerged.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-35"><a href="#para7-35" name="para7-35">7.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">While the PCC questions were not directed to the question of whether phone hacking was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more widespread than had previously emerged, Mr Myler took pains to emphasise that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">phone hacking was an activity engaged in only by Mr Goodman:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref223" href="#footnote223">223</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Although, as I said earlier, there can be no question of complacency, this was an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">exceptional and unhappy event in the 163 years of history of News of the World,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">involving one journalist.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been engaged by the NoTW to carry out legitimate searches and investigations, and then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">retained separately by Mr Goodman to carry out illegal phone hacking.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref225" href="#footnote225">225</a></sup> Mr Myler further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">asserted that the illegal aspect of Mr Mulcaire&#8217;s activities had been completely unknown to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">anyone at the NoTW other than Mr Goodman.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref226" href="#footnote226">226</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-37"><a href="#para7-37" name="para7-37">7.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC did not interview the former editor of the NoTW, Andy Coulson, in its preparation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the 2007 report or indeed ask him to provide written evidence to the investigation. It is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">surprising that the PCC was content to direct its questions at Mr Myler, a man who had only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken over as editor of the NoTW a matter of weeks before answering the PCC&#8217;s questions;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had never worked there before, and until he took over as editor of the NoTW had been living</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and working in New York. In the 2007 report, the reason given for the failure to interview or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">otherwise question Mr Coulson was that he had resigned from the editorship of the NoTW</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and therefore no longer came under the PCC&#8217;s jurisdiction:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref227" href="#footnote227">227</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Given that the PCC does not &#8211; and should not &#8211; have statutory powers of investigation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and prosecution, there could be no question of trying to duplicate the lengthy police</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation. Furthermore, Mr Coulson was, following his resignation, no longer</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">answerable to the PCC, whose jurisdiction covers journalists working for publications</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that subscribe to the self-regulatory system through the Press Standards Board of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">Finance.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-38"><a href="#para7-38" name="para7-38">7.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first of these points may go to the question of what the PCC should investigate, and how it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should do so. It has no bearing on whether or not Mr Coulson should have been interviewed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or otherwise questioned. The second point, that Mr Coulson was no longer employed by a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">publication subscribing to PressBoF, has no merit either. There was nothing to prevent the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC from asking Mr Coulson to answer questions, even after he had left the employment of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a newspaper. The PCC had previously asked questions of journalists after their dismissal, for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">example in the City Slickers investigation where the PCC approached both journalists, James</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Hipwell and Anil Bhoyrul for information after they had been dismissed by the Daily Mirror.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref228" href="#footnote228">228</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Brian Cubbon, the PCC&#8217;s Charter Commissioner, recommended Mr Toulmin in an email on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1 May 2007 that Mr Coulson should be interviewed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref229" href="#footnote229">229</a></sup> If Mr Coulson had declined to answer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">questions the PCC might have drawn inferences from that refusal.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-39"><a href="#para7-39" name="para7-39">7.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In evidence to the Inquiry Sir Christopher said that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> might</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> been</span><span style="font-style:italic"> presentationally</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not say that he believed that the 2007 report would have been better in substance.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is surprising that Sir Christopher did not believe that it would have been better from a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantive perspective had the PCC interviewed Mr Coulson. Any investigator determined to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arrive at the truth would have wished to interview the editor of the newspaper at which the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">alleged wrongdoing took place.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-40"><a href="#para7-40" name="para7-40">7.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The process of the investigation revealed the extent to which the PCC&#8217;s capacity to operate as</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I remain wary, as calling newspapers generally to account like that strikes me as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">entering into another level of regulation. Fine if the industry wants it, but we don&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">want to alienate everybody! If we do say something, my suggestion would be</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the failure to draw upon material which might have indicated otherwise, at least inferentially,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the 2007 report purported to come to conclusions about the prevalence of phone hacking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within the industry:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref232" href="#footnote232">232</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC also used the report as an opportunity to continue its advocacy against the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">introduction of custodial sentences for breaches of s55 of the Data Protection Act. Having</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Commission believes very strongly that the impact of these initiatives should</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be assessed before the government proceeds with its proposals to increase the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">penalties for journalists who breach the DPA to two years in prison. Such a move</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would be difficult to reconcile with notions of press freedom. The mere threat of a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">custodial sentence could be enough to deter journalists from embarking on legitimate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigations, despite reassurances about the public interest exemptions from the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Press Complaints Commission has effectively cleared the News of the World of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any illegal conspiracy in the Clive Goodman royal phone hacking scandal.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-45"><a href="#para7-45" name="para7-45">7.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The effect of the PCC&#8217;s 2007 report was to take the heat out of calls for further investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or reform of the system of self-regulation. In November 2007 Sir Christopher wrote to Tim</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Bowdler, then Chairman of PressBoF, in the following terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref237" href="#footnote237">237</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I have to say that &#8230; I was extremely worried by the possible political fall-out from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Goodman/Mulcaire case and the damage this could do to self-regulation. [The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">PCC&#8217;s report into Subterfuge and Newsgathering] put a premium on responding</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fast, comprehensively and effectively. Despite some carping at our decision not to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interview Andy Coulson, the report has gone down well, effectively killing the case as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an issue in Westminster and Whitehall. It has, as you know, been welcomed by the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Government, the Opposition and the Select Committee; and, I believe, has contributed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the current and welcome bipartisan consensus behind self-regulation and against</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a privacy law, buttressed by the Prime Minister himself.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-46"><a href="#para7-46" name="para7-46">7.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is frankly difficult to avoid the conclusion that with the publication of the Report on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Subterfuge and Newsgathering, not only was yet another chance for the self-regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system to reform itself was missed, but the PCC actively attempted to avoid external scrutiny</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that might have increased pressure for reform of the system from elsewhere.</span>

<h3>2009 investigation</h3>

<p id="para-id-7-47"><a href="#para7-47" name="para7-47">7.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 9 July 2009, the Guardian published an article entitled &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Revealed:</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Murdoch&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#163;1m</span><span style="font-style:italic"> bill</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">had paid over the odds to settle phone hacking cases in order to try to secure confidentiality.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The article revealed that one of the cases involved Gordon Taylor, the former Chief Executive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Professional Footballers Association. In a separate comment piece printed in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Guardian on the same day, Mr Davies challenged the &#8216;one rogue reporter&#8217; defence which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been advanced by News Group Newspapers (NGN) since the allegations about Clive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Goodman&#8217;s conduct were revealed.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-48"><a href="#para7-48" name="para7-48">7.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In response to the allegations, the PCC issued a press statement announcing that it would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seek further information about the allegations from the Guardian and from the Information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref239" href="#footnote239">239</a></sup> The PCC did so and eventually prepared a report based on those findings</span>

<a name="page1571"></a><!--new page--><h4>Why the PCC investigated</h4>

<p id="para-id-7-49"><a href="#para7-49" name="para7-49">7.49</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By 2009, senior figures at the PCC felt obliged to try to assume the responsibilities of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulator in relation to the phone hacking allegations which had, by then, grown in volume.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Baroness Buscombe gave evidence that she felt obliged to make some sort of intervention</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because there was nobody else able to fulfil that role:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref242" href="#footnote242">242</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Q. &#8230;you might have said &#8216;This is really only a complaints mechanism. This is nothing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">about regulation&#8217;&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A&#8230;at the time we felt that we did have a regulatory role&#8230;to perform. There was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nothing else. There were no other layers that were, at the time, coming into play&#8221;.</span>
<h4>The Investigation</h4>

<p id="para-id-7-50"><a href="#para7-50" name="para7-50">7.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The 2009 report sought to answer two questions. First, whether the PCC had been misled</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when preparing the 2007 report and in particular whether there was any evidence that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">phone hacking was not confined to the single rogue reporter, Mr Goodman, acting through</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the agency of Mr Mulcaire. Secondly, the PCC sought to establish whether there was any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence that phone message tapping had occurred since 2007.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-51"><a href="#para7-51" name="para7-51">7.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Toulmin wrote Mr Myler on two occasions in the course of the 2009 investigation: on 27</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">July 2009<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref243" href="#footnote243">243</a></sup> and 3 September 2009.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref244" href="#footnote244">244</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-52"><a href="#para7-52" name="para7-52">7.52</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first letter asked a series of questions which included references to: (a) the sentencing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remarks of Mr Justice Gross in which the judge referred to Mr Mulcaire dealing with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals at News International (NI) other than Mr Goodman; (b) the &#8216;for Neville&#8217; email; (c)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">internal investigations at the NoTW following the arrest of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2006; (d) payments in relation to information supplied by Mr Mulcaire about Gordon Taylor;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) whether the NoTW still believed that the &#8216;single rogue reporter&#8217; line was the correct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interpretation of events.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-53"><a href="#para7-53" name="para7-53">7.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Myler sent a response on behalf of NGN by letter dated 5 August 2009.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref245" href="#footnote245">245</a></sup> The substance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Mr Myler&#8217;s response was that the NoTW still believed that phone message tapping was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the act of a single rogue reporter. Mr Myler dealt with the &#8216;for Neville&#8217; email in the following</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref246" href="#footnote246">246</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Our internal enquiries have found no evidence of involvement by News of the World</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">staff other than Clive Goodman in phone message interception beyond the email</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">transcript which emerged in April 2008 during the Gordon Taylor litigation and which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">has since been revealed in the original Guardian report&#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Email searches of relevant people, particularly the junior reporter [who sent the &#8216;for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Neville&#8217; email], [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] failed to show any trace of the email</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">being sent to or received by any other News of the World staff member.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Those who might have been connected to the relevant story, particularly [REDACTED]</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and [REDACTED], denied ever having seen or knowing about the relevant email and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">no evidence has been found which contradicts these assertions.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Later in the same letter, Mr Myler responded to the direct question about why an email with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the transcript of a message from Mr Taylor&#8217;s phone was entitled &#8216;for Neville&#8217;. Mr Myler gave</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the following response:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref247" href="#footnote247">247</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;From June 2001 to April 2003 [REDACTED]...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">During that time Glenn Mulcaire was hired to provide numerous services including</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">land registry checks, credit status checks, electoral roll checks, directorship searches,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">court record checks, surveillance, and the provision of telephone numbers of sports</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">stars from his vast database of personal contacts.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-55"><a href="#para7-55" name="para7-55">7.55</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is surprising that Mr Myler&#8217;s reply did not prompt further enquiries by the PCC. Given the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ongoing criminal investigations, it is inappropriate for me to be too specific, but to explain the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;for Neville&#8217; email in the context of Mr Mulcaire&#8217;s supposedly legitimate work for the NoTW</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appears to make little sense, given that there was the transcript of a hacked phone message</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attached. The failure to pick up on the inadequacy of this response and to seek to probe</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further was a clear flaw in the PCC&#8217;s investigation.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-56"><a href="#para7-56" name="para7-56">7.56</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC asked about Mr Justice Gross&#8217;s sentencing remarks both in the first letter dated 27</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">July 2009 and in the second letter dated 3 September 2009. In his letter of 5 August, Mr Myler</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gave a short response to the point, saying that the NoTW could not explain to what Mr Justice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Gross was referring.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref248" href="#footnote248">248</a></sup> In his reply to the second letter, Mr Myler simply said that Mr Mulcaire</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had had contact with several NoTW reporters on the point.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref249" href="#footnote249">249</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-57"><a href="#para7-57" name="para7-57">7.57</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC did not have power to compel anyone to disclose relevant documents or to gain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">access to relevant records. Nor did they ask for any such documents or access. Further, when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigating whether or not they had been misled in 2007, the PCC relied on the honesty and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thoroughness of executives at the organisation alleged to have misled them.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-58"><a href="#para7-58" name="para7-58">7.58</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC press release covering the publication of the 2009 report, issued on 9 November</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2009, contained the following paragraph:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref250" href="#footnote250">250</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The PCC received information from a number of sources. It found no evidence that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it was materially misled by the News of the World, and no evidence that phone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">message hacking is ongoing. The Guardian&#8217;s sources suggesting a greater culture of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">intrusion at the News of the World were anonymous and could not be tested, while the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Commission noted that there were &#8216;a significant number of on the record statements</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from those who have conducted inquiries, and have first-hand knowledge of events</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at the newspaper&#8217; who were prepared to state a contrary position.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-59"><a href="#para7-59" name="para7-59">7.59</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition to asking questions of Mr Myler, the PCC also asked for evidence from the solicitor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MarkLewis,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref251" href="#footnote251">251</a></sup> fromMrDavies,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref252" href="#footnote252">252</a></sup> fromMickGorrilloftheInformationCommissioner&#8217;sOffice,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref253" href="#footnote253">253</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and from Mark Maberly, the policeman with whom Mr Lewis had had a conversation about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the extent of phone hacking.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref254" href="#footnote254">254</a></sup> Mr Maberly did not respond. The PCC also had access to the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC also relied upon the public statements of Assistant Commissioners John Yates and</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking victims was set against the evidence from, among others, Mr Lewis that there had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been up to 6,000.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref257" href="#footnote257">257</a></sup> Of course, the number of alleged victims was closely linked to the issue</span>

<p id="para-id-7-61"><a href="#para7-61" name="para7-61">7.61</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Davies, among other things, told the PCC that he was not able to reveal all of the sources</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of his stories about the extent of phone hacking because of the fear voiced by some people</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when dealing with a powerful organisation such as NI.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref258" href="#footnote258">258</a></sup> Mr Gorrill was not able to supply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC with information flowing from the Motorman investigation because the information</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC did not ask for disclosure of documents from the NoTW, or any other form of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">documentary evidence. Whereas there was no formal power allowing the PCC to demand</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disclosure of key documents from NGN, there was nothing to stop the PCC asking to see such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">documents. Had NGN refused, it was open to the PCC to make that public, and take any such</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">News of the World executives knew about Goodman and Mulcaire&#8217;s activities. It</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">follows that there is nothing to suggest that the PCC was materially misled during its</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of these factors). Whatever the reason, there did not seem to be anything concrete to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">support the implication that there had been a hitherto concealed criminal conspiracy</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC might reasonably have concluded that there was insufficient evidence for it firmly</span>

<p id="para-id-7-67"><a href="#para7-67" name="para7-67">7.67</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first of these facts was the so called &#8216;for Neville&#8217; email. The second was Mr Taylor&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">settlement which was for a very large (some might say an astonishingly large) sum. Third,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence from Mr Lewis of his conversation with a police officer suggesting that phone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">message tapping was much more widespread than had previously been made public. Fourth,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there were the sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Gross in the Goodman and Mulcaire</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecution (to which one might add the words of both prosecuting and defence counsel).</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It would have been reasonable for the PCC to conclude that none of these facts, taken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individually or collectively, proved for certain that it had been misled in the course of their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2007 investigation, but there was certainly reason to believe that it might have been.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;there is no evidence that the practice of phone message tapping is ongoing.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">anything, but on the other hand if we&#8217;d done nothing we would have been accused of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rusbridger, resigned from the Editors&#8217; Code Committee in protest. Mr Davies gave evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the 2009 report caused him to change from being a supporter of the self-regulatory</span>

<a name="page1575"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We published the Gordon Taylor story in July, and in November, the PCC published</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the second report on phone hacking. Different personnel, different chair. The former</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8211; well, I think the same director, but the man who is now director was involved in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">production of that report, Stephen Abell, who I regard as a good man.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">But the report was terrible. Just an awful piece of work. You know, my editor resigned</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from the code committee in protest. He went on the radio and said, &#8216;This is worse than</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">useless&#8217;, which I think was an understatement. And that shifted me across the line. I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">just think &#8211; I do not trust this industry to regulate itself. I say this as I love reporting. I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">want us to be free &#8230; But it obviously doesn&#8217;t work. We&#8217;re kidding ourselves if we think</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it would, because it hasn&#8217;t.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Q. This is the report, which is no longer on the PCC website, which referred to, I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">paraphrase, some of the Guardian&#8217;s more dramatic claims not being borne out by the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">evidence or words to that effect?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A. Yes, and along the way there was some slippery behaviour, slippery handling of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">evidence.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-71"><a href="#para7-71" name="para7-71">7.71</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thus the effect of the 2009 investigation was to alienate and anger the sole newspaper which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had taken this issue seriously. The report and a subsequent speech by Baroness Buscombe to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Society of Editors,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref267" href="#footnote267">267</a></sup> also angered Mr Taylor&#8217;s former solicitor Mr Lewis to the extent that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he successfully pursued proceedings for libel.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-72"><a href="#para7-72" name="para7-72">7.72</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It was not too late, even in 2009, for the PCC to have been more open with the public and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to have said that it lacked the powers and was not competent to carry out an effective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation into allegations of phone hacking. That would have avoided the danger that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">politicians, the public and potential claimants might conclude that a competent regulator had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigated the allegations and found them to be baseless. It is completely unconvincing to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contend that the PCC had to be seen to do something in order to maintain public confidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the self-regulatory system. There was no public interest in the PCC purporting to exonerate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the NoTW when it did not have the proper evidence to do so, still less to uphold the values</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of self-regulation. In particular as regards the disparaging conclusion about the Guardian,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC was clearly taking an enormous risk. That risk was that the situation would speedily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unravel against it if (as happened) it was contradicted by subsequent events.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-73"><a href="#para7-73" name="para7-73">7.73</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The immediate consequence of the PCC&#8217;s failed investigation, as with the 2007 report, was to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dampen down calls for further investigation. The continued pursuit of the issue by journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such as Mr Davies, solicitors like Mr Lewis and a handful of politicians meant that the issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would not be buried. However, the PCC&#8217;s contribution to the phone hacking saga seeped</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into the political arena: for example, the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon David Cameron MP, gave</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence that in deciding to employ Mr Coulson, he relied in part on the reports of the PCC.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref268" href="#footnote268">268</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC has been seen to associate itself with the interests of the press, has lobbied for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press on key policy issues, and has acted as a shield against moves which might threaten the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been deployed as a substitute for real, substantial reform which might have improved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press standards and provided a real basis for trust in self-regulation. The PCC has expressed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a willingness to listen to constructive criticism but has consistently displayed a reluctance to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">act upon it.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-4"><a href="#para8-4" name="para8-4">8.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The failure by the PCC to initiate its own investigations &#8211; other than in circumstances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">where an investigation was needed to head off criticism of the press or self-regulation &#8211; or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to accept complaints from third parties across the board and on a transparent basis, has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meant that the PCC is not able to act as a regulator properly so called. It has also meant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that bodies representing the interests of groups or minorities cannot complain to the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about discriminatory or inaccurate coverage. These are points which have been repeatedly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identified as a weakness in the self-regulatory system.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-5"><a href="#para8-5" name="para8-5">8.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The failure by the PCC to investigate where press actions might give rise to a criminal charge or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">civil claim is a limitation on its effectiveness. The resources of the police are limited; similarly,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resource restraints mean that individuals often cannot afford to proceed with a civil action.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Even where there were<span style="font-style:italic"> prima</span><span style="font-style:italic"> facie</span> serious breaches of the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice, the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">typically failed to take any steps to investigate. Examples of this (including alleged payments</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to police officers) emerged before the CMS Select Committee in their hearings leading to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2003 report, and the Select Committee at that stage made clear its view that the PCC should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigate allegations of this type.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref272" href="#footnote272">272</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-6"><a href="#para8-6" name="para8-6">8.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When the PCC failed to initiate an investigation over newspaper coverage of the McCann</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case, once again the CMS Select Committee criticised the PCC for this failure.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref273" href="#footnote273">273</a></sup> That report</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concluded:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref274" href="#footnote274">274</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In any other industry suffering such a collective breakdown &#8211; as for example in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">banking sector now &#8211; any regulator worth its salt would have instigated an enquiry.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The press, indeed, would have been clamouring for it to do so. It is an indictment on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the PCC&#8217;s record, that it signally failed to do so.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC does not have sufficient powers to investigate alleged breaches of the Code. As the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions concluded, this meant that the PCC &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">equipped to deal with systemic and illegal invasions of privacy&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref275" href="#footnote275">275</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> In</span><span style="font-style:normal"> particular,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> it</span><span style="font-style:normal"> does</span><span style="font-style:normal"> not</span><span style="font-style:normal"> have</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">powers to demand the production of documents or to run investigations which strike at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">heart of complaints. At every step it has to trust that newspapers are properly examining the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues and are not being economical with the truth. In relation to its investigations into phone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking, it is common ground that it was misled. In addition and in any event, it did not use the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">powers which it had to best effect. For example, it did not initiate investigations as often as it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might have done nor did it hold oral hearings to determine cases, despite having the power to.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Once again, these points were picked up in the CMS Select Committee&#8217;s 2003 Report.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref276" href="#footnote276">276</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-8"><a href="#para8-8" name="para8-8">8.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The weaknesses in the PCC&#8217;s powers and its reluctance to seek to compel newspapers to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">get to the truth were exposed by its inaction after the ICO&#8217;s reports arising from Operation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Motorman, and in the 2007 and 2009 reports into phone hacking.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-9"><a href="#para8-9" name="para8-9">8.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC does not have adequate sanctions to dissuade newspapers from repeating their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">transgressions and satisfy complainants that the wrongs against them have been redressed.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Negotiated apologies, published adjudications and letters to proprietors are not in themselves</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adequate to prevent reoffending. The lack of a power to fine, even in relation to serious and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">systemic breaches of the code, has meant that the PCC is not a body whose adjudications</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have force against the industry.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-10"><a href="#para8-10" name="para8-10">8.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These points have been consistently picked up in external reviews of the PCC&#8217;s performance.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The CMS Select Committee&#8217;s 2003 report recommended that a system of fines be introduced,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as well as a strengthening of the sanctions already in place.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref277" href="#footnote277">277</a></sup> The CMS Select Committee&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2007 report into self-regulation of the press also heard evidence that some complaints were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not satisfied with the strength of sanctions; that there were not enough adjudications given, as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">distinct from negotiated settlements; and recommended that the issue of fines be considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref278" href="#footnote278">278</a></sup> The failure to identify for public consumption the number of breaches of the Code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the PCC concluded had occurred serves to preserve an erroneous impression of the level</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of compliance with the Code.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-11"><a href="#para8-11" name="para8-11">8.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition, the evidence overall demonstrates that complainants to the PCC tend to feel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressurised into accepting a negotiated settlement rather than having a decision made on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether or not there has been a breach of the Editors&#8217; Code. This failing was identified by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">witnesses who gave evidence to the CMS Select Committee in preparation for their 2003</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">report:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref279" href="#footnote279">279</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There was a great deal of praise for the staff of the Commission in assisting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">complainants through the process but there was also a backdrop of frustration that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nothing was going to change and nothing was going to happen to an offending</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspaper. In one case, the witness encapsulated the feelings of many in saying</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that, even though she had, eventually, won the argument and got an apology, she</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The Daily Mail, which was to publish an apology on page 31.&#8217; This experience seems</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at odds with the PCC&#8217;s stated policy that &#8216;complainants can of course at any stage</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ask the Commission itself to take a formal view on their complaint&#8217; Another witness</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">described the complaints process as like climbing a staircase with &#8216;the Commission&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as the &#8216;big thing in the sky&#8217;. However, he told us &#8216;You get to the top of the steps, you</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">are looking around, and &#8216;it&#8217; is not there&#8217;&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-12"><a href="#para8-12" name="para8-12">8.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The failings which have fatally undermined the PCC and caused policy makers and the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to lose trust in the self-regulatory system are not new. They have been consistently identified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by external scrutiny for at least a decade. The twin failure of both the self-regulatory system</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the industry to address these problems is itself evidence that there has been no real</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appetite for an effective and adequate system of regulation from within the industry, in spite</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a professed openness to reform and self-criticism. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the self-regulatory system was run for the benefit of the press not of the public.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-13"><a href="#para8-13" name="para8-13">8.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the circumstances, it is not surprising that change is inevitable. On 9 March 2012, there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was a press release to the effect that the PCC had unanimously agreed in principle to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposal that it will now move into a transitional phase, transferring its assets, liabilities and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">staff to a new regulatory body.</span>
