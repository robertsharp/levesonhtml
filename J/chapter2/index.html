<h1>CHAPTER 2<br/>THE CRIMINAL LAW</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The criminal law can touch upon the work of journalists in many ways and inevitably</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prescribes the ways in which it is acceptable for stories to be obtained. A detailed summary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of aspects of the criminal law most likely to be engaged in the pursuit of journalism is set out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in Appendix 4 but it is not intended to be comprehensive: by way of example, aspects of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behaviour of Neville Thurlbeck as he pursued a follow up to his scoop relating to Max Mosley</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were described by Mr Justice Eady as containing &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> clear</span><span style="font-style:italic"> threat</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> women</span><span style="font-style:italic"> involved</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the unprincipled pursuit of a story.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the basis that what was believed to have taken place at the News of the World (NoTW)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(ignoring what might have happened elsewhere) consisted of the commission of crime, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been suggested that this Inquiry is unnecessary, if not misconceived. It is argued that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the problem, if such there was, did not lie with the press but with the police for their failure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to investigate crime; furthermore, because of the existence of the criminal law, these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues simply do not require further attention in general or regulation in particular. Without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attempting to list all of those who have developed the same argument, it is worth mentioning</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">three different ways in which the point has been articulated.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, in one of the seminars prior to the commencement of the hearings during the course of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an address concerned with defending free expression, Kelvin MacKenzie, the former editor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of The Sun, said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Yes there was criminal cancer at the News of The World. Yes there were editorial and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">senior management errors as the extent of the cancer began to be revealed. But why</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">do we need an inquiry of this kind?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There are plenty of laws to cover what went on. After all 16 people have already been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">arrested and my bet is that the number may well go to 30 once police officers are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rounded up.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Almost certainly they will face conspiracy laws, corruption laws, false accounting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">laws. There are plenty of laws that have been broken. Lord Leveson knows them all</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">by heart.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Supposing these arrests didn&#8217;t come from the newspaper business. Supposing they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were baggage handlers at Heathrow nicking from luggage, or staff at Primark</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">carrying out a VAT swindle, or more likely, a bunch or lawyers involved in a mortgage</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fraud would such an inquiry have ever been set up.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">Of course not.&#8221;</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref1" name="footnote1" title="Go back to footnote reference 1 in the text">1</a>.  paras 82 and 87,<em> Mosley v News Group Newspapers Ltd</em> [2008] EWHC QB 1777</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref2" name="footnote2" title="Go back to footnote reference 2 in the text">2</a>.  p2, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Kelvin-MacKenzie.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1480"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ian Hislop, the Editor of Private Eye, put the matter in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I do think that statutory regulation is not required, and most of the heinous crimes</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that came up and have made such a splash in front of this Inquiry have already</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been illegal. Contempt of court is illegal. Phone tapping is illegal. Taking money</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from &#8211; policemen taking money is illegal. All of these things don&#8217;t need a code. We</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">already have laws for them. The fact that these laws were not rigorously enforced</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is, again, due to the behaviour of the police, the interaction of the police and News</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">International, and &#8211; I mean, let&#8217;s be honest about this &#8211; the fact that our politicians</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have been very, very involved, in ways that I think are not sensible, with senior News</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">International people ...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, the Rt Hon Michael Gove MP said exactly the same thing:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I have a prior belief that we should use the existing laws of the land and individuals</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and institutions should be judged fairly, on the basis of the existing laws of the land &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">... and that the case for regulation needs to be made very strongly before we further</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">curtail liberty. ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think the best way of making sure that people obey the law is making sure that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">police are appropriately resourced to investigate crime, that the courts hear the case</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for the prosecution and the defence and then, if someone is found guilty, that they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">face the consequences. I fear for liberty if those principles are eroded.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The argument goes in this way. If a journalist intercepted a message on somebody else&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mobile telephone, without their permission, that journalist has committed a criminal offence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and should be investigated and, if appropriate, prosecuted in exactly the same way as would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occur if anybody else did the same thing. Journalists should be subject to the same law as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">everyone else but should not be subject to any additional regulatory restriction when all that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">each one is doing is exercising his or her right to free speech. A subsidiary argument (also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advanced by a number of witnesses) goes further. Far from imposing additional regulation on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the journalist, the importance of free speech and the obligation of the press to hold power to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">account should be recognised in the criminal law, so that, if a journalist is acting in the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest in pursuing a story, he or she has a defence to any crime necessarily committed while</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">doing so. The defence to a breach of s55 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA), along with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the unimplemented amendments contained within the ss77-78 of the Criminal Justice and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Immigration Act 2008, is discussed later, but the argument is that no journalist should be in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">peril of conviction of crime while pursuing a story in the public interest (or, presumably, while</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pursuing a story that he or she perceives to be in the public interest).</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These arguments fail to recognise the way in which the criminal law operates and the practical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">limitations facing the police and prosecuting authorities, however enthusiastic their wish to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">detectallthosecommittingcriminaloffencesmightbe.ThewayinwhichOperationMotorman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was pursued by the Information Commissioner and Operation Caryatid (later reconsidered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on a number of occasions) by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) has been the subject</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of detailed analysis.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> At this stage, the intention is not to consider the specific investigations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(although some aspects will be identified where relevant) but rather to examine the over-</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">arching constraints which face the police and the courts in the investigation, detection and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecution of crime in general and crime involving journalists in particular.</span>

<h2>2. The investigation of crime: complaints to the police</h2>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Crimes come to be notified to the police and investigated in a number of different ways.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First and most likely is that a complaint of crime or possible crime is made to the police. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">victim of, say, a burglary or a robbery will contact the police and report the matter. Equally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">plausible is that the police will be notified in the event that the victim of, say, a shooting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attends hospital. Alternatively, the police might themselves either be called to the scene of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a crime (whether by a victim or witness) or they might be present and witness events for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">themselves (such as might occur during an occasion of public disorder). This report might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be immediate and contemporaneous with events; it might follow after days (a burglary only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">detected when the householder returns home after holiday); after weeks or months (fraud);</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or even after many years (historic sexual abuse). Howsoever it occurs, the police will then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">take statements from witnesses and pursue such investigations as they can. An inquiry might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involve scenes of crime officers, forensic scientists or other experts; it might involve the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">collection of documentary or other real evidence; it might involve the pursuit of information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from those who might know who is responsible. Leads will be followed up and, in the most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complex cases, a computer system such as HOLMES<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> used to collate evidence and ensure that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all appropriate avenues are explored.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, for some criminal offences (and, in particular, for some of the most serious and those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which do not generate victims likely to complain to the police), rather than wait for a possible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">victim, the police will target either an offence or a suspected offender. By way of example,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">large scale supply of Class A drugs may well be detected because of some intelligence leading</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to surveillance and the development of evidence in that way. Police resources may well be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">devoted to target serious criminal activity without waiting for the crime to be committed. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this type of case, however, again, evidence will be followed up, collated and researched in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the same way.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whatever might have drawn the attention of the police either to the crime or the alleged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal, many of the same investigative techniques will be deployed in order to bring those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">guilty of crime before the courts. Thus, during the course of an investigation for an indictable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offence, a search warrant or search warrants can be obtained and the relevant evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seized.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> Additionally, assuming reasonable grounds can be established that an indictable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offence has been committed, a suspect may be arrested and, pursuant to s18 PACE, the police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can search any premises occupied or controlled by that person both in relation to that offence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and any other indictable offence connected with or similar to that offence.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Once lawfully on premises being searched, the police can seize anything which the officer has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasonable grounds for believing has been obtained in consequence of the commission of an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offence (to prevent it being lost damaged, altered or destroyed), along with anything which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the officer has reasonable grounds for believing constitutes evidence in relation to an offence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being investigated or any other offence.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> When it comes to journalistic material, there are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very important restrictions to these powers which shall require detailed consideration but, for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the present, it is sufficient to identify the possibility that these searches (and any interviews</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">similarly conducted pursuant to powers in PACE) may reveal further evidence.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">This very potted and non-exhaustive summary<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> is important simply because it underlines the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">vital importance of what constitutes the trigger for a police investigation. In the first case,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was the complaint of the victim or other knowledge that a crime had been committed.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the second, it was the intelligence or suspicion that crime was in train. Something had to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">start the investigative ball rolling. Even for the least serious criminal offences, there has to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be something. Speeding is now detected with the use of specific speed cameras; the use of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mobile telephone when driving, or failure to wear a seat belt, however, are only detected if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">someone (usually a police officer but, perhaps for some offences, a traffic warden) sees the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offence being committed and does something about it.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Turning to the offences which may be committed by journalists in pursuit of a story, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">absence of a victim who is aware of the fact of the offence means that there will be no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaint. Neither can reliance be placed on the possibility that a complaint might be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generated which will reveal what has been going on sufficiently to expose all such criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wrongdoing. Both in Operation Motorman and Operation Caryatid, what was significant was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not the original complaint (in the first case relating to the passing on of information from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the DVLA and, in the second, relating to personal details concerning a member of the Royal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Household of sufficient significance itself to cause a substantial police investigation to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undertaken). Rather, it was the entirely fortuitous discovery of a mountain of information in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the form of the records kept by Steve Whittamore and Glenn Mulcaire respectively.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Without those records, nobody would have been any the wiser about the extent to which Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whittamore was providing personal data in clear breach of s55 of the DPA and the subsequent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exposures would never have seen the light of day. Without the many pages of Mr Mulcaire&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">records, the fact that names, addresses, phone numbers, PIN details and other links had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been gathered and recorded, the inference from all of which being that it could be alleged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there was wholesale and industrial interception of mobile telephone messages, would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all have remained unrevealed. Even if the Guardian or the New York Times had managed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obtain sufficient information to enable the police to rely, without more, on the factual basis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the stories as published, the extent of what was going on would have remained hidden.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The history of these particular investigations have been analysed at length but it would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">truly remarkable if, because in each case of one specific complaint, the police had managed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to identify the only private detectives indulging in this type of intrusion.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The same is so, but even more so, in relation to the bribery of public officials. Putting the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question of public interest to one side for a moment, there will be no complaint to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police about such conduct because it will be undetectable unless the public official is foolish</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enough to make some admission or leave some incriminating evidence around for someone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">else to see. The journalist will not reveal his or her source for a story (on which see below)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, irrespective of the likely public interest in the story (or, just as likely, the absence of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any discernible public interest), it will be almost impossible to get to the bottom of it. Leak</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inquiries almost inevitably fail to achieve their purpose.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Considerable emphasis was placed on the fact that the Information Commissioner has always</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made it clear that, since the reports<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy</span> and<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Now</span> , he has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not received complaints in relation to journalism; in relation to bribery, the present work of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the MPS under the umbrella of Operation Elveden is also identified as demonstrating that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this type of behaviour is also subject of rigorous police investigation. Neither of these facts,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">however, supports the wider propositions which are advanced.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">What is not acknowledged is the fact that absent evidence to point to the commission of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an offence (which requires rather more than mere assertion before any report, let alone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation, can be considered justifiable), nobody who has been the subject of intrusion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will necessarily be aware of the circumstances in which information about them came to enter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the public domain. At its highest will be a concern that someone has provided information to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a journalist which has then been published but any attempt to identify from whom or how</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that material was obtained will fail on the basis that no journalist will reveal a source.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Elveden has led to a large number of arrests of journalists and, in addition, public officials,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the inference being that this is simply a consequence of the police doing the work that they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">always could have done had they properly investigated the documentation that they had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in their possession. That is not, however, the way in which Deputy Assistant Commissioner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Akers put the matter. She said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Management and Standards Committee (MSC) is an independent body outside</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of NI and was formally established by News Corp on 21 July [2011]. ... In this role they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">respond to requests for information from the police which we consider are relevant</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to our inquiries. Our aim is to identify criminality. It is not to uncover legitimate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sources and therefore the MSC responds in a manner that seeks to protect legitimate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalist sources at all times. They are also overseeing the searches being conducted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the 300 million emails produced by NI.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">... The MSC&#8217;s role and remit is important to Operation Elveden as current legislation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would make it difficult, if not impossible, for police to access material of the type</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it is seeking without that assistance. Where there is an evidential base to request</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information, the MSC have provided it in an unredacted format in order to enable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">police to identify the public official concerned. However, in relation to wider requests</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regarding the system by which alleged cash/cheque payments were made, the MSC</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">provide information to police in a redacted form, i.e. with the names of the potential</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">source redacted, until police are able to produce evidence that can justify identifying</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">the source.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not, perhaps, surprising that there has been considerable criticism of News International</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(NI) for providing such help to the police and, to put the matter colloquially, for &#8220;shopping&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or &#8220;grassing&#8221; on their own employees. The contrary view is that the company has been very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerned to demonstrate that whatever has happened at the NoTW (or other titles under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their control) has not only been without the authority of the most senior management of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">company but also is entirely contrary to the principles on which the company operates. As a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">result, the company has done all that it can to assist the police where prima facie evidence of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal behaviour has been identified. The words &#8216;prima facie&#8217; are very important because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NI has not conceded that criminal offences have been committed but only that police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation is justifiable.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-14"><a href="#para2-14" name="para2-14">2.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thus, the mere fact that there are lengthy investigations of phone hacking (Operation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Weeting) and the bribery of public officials and others (Operation Elveden) is not evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it was and always has been open to the police to conduct the type of investigation now</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">underway. Without the active cooperation of NI, it is clear that the extensive investigations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would not have been possible: evidence of the earlier (different) approach is clear from what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">happened when the police sought to investigate in 2005 during Operation Caryatid which is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">outlined above.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It must be emphasised that these points are not made to imply that there has been any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breach by a journalist of the data protection legislation in the period since 2006 or, indeed,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the payment of public officials for stories provided in breach of their duty is necessarily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more extensive than has been revealed or is suspected as a result of recent disclosures.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Equally, however, the absence of complaint is little better than neutral and does not mean</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that steps should not be taken by newspaper organisations to put into place a regime that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provides positive reassurance that the law is not being breached (save only in relation to data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protection offences where the public interest justifies it). I am perfectly prepared to accept</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the evidence, for example, from Associated Newspapers Ltd, that as a result of a specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">instruction from the editor-in-chief, no private detective has been engaged by the company</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">since the publication of<span style="font-style:italic"> What</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Price</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Privacy</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Now,</span> but this assertion to the Inquiry cannot take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the place of a regular and verifiable audit.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-16"><a href="#para2-16" name="para2-16">2.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Putting complaint by a victim to the police to one side, the second approach to the detection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of crime is similarly of little value in cases such as might arise in relation to the press. The fact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is that it is almost inconceivable that the gathering of intelligence in a covert manner would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be considered as either necessary or, in any event, appropriate. Not only is it unlikely that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminality which could be revealed would be of sufficient gravity to justify such steps but, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">addition, it is not clear how such information gathering could be undertaken.</span>

<h2>3. The investigation of crime: gathering evidence</h2>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Assuming that a complaint has been made to the police, the problems facing any investigator</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have only just begun not least because of the respect which the law accords to journalists,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the fundamental rights of freedom of expression and a free press and the entirely legitimate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibilityofthepresstoholdpowertoaccount.Suchisthesignificanceoftheseimportant</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">A detailed analysis of the powers and duties in respect of the search and seizure when that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impacts on the work of journalists is set out in Appendix 4. It is sufficient to emphasise that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material acquired or created for the purpose of journalism, held on a confidential basis by a</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref13" name="footnote13" title="Go back to footnote reference 13 in the text">13</a>.  Part E, Chapter 4</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1485"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">person who acquired or created it for that purpose, constitutes excluded material pursuant to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ss11(1) and 13 of PACE and other journalistic material constitutes special procedure material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(see s14 of the Act). Search for such material is covered by the more restrictive provisions set</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out in Schedule 1 of the Act, which require the judge called upon to consider an application</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for production or a warrant to have regard the public interest; this is wide enough to include</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the importance of the impartiality and independence of the press, the potential stifling of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public debate or other relevant factors.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These protections are not, of course, designed to protect journalists from the consequences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of their own deliberate criminality unconnected with the public interest, but the law certainly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explains why DAC Akers expressed herself in the way in which she did in her evidence. One</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the results of the legislation is that, in protecting what it is entirely appropriate to protect,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there is a risk that behaviour which deserves no protection will not be uncovered. It makes it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that much more difficult to obtain evidence to support (or, indeed, to undermine) a complaint,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">making much more remote the prospect of prosecution even where the true facts, if they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were known, would demonstrate that such a prosecution was entirely merited.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These difficulties both in relation to complaint and investigation only serve again to put the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">burdenonjournaliststorespectthe reasonsfortheirfreedomsandnottoabusethatprotection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by invoking it to cover up that which cannot be justified. They also utterly undermine the case</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that all allegations of criminality can be left to the police to be investigated in exactly the same</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">way that other allegations of crime are investigated. Thus, if there are these protections in law</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which, I accept, are entirely and fully justifiable, there must be some other way in which the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press itself and the journalists who work within it can be held to account in relation to their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">own conduct.</span>

<a name="section4"></a>
<h2>4. A failure of policing</h2>

<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Against this background it is necessary to consider the wider point that this Inquiry should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examine the failure of the police to investigate phone hacking, rather than the activities of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press. The argument is that the Mulcaire notes were available to the police for them fully</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to investigate yet, for years, they did nothing. The detailed discussion of Operation Caryatid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appears above<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup> but this question must be considered not just in the context of that case</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but as a systemic issue concerned with the balance between what conduct should fall only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to those responsible for law enforcement and what conduct should be of concern of any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">business (and its employees) as to the way in which it goes about what it does. This has to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered both at an individual but also a corporate level.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A number of witnesses were asked whether, at an individual level, the suggestion that all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that had transpired was a failure of policing might seem like blaming the police for their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">failure to stop motorists speeding, rather than the motorist for speeding in the first place. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is certainly unarguable that there are no small number of offences that are committed when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is believed by their perpetrators that they will not be detected and, in the most part, they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are not detected. Perhaps not surprisingly, cars slow down when approaching speed cameras</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">and speed up after the risk of being caught is passed. Few can drive or walk on the streets</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">without seeing drivers use mobile telephones notwithstanding the prohibition on doing so.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">These are, however, individual offences committed by individuals: there is no mechanism to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">encourage or exhort those individuals to obey the law, other than the risk that an offence will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be detected and the offender pursued.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">That is not to say that procedures cannot be put into place that allow the extent to which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals are complying with the law to be monitored. Pursuing the motoring analogy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(without in any sense suggesting that there is an equivalence between motoring offences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the type of offending with which the Inquiry has been concerned or, indeed, between the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privilege of being able to drive and the right to free expression), such measures are required in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">connection with the use of certain types of heavy goods vehicles. In one sense, the driver of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">heavy goods vehicle is individually responsible for observing the speed limits, rest regulations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and other obligations placed upon him for reasons of general road safety. Breaching those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regulations constitutes an offence but it would obviously seldom realistically be possible for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the authorities to follow a driver to ensure compliance. By requiring every such vehicle to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be fitted with a tachograph, however, compliance can be monitored and a check made to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discover whether the driver is, in fact, complying with his legal obligations.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is possible to pursue this analogy a little further by considering the corporate level. Although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">employers may have difficulty monitoring the way in which their employees drive company</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cars not required to have a tachograph, the requirement on employers to ensure that heavy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">goods vehicles are fitted with a tachograph and that the appropriate records for each vehicle</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are maintained allows a system of audit for the employer to check on drivers and for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">authorities to check on employers. A rogue driver, regularly breaching the regulations, should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be discovered; if he is not and, even more so, if there are many such rogue drivers within one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisation, conclusions as to the cultural approach to road safety within that organisation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">can legitimately be drawn. Moving away from road traffic, it is commonplace for organisations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with regulatory obligations to put into place compliance mechanisms intended to promote</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(if not ensure) proper practice.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup> Equally, compliance is encouraged by an organisation if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its culture, or the law, requires self-reporting to the regulator in the event that a breach is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discovered.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup> This approach does no more than reflect that the police (or a regulator) cannot</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be everywhere all the time and will not be well placed to detect impropriety which is likely to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remain hidden, particularly when there is no complainant and, thus, no complaint.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For the press, of course, there is no such regulatory regime and there is no suggestion that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there should be. But the problem remains: what can be done to ensure that the law (and,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perhaps, an ethical code) is treated with respect by all and that a culture is maintained to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effect that short cuts to obtaining a good story must not involve conduct which responsible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists would consider reprehensible? If any journalist truly believes that almost anything</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">goes in pursuit of a story, and that the basis for that story will be protected by the newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerned as a journalistic source which will never be revealed, and, furthermore, this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach works, it is not surprising if a culture to that effect develops and the police will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">simply never be involved. This culture can, however, be avoided if the editor and newspaper</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whether or not there was a failure in policing does not impact on the culture, practices and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ethics of the press, save only to the extent that anyone might have thought that the absence</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the legality of what was being done than should have been. To put the same point another</span>

<h2>5. Police resources</h2>

<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is a further problem in seeking to cast responsibility for the overall present state of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">affairs on the police on the basis that there has simply been a failure of law enforcement. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach, so far, has proceeded on the basis that police manpower resources are limitless and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that if there is a complaint which is sufficiently based in provable fact to justify investigation,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that investigation will be undertaken. The safeguards in the Police and Criminal Evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Act (PACE) 1984 designed to protect journalistic material will be respected and the matter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pursued, whether or not that will permit sufficient evidence to be disclosed to convert a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaint into a case which can be put before a prosecutor with sufficient prospect of success</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to justify commencement of a prosecution. In fact, superimposed on the limitations based</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">upon the unlikelihood of there being a complaint, and the potential legal and other problems</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that an investigation will have to address, is the fact that police investigative resources are by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no means limitless and work has to be prioritised in relation to every aspect of policing. It is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">therefore inevitable that a decision will have to be taken at an early stage whether the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest sufficiently requires resources for this type of investigation, perhaps at the expense</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of investigating other criminal activity or undertaking other types of police work.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-2"><a href="#para5-2" name="para5-2">5.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In that regard, it is not sufficient to point to the activities of the MPS since January 2011,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when for understandable reasons concerned with their reputation and, in addition, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Crown Prosecution Service, very considerable resources have been devoted to all the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence initially available from the search of the home of Mulcaire and now supplemented</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by material from the Management and Standards Committee at News International. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstances of these investigations and the prior history is analysed at length<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup> but these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are exceptional. The truth is that in relation to individual specific complaints, the complexity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of any investigation, the likely attitude of the relevant newspaper to the provision of evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the difficulty of securing sufficient evidence potentially to satisfy the very high burden</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cast upon prosecutors will almost inevitably mean that a conclusion will be reached that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resources are better devoted to other, and arguably more serious, complaints of crime.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">More than a few witnesses made it clear that the police were simply not interested in pursuing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints when made. By way of example, Sheryl Gascoigne<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup> and Sienna Miller<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup> explained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Inquiry that complaints about being pursued by the press were not investigated or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken further. In one sense, Mr Gove was absolutely right; the police should be appropriately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resourced to investigate crime; unfortunately, until resourced to investigate every complaint</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">while, at the same time, carrying on the very many other duties cast upon the police,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">priorities will be inevitable. The fact that certain crimes (if crimes they ultimately turn out to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be) will be considered a low priority, perhaps because of the inherent risks and complexity in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undertaking an investigation into them, (or the very limited prospects that an investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will be successful) does not, or should not, impact on the propriety or justifiability of them</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being committed.</span>

<h2>6. Public interest: a defence to crime</h2>

<p id="para-id-6-1"><a href="#para6-1" name="para6-1">6.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The analysis of the criminal law reveals that the only offence in respect of which there is a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specific defence in law is that contained within s55 of the DPA (namely whether, objectively,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the obtaining, disclosing or procuring of personal data was justified as being in the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest which concept is undefined). As part of the legislative proposal contained within</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">s77-78 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, not yet in force, an increase in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">maximum penalty for breach of s55 of the DPA sits alongside a new defence which covers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the position where a person acts for special purposes (including journalism) with a view</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the publication of journalistic material in the reasonable belief (subjectively held by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalist) that the obtaining, disclosing or procuring of the data with a view to publication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was in the public interest.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-2"><a href="#para6-2" name="para6-2">6.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It has been suggested that, far from extending the way in which the criminal law operates to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protect victims of journalistic practices that all who have appeared before the Inquiry have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">condemned, the reach of the criminal law should be reduced by importing a defence to all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">crime that was committed by a journalist acting in the public interest.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup> The example most</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">often given is the story published initially by the Daily Telegraph, which exposed the way in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which the expenses system for Members of Parliament had been abused and, in particular,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the fact that the Daily Telegraph paid a large sum of money to someone for a disc of all MPs&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expenses which, it is said, must have been provided, at the very least, in breach of confidence.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence of the then editor, Will Lewis, was that advice was sought at every stage and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very great care was taken to ensure that what the Daily Telegraph did was not in breach of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal law<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup> but I recognise that, were that situation to recur today, questions about breach</span>

<a name="page1489"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Bribery Act 2010 could be more difficult to resolve. A more recent example related to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the bribery of a court official to remove driving offences from the court record which was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exposed in The Sun.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-3"><a href="#para6-3" name="para6-3">6.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The argument is that no journalist should be put in peril of being guilty of crime when he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or she is pursuing a story, the publication of which will be in the public interest. The vital</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significance of the role of the press in holding power to account (and by publishing stories</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that uncover misconduct about which the public is entitled to know) can only be encouraged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by complete protection from the risk of criminal prosecution; there is otherwise insufficient</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protection for such a journalist who should not have to weigh up the personal risk of criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecution when deciding whether or not to proceed. The importance of the principle is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">furtherunderlinedbythefactthatjournalistshavebeenpreparedtotakethatrisk(particularly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to the unwillingness to disclose sources) and that their position has been reflected</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and recognised (albeit couched with an appropriate exception) by Article 10 of the ECHR in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terms that:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;No court may require a person to disclose nor is any person guilty of contempt of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">court for refusing to disclose the source of information contained in a publication</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for which he is responsible unless it be established to the satisfaction of the court</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that disclosure is necessary in the interests of justice, or national security or for the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">prevention of disorder or crime.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-4"><a href="#para6-4" name="para6-4">6.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This suggestion is far from being a simple extension of the present or proposed defence to a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contravention of s55 of the DPA. Given the different ways (representing different points in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">chronology) in which such an offence can be committed, to be effective, the test would have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be satisfied at each stage. Thus, using the present law, it might be possible to procure or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obtain personal data on the basis that there is an objectively justifiable basis for concluding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that to do so is in the public interest. Disclosing that personal data raises potentially different</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issues. Take as an example the possibility that a journalist has information that there is a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">link between a public official (whose private life is of no public interest) and an exposed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">corrupt agent and that the latter is improperly influencing the former in the performance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his duties. The journalist deceptively obtains details of the telephone records of the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">official, discovers that there is no such link but that it is obvious that the public official is having</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an extra-marital affair. There may be a public interest defence in procuring or obtaining the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">data in the first place but there is hardly any public interest in then disclosing what has, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fact, been discovered (as opposed to what it was thought, in fact wrongly, might have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discovered).</span>

<p id="para-id-6-5"><a href="#para6-5" name="para6-5">6.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Other criminal offences, however, are not based around the protection of data but rather bite</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the moment of commission. Assume the same example as above but that the only way to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obtain the evidence of a connection was by bribing (or blackmailing) an employee to provide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the information, and that doing so produced not the evidence of a corrupt relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but evidence of the extra-marital affair. With that evidence obtained, subject to potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arguments of privacy in the civil law (which an editor may well be prepared to argue), there</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be nothing to prevent the journalist from publishing the story of the affair.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-6"><a href="#para6-6" name="para6-6">6.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the face of it, many journalists might argue that this is entirely justifiable. A story (albeit not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the story sought) has been lawfully obtained and there is no reason based upon its manner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of acquisition why it should not be put into the public domain. What it depends on, however,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is the information of a link between the official and the corrupt agent. Assuming that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">story emerged, how could the proposed defence to an allegation of bribery or blackmail</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref25" name="footnote25" title="Go back to footnote reference 25 in the text">25</a>.  Details contained in the judgment of the Court of Appeal [2012] EWCA Crim 1243</p><!--footnote-->
<a name="page1490"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">ever be tested? The journalist will say (whether honestly or not) that the information came</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from a reliable source, responsible in the past for much entirely accurate material, whom he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is not prepared to name under any circumstances. The effect of a defence in law will be to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">emasculate almost all prospect of bringing a journalist to task for the way in which a story has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been researched, whatever means, at first blush illegal, might have been used.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-7"><a href="#para6-7" name="para6-7">6.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Neither is a criminal defence necessary. It might be thought that it is only right that both editors</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and journalists should think long and hard before embarking on what is criminal conduct in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an effort to pursue a story and that it should not be sufficient to rely on an undisclosed source</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or sources as an all embracing defence. There are, however, other mechanisms to ensure that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the law is not brought to bear on journalists (or, indeed, on any one else) in an oppressive or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unfair way.</span>

<a name="section7"></a>
<h2>7. Public interest: the decision to prosecute</h2>

<p id="para-id-7-1"><a href="#para7-1" name="para7-1">7.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are a number of mechanisms in place to prevent or inhibit the prosecution of crime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which might be described (in non-technical language) as abusive. These revolve around the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision of the prosecutor to prosecute; the control that any criminal court exercises over</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">abuse of its process; the &#8216;rights&#8217; of the jury; and the ultimate discretion of a sentencing judge.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is worth discussing each of these in turn.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-2"><a href="#para7-2" name="para7-2">7.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whatever might have been the position previously, in recent times the decision of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecutor to prosecute has always involved the exercise of discretion. On 29 January 1951,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the then Attorney General, Sir Hartley Shawcross QC, made a statement to the House of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commons which has been frequently since repeated and adopted by subsequent Attorneys</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">General. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It has never been the rule in this country &#8211; I hope it never will be &#8211; that suspected</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">criminal offences must automatically be the subject of prosecution.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-3"><a href="#para7-3" name="para7-3">7.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Until this Inquiry, the manifestation of this discretion was only contained within the Code for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Crown Prosecutors, which not only prescribes an evidential test (whether there is sufficient</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against each suspect on each charge)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but also a public interest test which is articulated in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A prosecution will usually take place unless the prosecutor is surethat therearepublic</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interest factors tending against prosecution which outweigh those tending in favour,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or unless the prosecutor is satisfied that the public interest may be properly served,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the first instance, by offering the offender the opportunity to have the matter dealt</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with by an out-of-court disposal (see section 7). The more serious the offence or the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">offender&#8217;s record of criminal behaviour, the more likely it is that a prosecution will be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">required in the public interest.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Assessing the public interest is not simply a matter of adding up the number of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">factors on each side and seeing which side has the greater number. Each case must</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be considered on its own facts and on its own merits. Prosecutors must decide the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">importance of each public interest factor in the circumstances of each case and go</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on to make an overall assessment. It is quite possible that one factor alone may</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">outweigh a number of other factors which tend in the opposite direction. Although</span>

<p id="para-id-7-4"><a href="#para7-4" name="para7-4">7.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Not least because of the expressed concern relating to journalists, the Inquiry raised the issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC (DPP) and, seeking an analysis of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the position, also invited him to consider whether it was appropriate to enunciate a policy in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to the public interest in the prosecution of journalists.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup> His statement recognised the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considerable public concern about the allegedly criminal activities of some journalists and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">saw no difficulty in developing a bespoke policy to give guidance to staff as to the approach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to such difficult cases. Thereafter, on 18 April 2012, he published interim guidelines (on which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he commenced a consultation exercise) on assessing the public interest in cases affecting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the media. He distinguished between the public interest served by freedom of expression</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the right to receive and impart information and the separate question of whether a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecution is in the public interest (being the second stage of the Code test).</span>

<p id="para-id-7-5"><a href="#para7-5" name="para7-5">7.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That process of consultation concluded and, on 13 September 2012, the DPP issued formal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Guidelines.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup> Having reviewed the general principles relating to prosecution, the Guidelines</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">refer to principles of special application in cases affecting the media by reference to Article</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">10 of the ECHR and decisions such as<span style="font-style:italic"> Sunday</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Times</span><span style="font-style:italic"> v</span><span style="font-style:italic"> UK</span><span style="font-style:italic"> (No</span><span style="font-style:italic"> 2)</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup> in addition to the further</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">then identify that the appropriate approach is encapsulated by the question whether the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public interest served by the conduct in question outweighs the overall criminality.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-6"><a href="#para7-6" name="para7-6">7.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is then an outline of the way in which prosecutors should deal with the question by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">following a three stage process: that is to say (1) assessing the public interest served by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the conduct in question; (2) assessing the overall criminality; and (3) weighing these two</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considerations. In relation to the public interest served by freedom of expression and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">right to receive and impart information (not previously defined in law), examples of conduct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">capable of serving the public interest are provided which are not intended to be exhaustive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but which include the following:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;(a) Conduct which is capable of disclosing that a criminal offence has been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">committed, is being committed, or is likely to be committed.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) Conduct which is capable of disclosing that a person has failed, is failing, or is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">likely to fail to comply with any legal obligation to which s/he is subject.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) Conduct which is capable of disclosing that a miscarriage of justice has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">occurred, is occurring or is likely to occur.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(d) Conduct which is capable of raising or contributing to an important matter of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public debate (of which there is no exhaustive definition but examples include</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public debate about serious impropriety, significant unethical conduct and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">significant incompetence which affects the public).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(e) Conduct which is capable of disclosing that anything falling within any one of</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the above is being, or is likely to be, deliberately concealed.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">As to the assessment of overall criminality, the Guidelines require prosecutors to focus on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the conduct in question, the extent of the wrong-doing and the harm caused. They gave as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">non-exhaustive examples:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;(a) The impact on the victim(s) of the conduct in question, including the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consequences for the victim(s).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(b) Whether the victim was under 18 or in a vulnerable position.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(c) The overall loss and damage caused by the conduct in question</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(d) Whether the conduct was part of a repeated or routine pattern of behaviour</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of likely to continue.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(e) Whether there was any element of corruption in the conduct in question.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(f) Whether the conduct in question included the use of threats, harassment or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">intimidation.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(g) The impact on any course of justice, for example whether a criminal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation or proceedings may have been put in jeopardy.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(h) The motivation of the suspect insofar as it can be ascertained (examples might</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">range from malice or financial gain at one extreme to a belief that the conduct</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would be in the public interest at the other taking into account the information</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">available to the suspect at the time).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(i) Whether the public interest in question could equally well have been served</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by some lawful means having regard to all the circumstances in the particular</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">case.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-8"><a href="#para7-8" name="para7-8">7.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Guidelines go on to make the point that the impact on the victim(s) of the conduct in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question is of considerable importance<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup> and the fact that invasions of privacy can be keenly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">felt and can cause considerable distress to victims (although &#8220;regard must be given to the level</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the seriousness of the invasion, whether on the facts there was a reasonable expectation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of privacy and whether the conduct in question was proportionate to the public interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">claimed to be served&#8221;). As for the decision, the Guidelines go on to make two further, very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">important, points. These are:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;37. Prosecutors are reminded that assessing whether a prosecution is required in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the public interest is not an arithmetical exercise involving the addition of the number</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of factors on each side and then making a decision according to which side has the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">greater number. Rather, each case must be considered on its own facts and its own</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">merits. It is quite possible that one factor alone may outweigh a number of other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">factors which tend in the opposite direction. Even where there may be a number</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of public interest factors which tend against prosecution in a particular case, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">prosecutor should consider whether the case should go ahead but with those factors</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">being drawn to the court&#8217;s attention so that they can be duly considered by the court.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">38. Prosecutors should take special care in cases which involve the disclosure of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalists&#8217; sources. In approaching such cases, prosecutors are reminded that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">European Court of Human Rights has indicated that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions of press freedom</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8230; Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in informing the public on matters of public interest. As a result the vital public</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regard to the importance of the protection of journalistic sources for press</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">freedom in a democratic society and the potentially chilling effect of an order of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">source disclosure has on the exercise of that freedom, such a measure cannot be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">compatible with Article 10 of the Convention unless it is justified by an overriding</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">requirement in the public interest.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-9"><a href="#para7-9" name="para7-9">7.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When the DPP was giving evidence, it was made clear that it was not for me or for the Inquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to enunciate a prosecutions policy and, further, that it was a matter for him to determine</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether or not he wished to.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup> However, it is clearly important that he has chosen to accept</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the invitation proffered to him and now gone so far, after consultation, as to issue formal and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thus definitive Guidelines.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">obviously have excluded any prosecution should one have been considered in relation to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disclosure of MPs&#8217; expenses). It is beyond doubt that journalists would prefer guarantees</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and immunity but, put simply, that would be unjustified and would do nothing to ensure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that appropriate standards of behaviour were set, encouraged, supported and enforced, not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">merely as a matter of criminal law but also editorial practice.</span>

<h2>8.  Public interest: other safeguards in the criminal  process</h2>


<p id="para-id-8-1"><a href="#para8-1" name="para8-1">8.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Threeotherprotectivemechanismsareavailableforjournalists,eachofwhichcanbedescribed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">shortly. First, although the court has no jurisdiction to interfere with the exercise by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecution of its discretion to prosecute,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup> it can offer advice to the prosecutor and require</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">instructions to be taken from the prosecuting authority before permitting the prosecution to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commence. Furthermore, the court can stay a prosecution as an abuse of the process of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">court, either because it represents an abuse of executive power<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup> or in circumstances which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">amounted to an &#8216;affront to the public conscience&#8217;;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref38" href="#footnote38">38</a></sup> &#8216;so great an affront to the integrity of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the justice system and therefore the rule of law that the associated prosecution was thereby</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rendered abusive and ought not to be countenanced by the court&#8217; is also sufficient.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref39" href="#footnote39">39</a></sup> It is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not necessary to seek to define how these principles might be applied to the prosecution of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a journalist; given the proposed guidelines on prosecution, it is extremely unlikely they will</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ever arise, but there should be little doubt that the circumstances will be obvious if they did.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-2"><a href="#para8-2" name="para8-2">8.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second protective mechanism must be mentioned as a matter of constitutional reality.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There are examples, littered throughout history, in which juries are properly directed as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the law and, in particular, the ingredients of a specific offence, who then take the view</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, irrespective of the law, they are not prepared to convict for what they perceive to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">good reasons. The best (and oft-cited) example is the acquittal of Clive Ponting, a senior civil</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">servant, of offences contrary to s2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911, following his disclosure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Tam Dalyell MP of documents relating to the sinking of the General Belgrano during the</span>

<a name="page1494"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">Falklands War in 1982. No reliance could be placed on the prospect of a jury taking this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">course in relation to a journalist but no analysis of the position would be accurate without it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being mentioned.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-3"><a href="#para8-3" name="para8-3">8.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The third protective mechanism is, in one sense, the ultimate safeguard. Although (in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">absence of abuse of process) the court cannot prevent a prosecution from being pursued and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will conduct the trial entirely in accordance with the law, should a journalist be convicted, a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very substantial discretion vests in the judge when it comes to sentence.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup> Even in those cases</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">governed by guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council (which every court &#8216;must follow&#8217;),</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the ultimate discretion is preserved by the words &#8216;unless the court is satisfied that it would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contrary to the interests of justice to do so&#8217;: see s125(1) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-4"><a href="#para8-4" name="para8-4">8.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thus, if a prosecution has been pursued which the judge concludes did not correctly balance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the extent to which the public interest served by the conduct in question outweighed the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">overall criminality, it is open to him or her to reflect that fact in the sentence passed. At one</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">end of the spectrum is an order of absolute discharge, prescribed by s12(1) of the Powers of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 in these terms:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Where a court is of the opinion, having regard to the circumstances including the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nature of the offence and the character of the offender, that it is inexpedient to inflict</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">punishment, the court may make an order discharging him absolutely.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-5"><a href="#para8-5" name="para8-5">8.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The effect of such an order is that the conviction is &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> deemed</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> conviction</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span><span style="font-style:italic"> any</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">Act.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-6"><a href="#para8-6" name="para8-6">8.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The argument that has been advanced is that, by this stage, the journalist has had to undergo</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the indignity of prosecution and trial and that the decision of the judge that it is inexpedient to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inflict punishment, doubtless because of the view that the judge takes of the prosecution, is of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">little comfort. This is a form of special pleading. The fact is that the journalist will have chosen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deliberately to break the law in pursuit of a story. That should not be an everyday occurrence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and it should be common place that no such decision is taken without the authority of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper which employs him or her and then only following a careful consideration of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material that justifies it. If the journalist is freelance, it will be extremely wise for any such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision to be documented and the evidence base for it made clear.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-7"><a href="#para8-7" name="para8-7">8.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In those circumstances, the decision of an independent prosecutor should not be feared or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered an unnecessary interference with the freedom of the press: it is a check on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exercise of that freedom which ensures that it is not being abused. There are then potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">checks on the prosecutor&#8217;s decision, ultimately, by the court should a prosecution ensue and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reach the stage of sentence. Provided appropriate attention is paid to the importance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a free press and the duty of the press to hold power to account, there is no reason why</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists should not be subject to exactly the same checks and balances that every other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">member of society has to endure should they seek to exercise some right or privilege.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the maximum penalty for an offence under s55 of the Data Protection Act 1988 (which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requires an order from the Secretary of State implementing the provisions of s77-78 of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008),<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup> I do not recommend that any change is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary to the substantive criminal law.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">On the basis that the provisions of s77-78 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">Act 2008 are brought into effect, so that increased sentencing powers are available </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">for breaches of s55 of the Data Protection Act 1998, I also recommend that the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">Secretary of State for Justice use the power vested in him by s124(1)(a)(i) of the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">Coroners  and  Justice  Act  2009  to  invite  the  Sentencing  Council  of  England  and </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">Wales  to  prepare  guidelines  in  relation  to  data  protection  offences  (including </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">computer misuse). With the new statutory maximum and the lack of precedent, </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">it is important that courts recognise the gravity of this type of offending and are </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">also provided with guidance regarding the implications should circumstances arise </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">when it becomes necessary to consider the commission of this type of offence by </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">a journalist.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-2"><a href="#para9-2" name="para9-2">9.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The value of involving the Sentencing Council is obvious. Before producing a guideline, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Council is required to consult on a draft and include within that consultation process &#8220;such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other persons as the Council considers appropriate&#8221;:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup> only then is a guideline promulgated. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is inconceivable that the Council would not consider it appropriate to consult the Information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner, the media and any other interested parties on the appropriate categories of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the offence, the range of sentence for each category and both the aggravating and mitigating</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstances.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-3"><a href="#para9-3" name="para9-3">9.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Turning to the procedural criminal law, in submissions concerned with recommendations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for a new more effective policy and the future conduct of relations between the police and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press, the Deputy Commissioner, Craig Mackey, has identified three issues of particular</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significance. Each of these is concerned with the operation of the PACE. The first concerns</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what he describes as the &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic"> camouflage</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> apparent</span><span style="font-style:italic"> co-operation,</span> &#8217; which itself can defeat an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">application foraproduction orderbecauseof therequirementin theaccessconditions, setout</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in para 2(b) of Schedule 1 to PACE, that &#8216;other methods&#8217; of obtaining the material have failed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or have not been tried because it appeared that they were bound to fail. The second relates</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the extreme difficulty of obtaining journalistic material by means of a production order.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The third concerns the absence of a statutory exclusion from journalistic material of items</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">held with the intention of furthering a criminal purpose: that situation is to be contrasted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the fact that &#8216;criminal purpose&#8217; material is excluded from legal professional privilege by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">s10(2) of PACE. I shall deal with them in turn.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-4"><a href="#para9-4" name="para9-4">9.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As to the first proposition, DC Mackey points to the evidence of non-cooperation that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">surrounded the attempt to search the NoTW building and what he described as &#8216;the veneer</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of apparent co-operation&#8217; which followed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup> On that basis, it is argued that the police would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not be able to satisfy the access conditions contained in para 2(b) because the company and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its solicitors would always be able to point to assertions of willingness to assist, whatever was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">happening in fact. He submits that para 2(b) should simply be repealed.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref41" name="footnote41" title="Go back to footnote reference 41 in the text">41</a>.  This recommendation is dealt with at length in Part H, Chapter 5</p><!--footnote-->

<a name="page1496"></a><!--new page--><p id="para-id-9-5"><a href="#para9-5" name="para9-5">9.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This proposition contains within it a far reaching challenge to the checks and balances that are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">built into PACE and, for my part, I am not convinced that it would be appropriate to infer from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this particular investigation a wider problem concerning obtaining material in circumstances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such as obtained here: even if that is the case, it is not evidenced.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-6"><a href="#para9-6" name="para9-6">9.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second concern relates to the definition of journalistic material. The phrase is defined</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by s13(2) PACE as &#8216;in the possession of a person who acquired or created it for the purposes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of journalism&#8217;. That phrase &#8211; the purposes of journalism &#8211; is not defined in the Act but has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been given a narrow meaning in the context of the Freedom of Information Act 2000.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup> I see</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no reason why there should be a different construction of the phrase in the context of PACE.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-7"><a href="#para9-7" name="para9-7">9.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The third concern relates to the question whether journalistic material continues to fall</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within the scope of excluded material (so as to fall within the scope of the second set of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">access conditions in Schedule 1 of PACE) if it has been created or acquired in furtherance of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a crime. Mr Mackey poses the question: if there was iniquity such as crime or fraud did the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">duty of confidence ever arise? If not, then the journalistic material will not be held under an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undertaking, restriction or obligation of confidence as required by s11(3) of PACE.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-8"><a href="#para9-8" name="para9-8">9.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Mackey&#8217;s submission is advanced in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The concept of confidentiality is subject to limiting principles, one of which is that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the public interest in protecting confidences may be outweighed by some other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">countervailing public interest which favours disclosure, such as that a person cannot</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be the confidant of a crime or fraud (see Lord Goff in AG v. Guardian Newspapers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(No. 2) [1990] 1 AC 109 at 282-3). However, the case law concerning the &#8217;defence of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">iniquity&#8217; deals with whether a contractual duty of confidence can be enforced (see</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">e.g. Gartside v. Outram (1857) 26 LJ Ch (NS) 113, Initial Services v. Putterill [1968] QB</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">396, at 410). There is no direct authority on whether confidentiality under the PACE</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">statutory decision still applies, where it is in the context of criminal behaviour.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">A caveat was expressly introduced into s10(2) of PACE, dealing with legal professional</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">privilege [to the effect that Items held with the intention of furthering a criminal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">purpose are not items subject to legal privilege]. However, no such caveat was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">introduced into sll of PACE dealing with journalistic material held in confidence.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-9"><a href="#para9-9" name="para9-9">9.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The point is then made that similar provisions to Schedule 1 PACE are contained in Schedule 5</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Terrorism Act 2005, which uses the same definitions of &#8216;items subject to legal privilege&#8217;,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;excluded material&#8217; and &#8216;special procedure material&#8217; as in PACE. A simpler set of access</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conditions provides grounds on which an application for a production order could be granted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under that Act even in relation to journalistic material (although one of the conditions is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it is in the public interest having regard to the benefit likely to accrue to a terrorist</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation if the material is obtained).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup> The submission goes on (at para 3.6):</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref44" name="footnote44" title="Go back to footnote reference 44 in the text">44</a>. <em> Sugar v British Broadcasting Corporation</em> [2012] UKSC 4 per Lord Phillips (at para 67) &#8220;Information should only befound to be held for the purposes of journalism ... if an immediate object of holding the information is to use it forone of those purposes&#8221;; Lord Walker (at para. 84) &#8220;The question whether information is held for the purposes of journalism should thus be considered in a relatively narrow rather than a relatively wide way&#8221;; Lord Brown (at par 106) that &#8220;the central question to be asked ... will be ... whether there remains any sufficiently direct link between the BBC&#8217;s continuing holding of the information and the achievement of its journalistic purposes&#8221;.

<a name="page1497"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Parliament has therefore expressly allowed applications to be made for excluded</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">material (including journalistic material obtained in confidence) in terrorism cases,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and added a &#8217;public interest&#8217; condition (similar to paragraph 2(c) of Sch.1 to PACE)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">under which the court can take into account, amongst other factors, whether the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalist or media corporation was involved in any criminal activity. Yet Parliament</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">did not include any such provisions in PACE. It is arguable, therefore, that Parliament</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">did not intend the courts to override the PACE definition of journalistic material held</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in confidence simply by saying it is not held in confidence where it is not in the public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">interest.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-10"><a href="#para9-10" name="para9-10">9.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is certainly remarkable that Parliament might have provided greater protection for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalistic material than in relation to legal professional privilege as a matter of general</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">law. Even more so that it would provide less protection for the material where the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest is served in relation to a terrorist investigation than might be the case if that material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been created or acquired in furtherance of crime. Although the circumstances in which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the provision might bite will hopefully be very rare, I see force in the submission that s11(3)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PACE should be amended by providing that journalistic material is only held in confidence for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PACE provisions if it is held, or has continuously been held since it was first acquired or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">created, subject to an enforceable or lawful undertaking, restriction or obligation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-9-11"><a href="#para9-11" name="para9-11">9.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am very conscious that I have received submissions only from the MPS on this topic and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there is potential room for argument that any amendment to PACE will have far wider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ramifications of which I have not been apprised and go beyond the limited goals that DC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mackey seeks to achieve. Before any conclusion can be reached on any of these issues,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate consultation will be essential.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">In the circumstances, without pre-judging any conclusion, I recommend that the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">Home Office should consider and, if necessary, consult upon (a) whether paragraph </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">2(b) of Schedule 1 to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 should be repealed; </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">(b) whether PACE should be amended to provide a definition of the phrase &#8220;for </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">the purposes of journalism&#8221; in s13(2); and (c) whether s11(3) of PACE should be </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">amended by providing that journalistic material is only held in confidence for the </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">PACE provisions if it is held or has continuously been held since it was first acquired </span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 14px;">or created subject to an enforceable or lawful undertaking, restriction or obligation.</span>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref47" name="footnote47" title="Go back to footnote reference 47 in the text">47</a>.  I do not ignore the considerations that flow from Article 10 of the ECHR and s. 10 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981(as to which there is no material difference in principle: see<span style="font-style:italic"> Camelot<span style="font-style:italic"> Group</span><span style="font-style:italic"> plc</span><span style="font-style:italic"> v</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Centaur</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Communications</span> [1999] QB</span>
