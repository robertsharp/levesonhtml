<h1>CHAPTER 4<br/>PHONE HACKING: THE EXPANDING IMPACT OF OPERATION CARYATID</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This Inquiry was ultimately directed because of the wide scale public revulsion at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reported conduct of one or more journalists from the News of the World (NoTW) in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intercepting messages left on the mobile telephone of Milly Dowler: this type of interception</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been referred to colloquially as phone hacking. Having said that, however, there was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also increasing public concern about the apparent lack of appropriate investigation by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) into the conduct of a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the extent of the involvement of the NoTW (precipitated by increasing disclosure arising</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out of civil litigation). The consequence (prior to the disclosures about Milly Dowler) was that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the then Acting Commissioner, Tim Godwin, had re-opened the investigation into the NoTW</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">which had started in 2006; substantial resources were devoted to it. Not the least important</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reason for this concern was the increasingly vocal allegation that the relationship between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">senior executives at the NoTW and senior officers at the MPS had influenced or affected the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">direction of the investigation; the allegation itself had the potential to cause serious damage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the reputation of the police generally.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is therefore not surprising that the Terms of Reference for Part 1 of the Inquiry specifically</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">require it to consider the culture, practices and ethics of the press including contacts with,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the relationship between, the press and the police along with the conduct of each. They</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also require recommendations as to how future concerns about press behaviour should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dealt with by all the relevant authorities, including the police, the prosecuting and regulatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">authorities and Parliament.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This part of the Report, therefore deals with a wide range of issues including, in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Caryatid:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) whether the nature of the relationship between the police and the media explains why</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the police did not pursue journalists other than Clive Goodman in 2006 and why the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation was not re-opened following expressed concerns in 2009 and 2010;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) the nature and extent of any relationship between News International (NI) and senior</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">officers who were or became involved in this operation and the extent (if at all) to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which any relationship influenced directly or indirectly the way in which operational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decisions were approached;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) in the event that investigating officers or those with an operational role in connection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the investigation did not themselves have any relevant relationship, whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">knowledge or understanding of the existence of such a relationship between NI and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their superiors was taken into account when they approached decisions; and;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) in order to make recommendations as to the future, the approach and response to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the prosecuting authorities</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more generally.</span>
<!--new page--><p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the other side of the same investigation, it is also necessary to consider (as part of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">culture, practices and ethics of the press) the response to the police investigation of NI, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Press Complaints Commission (PCC), and the Culture, Media and Sports Committee and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Home Affairs Committee of the House of Commons. The part played by the PCC also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deserves detailed consideration in the context of a consideration of the effectiveness of any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">new regulatory regime.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Given the pivotal role that Operation Caryatid has played in the background that has given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rise to this Inquiry and the focus, in part, on criticisms of the MPS for what is perceived to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be its failure properly to investigate what emerged from this investigation, it is necessary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to set out precisely what happened in some detail, evaluating decisions that were made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as they were made and in the light of the prevailing circumstances. That is because I must</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">address the allegation that the MPS deliberately held back on a full investigation (and further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation in 2009 and 2010) because of a link with NI. In my ruling of 4 May 2012 in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to the operation of rule 13 of the Inquiry Rules 2006 to the MPS, I said<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> :</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;If not because of the influence of the press, why did the police not go further with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">OperationCaryatidorinvestigatetheMulcairenotebookinmoredetail(particularlyas</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a number of officers were concerned that it more than justified further examination)?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Why was it that the articles in The Guardian and the New York Times were so quickly</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">dismissedwithoutfurtherinvestigationbeingundertaken?Inmyjudgment,answering</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">those questions would be a critical part of the exercise both to assuage the legitimate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public concern that caused the conduct of the police to be included in the Inquiry in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the first place but also to justify any conclusions that I reach as to future conduct of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the relationship between press and police&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I concluded that answering these questions could give rise to criticism and I decided to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach the MPS, individual police officers, the CPS and counsel on that basis. Given that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the statements of a number of police officers used for the Inquiry were those prepared for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other proceedings, therefore, it is not surprising that, in response to notices under rule 13,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">additional material has been forthcoming. I have dealt with it in the Report and directed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that additional statements, establishing the facts put before me, should be provided and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">treated as part of the evidence of the Inquiry. Where new issues have arisen, I have identified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them but, in fairness, declined to determine any such issue adverse to any individual: to do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">otherwise would have been to require further rule 13 notices if not further oral hearings.</span>

<h3>The complaint</h3>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In December 2005, the Royal Household reported to the Royalty Protection Department of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the MPS that it was concerned that the voicemail messages of Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Helen Asprey, respectively the private and personal secretaries to Princes William and Harry,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were the subject of unlawful interception. Information had been appearing in the press, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular in the column of Clive Goodman, the Royal editor at the NoTW, which suggested</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">knowledge of the content of voicemail messages left on their mobile phones.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Head of the Royalty Protection Department, Commander Loughborough, approached</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Deputy Assistant Commissioner (Specialist Operations) Peter Clarke (now retired) who was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the head of the anti-terrorism branch of the MPS (then known as SO13). Given the potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">threat to the safety of members of the Royal Family and the sensitivities surrounding them,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke decided that SO13 would investigate the matter and would do so covertly (in</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">order to avoid alerting potential suspects).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> Mr Clarke sought to safeguard the secrecy of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation by ensuring only very few officers were aware of it. He explained that the need</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for operational security was one of the factors that weighed in his mind when deciding to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">keep the investigation within SO13,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> where the investigators were developed vetted.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Given the code name Operation Caryatid, Mr Clarke had ultimate operational oversight of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the investigation. He set its parameters and strategy<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> and was answerable to the Assistant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner (Specialist Operations), Andy Hayman. Mr Hayman has described himself as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accountable for the investigation but not responsible for day-to-day decision-making,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> nor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personally involved in formulating strategy.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> He received briefings from Mr Clarke.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Deputy Commissioner, at the time, Sir Paul Stephenson, played no apparent role in any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant events in 2005/2006. The then Commissioner, Lord Blair, said that his knowledge of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the entire investigation was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;&#8230;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> limited</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> short</span><span style="font-style:italic"> briefings</span><span style="font-style:italic"> imparted</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> few</span><span style="font-style:italic"> minutes</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> very</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Royal Family, for whose security he had ultimate responsibility, he would not have expected</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to have been informed of the case at all.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-10"><a href="#para1-10" name="para1-10">1.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Senior Investigating Officer (SIO), Detective Superintendent Philip Williams (now</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Detective Chief Superintendent (DCS) Williams),<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> was responsible for implementing the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">strategy set by Mr Clarke, for the daily conduct of the investigation and for providing him</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with regular personal briefings.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup> Otherwise, DCS Williams reported to Mr Clarke through his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">senior officers, DCS Tim White and Commander John McDowell.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup> By May 2006, Commander</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">McDowell was succeeded by Commander Loughborough.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-11"><a href="#para1-11" name="para1-11">1.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">From 18 April 2006, the Investigating Officer (IO) was Detective Chief Inspector Keith Surtees</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(now DCS Surtees). His role was to deliver the strategy by deciding and putting into effect the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">tactics.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup> DCS Surtees also personally briefed Mr Clarke<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup> and undertook the role of SIO when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams was absent. Towards the end of April 2006, Detective Sergeant Maberly (now a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Detective Inspector or DI) was appointed the case officer for Operation Caryatid and worked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Detective Constable Robert Green (now a Detective Sergeant).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup> DI Maberly explained</span>














<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">that his responsibility was to carry out the instructions of the SIO and IO and agreed that his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">role was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;hands</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on&#8221;</span> , dealing with the evidence as it came in and progressing the case.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-12"><a href="#para1-12" name="para1-12">1.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As standard practice, DCS Williams and DCS Surtees kept a decision log and prepared written</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">casereviews.Inthesecontemporaneousdocuments,theofficersrecordedkeydecisionsabout</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the case including their thoughts about the investigation, the details of periodic reviews and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their requests for advice from the CPS. Neither Mr Hayman nor Mr Clarke read the decision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">log or case reviews. Mr Clarke explained that he would not have expected to read them but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was briefed orally throughout the investigation. Mr Clarke was involved in the overall review</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the decisions made and how the investigation was progressing.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-13"><a href="#para1-13" name="para1-13">1.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In contrast with the standard practice adopted elsewhere in this Report, this Chapter refers to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">certain documents which are not on the Inquiry website or otherwise in the public domain.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">They are referred to in general terms only with some parts quoted in order to tell the full story.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The reason is that to publish them in full at this time might prejudice criminal investigations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and future trials. Although each has been closely examined during the course of the Inquiry,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">therefore, hyperlinked references to these documents cannot be provided.</span>

<h2>2. The collection of evidence</h2>

<h3>The covert phase</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-1"><a href="#para2-1" name="para2-1">2.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke defined the parameters of Operation Caryatid as follows: to investigate the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unauthorised interception of voicemail messages in the Royal Household; to prosecute those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsible if possible; and to take all necessary steps to prevent this type of abuse of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">telephone system in the future.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first step taken by DCS Williams was to establish whether or not a third party had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accessing the voicemail messages of Mr Lowther-Pinkerton and Ms Asprey without their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">permission.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup> At that stage Vodafone and O2, the respective service providers, maintained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that they had not appreciated that it was possible to listen to another person&#8217;s voicemail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">messages without their knowledge or permission.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup> Indeed at that time none of the service</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">providers admitted to being aware of this capability.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence of DCS Williams was that it was only due to the tenacity of DI Kevin Southworth</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(now Detective Superintendent Southworth) who worked with Vodafone and their engineers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the police discovered how mobile phone voicemail systems worked. It was the case,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apparently, that the service providers had limited ability to establish precisely what was</span>






<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">happening within any given voicemail system.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup> They could not, for instance, determine</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether a voicemail message (whether new or old) existed within a voicemail box at any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular time.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup> Although it was possible to identify outside or potential &#8220;rogue&#8221; numbers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dialling into a person&#8217;s voicemail box, the available software could not identify whether or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not the &#8220;rogue&#8221; number had listened to any messages.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup> They also could not assist with how</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">often the illegal access was taking place or how widespread it was.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-4"><a href="#para2-4" name="para2-4">2.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By 30 January 2006, with the assistance of Vodafone&#8217;s engineers, the police had established</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that a number of outside or potential &#8220;rogue&#8221; numbers had been calling in to Mr Lowther-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Pinkerton&#8217;s voicemail box, using his unique voicemail access number.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup> One of those &#8220;rogue&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">numbers was traced to Mr Goodman&#8217;s home address.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams immediately recognised the possible implications of this apparent vulnerability</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in voicemail systems and recorded in the decision log that they could be quite far reaching</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">among the mobile phone service providers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref28" href="#footnote28">28</a></sup> It is appropriate to note that he was:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;at</span><span style="font-style:italic"> pains</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to ensure that no one company was singled out as being particularly at risk/fault because to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an extent, we only knew what we knew from those companies who had software that could</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">give an indication of potential interception.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref29" href="#footnote29">29</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Despiteacknowledginghowwidespreadthepracticewaslikelytobe,DCSWilliamsmaintained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the focus of the investigation on the Royal Household (not least because the enquiry was still</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in its early stages) with a view to establishing whether what the police had discovered was a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one-off set of occurrences or something more systematic.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref30" href="#footnote30">30</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The police therefore obtained Mr Goodman&#8217;s telephone records (or &#8220;outgoing call data&#8221;) in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">order to ascertain whom he was calling.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref31" href="#footnote31">31</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 9 March 2006 there was a case review meeting involving Mr Clarke, DCS Williams, DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">White and DCI Paul Greenwood. It was decided at that meeting that the lines of enquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would remain focussed predominantly on Mr Lowther-Pinkerton&#8217;s voicemail box and the link</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Mr Goodman. As regards Mr Goodman, the investigation was to focus on establishing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether or not he was attempting to access other voicemail accounts and whether or not his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">actions were limited to the Royal Household.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref32" href="#footnote32">32</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 4 April 2006 DCS Williams prepared a written review of the case.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref33" href="#footnote33">33</a></sup> He recorded that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">following an analysis of the outgoing call data from Mr Goodman&#8217;s home phone number, five</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to six potential victims, all within the Royal Household, had been identified. The police had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ascertained that Mr Goodman had been making a significant number of phone calls to Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lowther-Pinkerton and these other members of the Royal Household over a sustained period</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of time. In the review, DCS Williams indicated that guidance would be sought from the CPS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to the two main offences that he had identified as arising from Mr Goodman&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">actions.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref34" href="#footnote34">34</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first of the two offences about which the police sought advice was unauthorised access to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">computer material contrary to s1 of the Computer Misuse Act 1990 (CMA); this is a summary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only offence attracting a maximum six months&#8217; imprisonment. The second offence was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interception of a telecommunication system contrary to s1 of the Regulation of Investigatory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Powers Act 2000 (RIPA), an indictable offence attracting a maximum two years&#8217; imprisonment.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">S1(1)(b) of RIPA makes it a criminal offence for a person &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> intentionally</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> without</span><span style="font-style:italic"> lawful</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">authority to intercept, at any place in the United Kingdom, any communication in the course</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of its transmission by means of a public telecommunication system<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span></span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams also set out in the review his understanding that the s1 of RIPA offence would not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be committed unless the interception took place before the intended recipient had listened</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the message. This has been referred to during the Inquiry by reference to the analogy of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an &#8220;unopened envelope&#8221; and as the &#8220;narrow interpretation&#8221; (the &#8220;wide interpretation&#8221;, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contrast, being that the timing of the interception would be immaterial to the commission of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the offence so that it would not matter whether or not the intended recipient or anyone else</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">entitled to access the voicemail system had done so). He noted that the practice of voicemail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interception:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;... was highly unlikely to be limited to Goodman alone and is probably quite</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">widespread amongst those who would be interested in such access &#8211; a much wider</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">security issue within the UK and potentially worldwide&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-12"><a href="#para2-12" name="para2-12">2.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This case review also demonstrated that, at this early stage, DCS Williams was concerned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the pressure on resources. He recorded that: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> taking</span><span style="font-style:italic"> this</span><span style="font-style:italic"> inquiry</span><span style="font-style:italic"> forward</span><span style="font-style:italic"> will</span><span style="font-style:italic"> impact</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on core SO13 operations and the resource implications for a prosecution could be significant<span style="font-style:normal"> .&#8221;</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The &#8220;resource implications&#8221; referred to by DCS Williams in the context of core operations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conducted by SO13 need hardly be made explicit. The terrorist threat in 2006 remained at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the highest level and must legitimately have been assessed as being at a totally different</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">order of priority to voicemail interception.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref35" href="#footnote35">35</a></sup> At the same time, however, the need to keep</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the investigation secret and the need to maintain the confidence of the Royal Family was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">militating against transferring the investigation out of SO13.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By 13 April 2006 nine potential victims within the Royal Household had been identified. DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Williams decided that only six of them would be notified that they were potential victims.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Those six included three members of the Royal Family itself. DCS Williams noted in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision log of that day that:</span>



<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; extending the circle of knowledge concerning what is still a highly sensitive covert</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enquiry runs the risk of the nature of the enquiry becoming more publicly known and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">possibly alerting suspect(s), thereby preventing the opportunity for offenders to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">brought to justice and/or other appropriate security and commercial interests to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fully considered once the full facts are known.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-14"><a href="#para2-14" name="para2-14">2.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By 18 April 2006 the investigation had reached a turning point: it was capable of moving into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a phase of evidence-gathering for the purposes of a prosecution. DCS Williams recorded in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the decision log that he had raised with Mr Clarke, Commander McDowell and DCS White his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern about continuing with the investigation given the pressure on resources:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I&#8217;mraisingtomyseniormanagementthatifwetakethisforwardtoafinalprosecution</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and it gets played out in court, given the fact that we are under huge, huge pressure</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in terms of our counter-terrorism operations, how is it right that the anti-terrorist</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">branch is dedicated [sic] investigating resources to something that actually is not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">terrorism? &#8230; Equally, there were valid arguments for why we should retain it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke decided that the investigation would continue with a view to prosecution and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would continue within SO13.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup> DCS Williams therefore asked for and obtained additional</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigative resources.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref38" href="#footnote38">38</a></sup> DCS Williams explained the stage the investigation had reached as</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref39" href="#footnote39">39</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;My parameters remained in terms of keeping the investigation focused on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">primary victims supported by an uplift in resourcing to enable the evidential gathering</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">phase to begin in earnest.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-16"><a href="#para2-16" name="para2-16">2.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams gave evidence that when looking ahead to a potential trial, his principal concerns</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were maintaining the confidence of the victims and presenting the case in the clearest and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">most straightforward way possible. He put it in his the statement (prepared for judicial review</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proceedings against the MPS<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup> ) that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref41" href="#footnote41">41</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In terms of securing the confidence and willingness for any &#8216;victims&#8217; to be willing to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">give evidence in court my strategy was to try to prove the offences based on technical</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">evidence rather than bringing into a public arena who might have been leaving</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">messages for whom and almost inevitably, what the content of any message might</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be by way of proof it existed. Equally I wanted to be able to present the case in a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">clear and concise manner to ensure the best chance of a successful prosecution and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">thereafter provide the greatest sentencing powers.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-17"><a href="#para2-17" name="para2-17">2.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In short, DCS Williams was anxious to ensure that the prosecution could be &#8220;ring-fenced&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so as to avoid any member of the Royal Family being placed in the potentially embarrassing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">position of giving evidence and to avoid the examination of the actual content of any of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the intercepted voicemail messages. In other words, he wished to confine the evidence for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the prosecution to witness evidence from members of staff within the Royal Household (as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opposed to members of the Royal Family) and to technical data relating to the interceptions.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not correct to interpret the use by DCS Williams of the term &#8220;ring-fence&#8221; as an intention</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or attempt to rule out the investigation of other potential victims.</span>






<!--new page--><p id="para-id-2-18"><a href="#para2-18" name="para2-18">2.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 20 April 2006 DCS Williams and DCS Surtees had a meeting with Carmen Dowd, Head of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Special Crime Division at the CPS.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup> Ms Dowd was responsible for the provision of legal advice</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to the investigation and eventually for prosecution decisions. At the meeting, DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Williams and DCS Surtees raised the question of how s1 of RIPA should be interpreted. DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Surtees recalled specifically the use of the analogy of the unopened envelope.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup> They also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">raised the strategic and presentational question of whether the prosecution could be &#8220;ring-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fenced&#8221; in the manner described in the paragraph above.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref44" href="#footnote44">44</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-19"><a href="#para2-19" name="para2-19">2.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 25 April 2006, via email, Ms Dowd provided the police with preliminary advice. She</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indicated that both the offence under s1 of RIPA and the offence under s1 of CMA were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">engaged. As for s1 of RIPA, Ms Dowd reserved her position, but gave the provisional indication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the &#8220;narrow interpretation&#8221; was correct. She put it in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref45" href="#footnote45">45</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; the offences under Section 1 of RIPA, would as far as I can see only relate to such</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">messages that had not been previously accessed by the recipient. However, this area</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is very much untested and further consideration will need to be given to this. Again,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the actual technical evidence would need to be carefully considered before any firm</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">view could be taken about whether the offence is capable of being proved. Unless</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the evidence is capable of showing all of the details we discussed (length of original</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">message, length of call to recipient&#8217;s voicemail etc) it is unlikely that we could proceed</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with the technical evidence alone.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-20"><a href="#para2-20" name="para2-20">2.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ms Dowd also advised that the prosecution could be &#8220;ring-fenced&#8221; in order to avoid the need</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for a member of the Royal Family to give evidence. Finally, it is correct to point out that in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the context of this preliminary advice Ms Dowd did not mention the possibility of charging</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the inchoate offence of conspiracy under the Criminal Law Act 1977, or the consequences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of relying on an agreement to intercept messages which would not require proof of an</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">&#8220;unopened envelope&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-21"><a href="#para2-21" name="para2-21">2.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is no sensible basis for suggesting that this provisional legal advice, given by Ms Dowd,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the interpretation of s1 of RIPA was influenced by any concern about offending NI and I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have no doubt that it was not. The fact that her initial view as to the proper interpretation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of s1 RIPA may not have been right therefore throws no light on the conduct of the police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the press. However, it is important to consider whether the fact that this initial view was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provided goes some way to explaining the apparent restraint shown by the MPS in limiting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the scope of the investigation. This preliminary advice certainly led DCS Williams to direct the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation towards obtaining technical evidence that the suspect was accessing voicemail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">messages before the intended recipient. In the words of DCS Williams:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;This was my understanding of the law from the beginning of the enquiry, it was a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">key question put to the CPS which they confirmed as being correct and thereafter it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was central to all our activity in terms of securing best evidence including the use of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an expert witness. If at any time the advice had been otherwise I would not have had</span>





<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to go the lengths I went to, to both shape the investigation and identify any &#8216;potential</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">victims&#8217; of this form of criminality.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-22"><a href="#para2-22" name="para2-22">2.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">To this extent, therefore, this initial advice did have a causative bearing on the subsequent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">course of the police investigation and it will be necessary to consider any continued impact it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might have had as time passed. In the light of Ms Dowd&#8217;s advice, however, the police cannot</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be criticised for adopting the investigative approach described by DCS Williams. It goes further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because it would have been irresponsible to ignore it, the risk being that, unless the allegation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of conspiracy was brought into play, they would fall at the first hurdle of any prosecution</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under s1 of RIPA should the court subsequently conclude that this narrow interpretation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was correct without there being evidence that the &#8220;envelope&#8221; had been unopened when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accessed by the accused. Although the CPS had been careful to advise that the CMA was an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">alternative statutory recourse, if the police wished to keep both legal avenues open in line</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with CPS advice it was necessary to obtain this specific evidence.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-23"><a href="#para2-23" name="para2-23">2.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Simply as a matter of chronology, it is worth noting that, on 25 April 2006, Andy Hayman met</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Andy Coulson and Neil Wallis (then Editor and Deputy Editor of NoTW) with Dick Fedorcio. At</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this stage, there was no evidence in the hands of the police that any NoTW journalist (other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than Mr Goodman) was implicated in voicemail interception. All have said that the issue of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail interception (still in its covert phase) was not discussed on that occasion, and as Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Garnham QC was able to develop in argument, an examination of the chronology of decision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">making within the MPS at this point demonstrates that nothing discussed at that dinner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could have resulted in any favour shown to NI.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup> In the circumstances, although I understand</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">why it is contended that the contrary cannot be excluded, I am satisfied that the police did</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nothing to alert the editors as to what was going on: it does, however, serve to underline</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the importance of care in relation to contacts with any organisation an employee of which is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being investigated simply because of the perception that favours could be exchanged.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-24"><a href="#para2-24" name="para2-24">2.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The story moves on to 9 May 2006 when DCS Williams recorded in an &#8220;Enquiry Update&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup> that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the police had discovered another potential suspect, a &#8220;Paul Williams&#8221; (which transpired to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be an alias used by Mr Mulcaire).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref49" href="#footnote49">49</a></sup> In the course of its own internal enquiry O2 had traced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">audio recordings of a man calling himself &#8220;Paul Williams&#8221; phoning O2 customer services and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">asking for pin numbers for voicemail accounts to be re-set to default settings. He held himself</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out as an O2 employee who was authorised to have access to customer information and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to make such requests. O2 discovered that on two occasions &#8220;Paul Williams&#8221; asked for Ms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Asprey&#8217;s pin number to be reset to default, and that this had been carried out.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-25"><a href="#para2-25" name="para2-25">2.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the update DCS Williams set out three options to be considered by the senior management.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Option one was that there be no further investigation with the intention of prosecution.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Option two was to hand over the investigation to another police unit; option three was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to commence a formal investigation to prosecute those intercepting the Royal Household</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail messages and<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> tandem</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> above</span><span style="font-style:italic"> establish</span><span style="font-style:italic"> whether</span><span style="font-style:italic"> or</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> there</span><span style="font-style:italic"> are</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">evidential links to the potentially wider unauthorised intrusion/access suspected by O2&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><span style="font-style:normal"> He</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recommended the third option over the short-term, and provided a very perceptive rationale</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in this way:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; we have discovered a vulnerability that exists within the mobile telephone industry</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whereby unscrupulous people could intrude upon the privacy of the vast majority of</span>



<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the public through unauthorised access to voicemail. I suspect that the media world</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">may well be aware of this vulnerability and there may well be a host of people using</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this vulnerability for journalistic purposes. The Goodman connection is potentially</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an example of this, but the more sinister side would be that the knowledge could</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">equally be utilised by criminals whether that be in the general sense, for terrorism</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or to threaten national security. Therefore I believe that this matter has a significant</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public interest aspect to it particularly in terms of safety and security and risk to life.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams recorded at the end of the update that its contents had been briefed to DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">White and Commander Loughborough and that he had been advised that the enquiry would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remain within SO13 for the time being. In line with the preliminary advice from the CPS, he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then set about deciding how best to prove the interception of voicemail messages before</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they had been heard by the intended recipient. DCS Williams decided to mount what he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">termed a &#8220;sting operation&#8221; (although this is a misnomer because the operation did not involve</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deception) which amounted to allocating a test period over around three weeks in May and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">June 2006 during which the relevant activity on the mobile phones of Mr Lowther-Pinkerton</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Ms Asprey would be monitored.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-27"><a href="#para2-27" name="para2-27">2.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">With DCS Williams working abroad between 12 May and 5 June 2006, DCS Surtees oversaw</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this aspect of the operation the aim of which was to prove who was accessing messages</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">and to obtain evidence to establish that after a voicemail message had been left, the same</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">message was illicitly accessed before it was heard by the intended recipient.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">51</a></sup> During this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">test, Mr Lowther-Pinkerton and Ms Asprey were asked to retrieve their voicemail messages</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only at set times twice in every 24 hour period. Where either came across a message that was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">marked as an old message, but which he or she had not previously listened to, this prompted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further investigation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref52" href="#footnote52">52</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-28"><a href="#para2-28" name="para2-28">2.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Part of the strategy for the operation was to ascertain whether the service providers had the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">software capability to detect both the fact that a message had been left and the retrieval</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of unheard messages by one of the rogue numbers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup> It transpired that it was only through</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Vodafone&#8217;s &#8220;Vampire&#8221; data that the police could definitively prove the sequence of person</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A leaving a message on person B&#8217;s voicemail and person C dialling in and retrieving the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">message.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref54" href="#footnote54">54</a></sup> DI Maberly explained that &#8220;Vampire&#8221; data was an engineering or diagnostic tool</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">used by Vodafone to monitor how its systems were running, including its voicemail systems.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the process of monitoring the systems, it captured data relating to customers&#8217; accounts,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including when a voicemail message was left and when it was opened. However, this data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not retained for very long and so Vodafone needed to<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;harvest</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it&#8221;</span> on a regular basis.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref55" href="#footnote55">55</a></sup> DI</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Maberly had the impression that it would only exist for a matter of days or maybe a couple</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of weeks.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref56" href="#footnote56">56</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-29"><a href="#para2-29" name="para2-29">2.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Where &#8220;Vampire&#8221; data was not available, the fact that a voicemail message had been accessed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had to be deduced from the length of the incoming call to the voicemail box. The telephone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expert for the prosecution, David Bristowe, explained that the call would need to be at least</span>







<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">10 to 14 seconds long owing to the length of the recorded message which the caller would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have heard before accessing the voicemail message.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref57" href="#footnote57">57</a></sup> Therefore, where a call was at least</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">10 to 14 seconds in length, it could be inferred that the caller had listened to a voicemail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">message.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref58" href="#footnote58">58</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-30"><a href="#para2-30" name="para2-30">2.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">During the same period, the police carried out a surveillance operation on the home address</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Mr Goodman. The purpose was to prove that the telephone was in Mr Goodman&#8217;s hand at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the time of any relevant calls from that number into the voicemail systems being monitored.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-31"><a href="#para2-31" name="para2-31">2.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 15 May 2006 O2 informed the police that they had identified and contacted a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of customers whose voicemail accounts had potentially been accessed unlawfully. Two such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">customers, Max Clifford and &#8220;HJK&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup> had asked that the police be informed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref61" href="#footnote61">61</a></sup> This was highly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significant because these potential victims were not members of the Royal Household and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">therefore would not ostensibly have been of any interest to Mr Goodman (although the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW was later to argue that Mr Goodman had a wider remit than the Royal Household). At</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">around the same time, other service providers also gave the police details of possible victims</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although all but a very small number were linked to the Royal Household.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref62" href="#footnote62">62</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-32"><a href="#para2-32" name="para2-32">2.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 30 May 2006 Ms Dowd prepared a briefing on the current status of the investigation for</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), who at that time was Ken Macdonald QC (now Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Macdonald QC of River Glaven), and for the Attorney General.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref63" href="#footnote63">63</a></sup> This was conventional in any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case involving members of the Royal Family. In the briefing Ms Dowd explained the legal and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">technical issues, and stated:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; in addition to Goodman, another potential suspect has been identified as accessing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the UVM&#8217;s [sic] on a number of occasions and inquiries continue in relation to him.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I am told that in the media world he is widely suspected of being able to access</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mobiles &#8230; A vast number of UVM&#8217;s belonging to high profile individuals (politicians</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and celebrities) have been identified as being accessed without authority &#8211; these may</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be the subject of a wider investigation in due course. A number of the targets of these</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">unauthorised accesses have been informed &#8211; some of whom have declined to assist</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in a police investigation.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Macdonald QC asked to be kept closely informed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref64" href="#footnote64">64</a></sup> He was not asked to give an opinion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the case and he said it would have been surprising if he had been asked to do so.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref65" href="#footnote65">65</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-33"><a href="#para2-33" name="para2-33">2.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 31 May 2006 DCS Surtees prepared a written update on the investigation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref66" href="#footnote66">66</a></sup> As the briefing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given by Ms Dowd to the DPP indicated, the police had by then ascertained that one of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the &#8220;rogue&#8221; numbers accessing the voicemail boxes of Mr Lowther-Pinkerton and Ms Asprey</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">belonged to Mr Mulcaire. DCS Surtees identified the possibility that Mr Mulcaire and Paul</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Williams were one and the same person. The update referred to Max Clifford and &#8220;HJK&#8221; and</span>










<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">suggested that the investigation into potential victims outside the Royal Household should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be taken over by a team outside the anti-terrorist branch. Pursuing his recommendation that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the wider investigation should be undertaken by a different team, he also recorded that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had briefed the relevant officers.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-34"><a href="#para2-34" name="para2-34">2.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke decided to keep the investigation within the anti-terrorist branch and not to widen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the original parameters of the investigation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref67" href="#footnote67">67</a></sup> Mr Clarke described his thinking as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref68" href="#footnote68">68</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;As the investigation progressed it became clear that there may have been many</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other people being targeted by whoever was responsible for the interception, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there was potential for the investigation to become much wider. I took the decision</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that this was not appropriate for a number of reasons. In coming to the decision that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the parameters of the investigation had to remain tightly drawn it was obvious to me</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that a wider investigation would inevitably take much longer to complete. This would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">carry two unacceptable risks. First, that the investigation would be compromised and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">evidence lost and second, that the much wider range of people who we were learning</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were becoming the victims of this activity would continue to be victimised while the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation took its course. This would probably go on for many months and to my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mind this would be unacceptable.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-35"><a href="#para2-35" name="para2-35">2.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke rejected the option of informing the victims, in confidence. This was to enable the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation to continue:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref69" href="#footnote69">69</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It was not feasible to notify victims and continue with a wide ranging covert</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation, and if we had done so, it is inconceivable that the fact that there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was an enquiry into this matter would not have leaked, thereby compromising the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation and leading to the potential loss of evidence.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-36"><a href="#para2-36" name="para2-36">2.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke agreed that this decision not to widen the parameters of the investigation was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">probably made on or shortly after 31 May 2006 when DCS Surtees briefed him on the potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">breadth of the investigation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref70" href="#footnote70">70</a></sup> His evidence was that, when it was becoming clear that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police were looking at something endemic within a particular part of the media and that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there were more victims than they originally thought, he did seriously consider transferring</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the investigation from SO13 to a different department. He explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref71" href="#footnote71">71</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...Initially it was because by that stage my officers were very familiar with the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">quite complicated technical aspects of this offence&#8230;They had also engendered the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">confidenceoftheroyalhouseholdinthewayinwhichtheywereconductingthemselves</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the investigation, and because of the wider nature of what was happening, it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would have meant picking apart the investigation and perhaps hiving off one part to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">one department, keeping another part with us, and that would have not made any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sort of operational sense. So at that stage I decided it should stay where it was.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-37"><a href="#para2-37" name="para2-37">2.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In evidence DCS Surtees said that it was a<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;fair</span><span style="font-style:italic"> observation&#8221;</span> that it might be difficult</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to disentangle an investigation involving offences against the Royal Household from an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation involving other victims.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref72" href="#footnote72">72</a></sup> As a result, the police strategy was to continue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concentrating on arresting and prosecuting Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire and not (in the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as Iraq or Afghanistan could be leaked with the obvious security risks associated with</span>

<p id="para-id-2-38"><a href="#para2-38" name="para2-38">2.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 21 June 2006, DCS Williams prepared a further written update.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref75" href="#footnote75">75</a></sup> He recorded that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">through an analysis of the Vodafone &#8220;Vampire&#8221; data gathered during what he termed the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;sting operation&#8221;, the police had identified two voicemail &#8220;interceptions&#8221; in the &#8220;narrow&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sense<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref76" href="#footnote76">76</a></sup> by Mr Goodman and two by a phone number which was subsequently attributed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Mr Mulcaire.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref77" href="#footnote77">77</a></sup> He described this as<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> moment</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> reflection&#8221;</span> during which he put the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operation in its context.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref78" href="#footnote78">78</a></sup> DCS Williams concluded by setting out his concerns about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strain on resources caused by the burgeoning number of SO13 anti-terrorist operations and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the need, given the limited resources available, for a proportionate approach to Operation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Caryatid:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref79" href="#footnote79">79</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;At the moment I consider that I have enough resources to continue with this enquiry</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in terms of what is currently required, however I believe that it is important to</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">formally record that this investigation has been conducted against a backdrop of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sustained and increasing workload for SO13 since at least December 2005. Over that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">period the number of operations has increased from numbers in the 50&#8217;s to today at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">tasking where we have reached 72 active operations with a number of them posing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">significant life threatening risks. Today again at tasking, as in previous weeks, there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were requests for additional resource with there no longer being any spare capacity.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">This has resulted in some lower priority anti terrorist operations being placed on hold</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to release officers to higher priority operations. The level of the current workload is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">unprecedented and the assessment for the future is that this is unlikely to ease.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Operation Caryatid has been brought to its current status against this backdrop and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the need to balance resources against all anti terrorist operations. Subject to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">stages outlined above the scope of any future overt operational activity e.g. arrest/</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">searches will need to be balanced against the whole of SO13/CT priorities. These</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">comments are documented purely to reinforce how my decision-making has been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reached in terms of how to approach this enquiry in a proportionate manner.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-39"><a href="#para2-39" name="para2-39">2.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Meanwhile, the service providers continued to identify previously undiscovered potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">victims.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref80" href="#footnote80">80</a></sup> The decision not to widen the investigation was, however, maintained. On 6 July</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2006 DCS Surtees noted in the decision log that he was aware that there were potentially</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">numerous victims, at the hands of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire or others, but that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identifying all those victims would be<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;hugely</span><span style="font-style:italic"> time</span><span style="font-style:italic"> consuming&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref81" href="#footnote81">81</a></sup> In the context of what was</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">when concerns were being expressed about the way in which the investigation had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conducted), this is an important observation.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-40"><a href="#para2-40" name="para2-40">2.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 30 June 2006 the police prepared a written request for advice from the CPS.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref82" href="#footnote82">82</a></sup> The police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">informed the CPS that the telephone evidence indicated that:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) between 26 January 2005 and 24 April 2006 Mr Goodman&#8217;s landline had called the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unique voicemail access numbers of Mr Lowther-Pinkerton and Ms Asprey 145 times</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and 107 times respectively;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) between 22 February 2006 and 8 May 2006 a landline located in the offices of NI had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">called Ms Asprey&#8217;s unique voicemail access number;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) in May 2006 a landline number registered to an office leased by Mr Mulcaire had called</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the unique voicemail access numbers of Mr Lowther-Pinkerton and Ms Asprey five</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">times and 38 times respectively; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) the number relating to Mr Mulcaire&#8217;s office premises had called Mr Goodman&#8217;s mobile</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 14 July 2006, before the CPS responded to this request for advice from the police, Ms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Dowd sent another confidential briefing note to the DPP and the Attorney General.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref83" href="#footnote83">83</a></sup> Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Macdonald agreed that the briefing was premised on the narrow interpretation of s1 of RIPA.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref84" href="#footnote84">84</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, Ms Dowd expressed the view that offences of conspiracy between Mr Goodman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Mr Mulcaire to commit s1 of RIPA and s1 of CMA offences<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;may</span><span style="font-style:italic"> better</span><span style="font-style:italic"> reflect</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> alleged</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">criminality involved and enable a more comprehensive case to be presented&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref85" href="#footnote85">85</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-42"><a href="#para2-42" name="para2-42">2.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 18 July 2006 Ms Dowd advised the police in writing. She advised that the case against Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Goodman and Mr Mulcaire, at that stage limited to the Royal Household interceptions, was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;cogent and presentable and could proceed without the need to delve into the content of any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">messages left and/or retrieved&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref86" href="#footnote86">86</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> She</span><span style="font-style:normal"> also</span><span style="font-style:normal"> stated</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref87" href="#footnote87">87</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Whilst there are many aspects of the evidence which I would require to be clarified, it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is my initial assessment that offences under the CMA and RIPA 2000 may be provable.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">However, in addition, I would also be looking to consider an offence of conspiracy to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">commit those offences on the basis of other evidence being available &#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-43"><a href="#para2-43" name="para2-43">2.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is correct to observe that this was the first occasion on which the possibility of the criminality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being accommodated within the offence of conspiracy was mentioned by the CPS. As Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Macdonald pointed out in evidence, and reflected above, a charge of conspiracy would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not require proof that every interception had taken place before it had been accessed by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the intended recipient:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref88" href="#footnote88">88</a></sup> indeed, given that the offence was constituted by the agreement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rather than by the subsequent act or acts, it would probably be sufficient to prove a common</span>







<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">intention to intercept voicemail messages without examining exactly when such multiple</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accessing would be taking place.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-44"><a href="#para2-44" name="para2-44">2.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Also on 20 July 2006 DCS Williams prepared a further written update on the investigation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref89" href="#footnote89">89</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He noted that:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;there</span><span style="font-style:italic"> may</span><span style="font-style:italic"> well</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> much</span><span style="font-style:italic"> wider</span><span style="font-style:italic"> range</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;victims&#8217;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> indeed</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> suspect</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that Mulcaire could well be someone whose business it is to secure access to information</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">concerning a whole range of &#8216;VIPs&#8217;&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Identifying</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> options,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> again</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> included:</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;extend[ing] the investigation to include the full extent of this potential criminality which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would help to establish the seriousness of what we are facing<span style="font-style:italic"> .</span> &#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but he went on:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;However, to do this effectively the enquiry would probably have to remain covert,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which would leave my known and unknown victims vulnerable over a much greater</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">period of time. It would also require significant SO13 resources and the current</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">terrorist threat requires their deployment elsewhere against much higher threats to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public safety/life.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-45"><a href="#para2-45" name="para2-45">2.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Because of this, DCS Williams was of the view that Operation Caryatid should remain limited</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to victims within the Royal Household but that Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire should be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arrested as soon as possible in order to curtail the exposure of the victims to voicemail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interception. DCS Williams also had in mind that including more victims would be unlikely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to increase significantly the sentence that the offenders would receive; and that securing a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conviction as a deterrent to others would be best achieved through a clear and simple case.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He set out that the alternative to limiting Operation Caryatid would be:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; a much extended trial, numerous victim&#8217;s [sic], potentially more suspects with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a host of council [sic] all seeking to derail what could appear to be a far more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">complicated case ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">[whereas] &#8220;Once executive action is taken then all parties can be briefed re the security</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">issues and the phone companies can start to put in appropriate security measures</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and brief/reassure their customers &#8211; all of which will reduce public/personal harm ...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-46"><a href="#para2-46" name="para2-46">2.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the same update of 20 July 2006, DCS Williams also listed the factors which influenced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his view that the investigation should not be transferred out of SO13. His list included the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">following:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) that the support of the Royal Household was strongly based on the confidence it had in</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">SO13;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) that the relationships formed between SO13 and the service providers were crucial to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a successful prosecution;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) the importance of continuity of the investigation;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) that delays would be caused by transferring the investigation to another department</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because a new SIO would need to review the case and may have resource constraints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that might further delay the operation.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) the current team&#8217;s intimate knowledge of the case, which could not realistically be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">picked up in the same detail by a new team.</span>

<!--new page--><p id="para-id-2-47"><a href="#para2-47" name="para2-47">2.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams sought strategic guidance on this approach from Mr Clarke, who endorsed his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref90" href="#footnote90">90</a></sup> He then went on leave until 12 August 2006 so it fell to DCS Surtees to deal with</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">informationreceivedon26July2006totheeffectthatMrMulcairehadaccessedthevoicemail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Tessa Jowell, then a cabinet minister. DCS Surtees then noted in the decision log:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref91" href="#footnote91">91</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;As a result the position is that this changes the perception that as well as the Royal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Correspondent of the N.O.W filling up his editorial with Royal gossip the potential for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">operational Security breaches now not only surrounds the Royal household but also</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Cabinet Ministers.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When giving evidence, DCS Surtees agreed that his primary concern was then to stop the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail interception in the interests of national security.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref92" href="#footnote92">92</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-48"><a href="#para2-48" name="para2-48">2.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 2 August 2006 Ms Dowd discussed the case with leading counsel, David Perry QC. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Perry agreed during his evidence that the advice he gave was essentially that, first, there was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence in respect of four main substantive offences<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref93" href="#footnote93">93</a></sup> which established in any event that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the interception had taken place before the intended recipient had accessed the voicemail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">message concerned; and second, that in relation to the conspiracy charge, the issues about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether or not there needed to be an &#8220;unopened envelope&#8221; would not arise.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref94" href="#footnote94">94</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-49"><a href="#para2-49" name="para2-49">2.49</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Perry explained in his evidence that he also advised against charging Mr Mulcaire and Mr</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Goodman with CMA offences because asking a jury to deal with those allegations together</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with s1 of RIPA would be confusing;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref95" href="#footnote95">95</a></sup> furthermore, s1 of RIPA more accurately reflected the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conduct concerned.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref96" href="#footnote96">96</a></sup> Mr Perry also advised as to the possibility of obtaining a warrant under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) and the attendant difficulties which would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arise in relation to journalistic material.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref97" href="#footnote97">97</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-50"><a href="#para2-50" name="para2-50">2.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The only record that exists of the meeting on 2 August 2006 is an email sent by Ms Dowd to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the police on that day.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref98" href="#footnote98">98</a></sup> On the question of the interpretation of s1 of RIPA, Ms Dowd said</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the following in the email:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We have briefly discussed before the possibility of arguing that what we have termed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">our Computer Misuse Act offences might fall to be considered as RIPA offences &#8211; that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the issue has not definitively been argued. I was reticent about arguing the point in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this case. However, having considered the matter with Counsel we have concluded</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that we could properly argue the point &#8211; and in any event nothing would be lost as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we already have the 4 main clear RIPA offences (if not more I hear!).&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-51"><a href="#para2-51" name="para2-51">2.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As regards Ms Dowd&#8217;s use of the words<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;if</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> more</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hear&#8221;</span> , DCS Surtees was asked whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this was a reference to the possibility, at least, of additional co-conspirators. DCS Surtees</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disagreed and said that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref99" href="#footnote99">99</a></sup></span>










<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s more &#8230; that we&#8217;ve got more information/evidence coming from the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">telephone companies to talk about access to DDNs and the sequencing which we&#8217;re</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">concentrating on as opposed to more suspects.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-52"><a href="#para2-52" name="para2-52">2.52</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Pausing in the narrative, it is appropriate to comment on the approach of the police to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gathering of evidence and to the strategic decisions that were taken, particularly against the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context of the concern that this approach was or could have been affected by the relationship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between the MPS or its most senior officers and NI. The first point to make is that there is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no evidence (or even the slightest suggestion) of any relationship between NI, the NoTW</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or any of its employees and any officers involved in this enquiry from the Deputy Assistant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner (Mr Clarke) down through the detective ranks. Whilst each, as their roles</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">required, will have interacted with individuals from NI at certain times during their careers,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">theydidnotformsocialrelationships.MrClarkegaveevidenceastohislevelofinteractionwith</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals from NI, which, in spite of his senior position and high-profile role, was extremely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">limited. To the best of his knowledge he had never met or even spoken to Neil Wallis or Colin</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Myler (editor of the NoTW between the end of January 2007 and July 2011). He met Rebekah</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Brooks and Andy Coulson on one occasion in 2004. The purpose of that meeting was to make</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the media aware of the reality of the terrorist threat because there had been a great deal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of criticism in the media of the counter-terrorism effort and some commentators had been</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">saying that the terrorist threat was being exaggerated by the authorities for political or self-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">serving purposes.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref100" href="#footnote100">100</a></sup> At the meeting, they were unexpectedly (at least to Mr Clarke) joined by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rupert Murdoch.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref101" href="#footnote101">101</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-53"><a href="#para2-53" name="para2-53">2.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">TheonlyknownrelationshipwaswithMrClarke&#8217;sseniorofficer,MrHayman,andtheoccasions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in respect of which there is evidence of contact with NI in the relevant period will be clear;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there is no basis for suggesting that Mr Hayman was any more than peripherally involved in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the investigation; to such extent as he was involved in any way, it was solely because of his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibilities for overall command of Mr Clarke&#8217;s team. Neither do I believe that Mr Clarke</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or any of the other officers were or would have been affected by any such relationship.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-54"><a href="#para2-54" name="para2-54">2.54</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The peripheral nature of the involvement of Mr Hayman is illustrated by his evidence and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that of Mr Clarke. The evidence of Mr Hayman is that he allocated the investigation to Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Clarke, asked him to devise an investigation strategy and an operation,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref102" href="#footnote102">102</a></sup> and let him &#8220;get on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with it&#8221;. Mr Hayman only expected Mr Clarke to refer to him if Mr Clarke considered there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was something that Mr Hayman needed to brief up to the Commissioner or if Mr Clarke</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had insufficient resources.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref103" href="#footnote103">103</a></sup> Mr Hayman stressed that he was not involved in the detail of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Caryatid and stated that his degree of detachment was demonstrated by the fact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he did not know when the arrests or searches were going to take place.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref104" href="#footnote104">104</a></sup> Mr Hayman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">told the Inquiry that he could count on one hand the number of times he and Mr Clarke spoke</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the investigation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref105" href="#footnote105">105</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-55"><a href="#para2-55" name="para2-55">2.55</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke, in general agreement with the extent to which Mr Hayman had contact with him on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this issue said that he personally would have briefed Mr Hayman<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;probably</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> often&#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref106" href="#footnote106">106</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke could not remember specifically which issues he discussed with Mr Hayman except</span>







<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">that he certainly briefed Mr Hayman at the outset when it was discovered that Mr Goodman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Mr Mulcaire appeared to be responsible and<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;probably</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8230;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> run-up</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> arrest</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">phase&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref107" href="#footnote107">107</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> It</span><span style="font-style:normal"> is</span><span style="font-style:normal"> clear,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> therefore,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Hayman</span><span style="font-style:normal"> did</span><span style="font-style:normal"> not</span><span style="font-style:normal"> make</span><span style="font-style:normal"> any</span><span style="font-style:normal"> operational</span><span style="font-style:normal"> decisions</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not influence relevant decision-making, save to the extent that he did not disagree with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any of the decisions made by Mr Clarke.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref108" href="#footnote108">108</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-56"><a href="#para2-56" name="para2-56">2.56</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Moving on, I am entirely satisfied that each of the decisions taken was justified and based</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on reasoning that was clear, rational and entirely in keeping with the operational imperatives</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the police at that time. I recognise that the decision (which was revisited on a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occasions) not to expand the investigation beyond the Royal Household gives rise to concern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but there is no basis for arguing that it was based on oblique motives consequent on any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship with NI. Again, in the light of the circumstances prevailing (especially related</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the extensive demands on police time in relation to terrorism), it was understandable,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justified and appropriate.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-57"><a href="#para2-57" name="para2-57">2.57</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Elaborating on the reasons for these conclusions, it is clear that during the pre-arrest phase</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the investigation DCS Williams, DCS Surtees and, indeed, Mr Clarke were aware that there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could be a wide range of other victims but that the priority which needed to be given to counter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terrorism, the need for secrecy and the belief that arresting Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would send out the strongest signal and bring this criminality to an end all militated against</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">expansion. The contemporaneous decision logs and case reviews identify this reasoning; DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Williams spoke of the process as involving<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> balance</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> risk</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> harm&#8221;</span> which would be judged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in particular against the imminence of a threat to life and it is equally clear that judgements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">continued to be made throughout this time on that basis.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref109" href="#footnote109">109</a></sup> Such a decision, however, does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">leave open the need to devise, institute and execute an appropriate exit strategy. All these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decisions were re-visited after the operation moved through the arrest and prosecution phases</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and require re-examination as the extent of the evidence came to be known whereupon the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">need for an exit strategy to deal with the unresolved issues surrounding the investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">became all the more pressing. It is to these phases that I now turn.</span>

<h3>The arrest and searches</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-58"><a href="#para2-58" name="para2-58">2.58</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 8 August 2006, the police arrested Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire and searched over</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">13 premises and vehicles, including their home addresses.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref110" href="#footnote110">110</a></sup> Attempts were also made to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">searchtheofficesofNIinWapping<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref111" href="#footnote111">111</a></sup> althoughtominimisetheriskofencounteringjournalistic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material, the CPS had advised that the search of those premises should be confined to Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Goodman&#8217;s desk and the finance offices.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref112" href="#footnote112">112</a></sup> The objectives of the search included looking for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence implicating other NoTW journalists. DCS Surtees explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref113" href="#footnote113">113</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The intention behind searching the offices of News Corporation was to seize all</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">material relating to Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire to establish the extent of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">their unlawful practises [sic] and also to establish the level of knowledge of NOTW</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">concerning this illegal activity. At no point was a decision made by D/Supt Williams</span>







<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or I to not investigate the wider possible involvement of NOTW. Despite the legislative</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">challenges to searching journalistic premises, the warrant would be executed as I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was eager to gain entry to the offices of NOTW for two reasons: The first was to seek</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and recover any additional evidence relevant to Clive Goodman&#8217;s activities and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">second was to ascertain whether any other evidence existed implicating others within</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the NOTW in a wider conspiracy, hence my reference on application for the section 8</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">PACE warrant to the financial office.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-59"><a href="#para2-59" name="para2-59">2.59</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DI Maberly explained that the police intended to seize records relating to financial payments</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Mr Mulcaire (including documents recording the dates of such payments, the reasons for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the payments and those authorising the payments) and plans or directories relating to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">locations of telephone extensions within the offices.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref114" href="#footnote114">114</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-60"><a href="#para2-60" name="para2-60">2.60</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is significant and a matter of regret that the plans for the search were substantially thwarted.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Surtees described how the searching officers were obstructed by NI personnel:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref115" href="#footnote115">115</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There was some real difficulty in conducting the search at News International.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There were I think four of my officers who actually got into the premises before News</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">International barred the rest of my officers from going into News International. We</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">got to the desk of Goodman, we seized some material from the desk of Goodman.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There was a safe on his desk, which was unopened. My officers were confronted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with photographers, who were summonsed from other parts of News International,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and they were taking photographs of the officers. A number of night or news editors</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">challenged the officers around the illegality of their entry into News International.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">They were asked to go to a conference room until lawyers could arrive to challenge</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the illegality of the section 18(1) and 18(5) and section 8 PACE authorities, and it was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">described to me as a tense stand-off by the officer leading the search.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The officer tried to get our forensic management team, our search officers into the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">building. They were refused entry, they were left outside. Our officers were effectively</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">surrounded and photographed and not assisted in any way, shape or form. That</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">search was curtailed. Some items were taken. The search did not go to the extent I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wanted it to.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-61"><a href="#para2-61" name="para2-61">2.61</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On being informed of the level of obstruction, DCS Surtees, who was not present at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">search, instructed the small team to search Mr Goodman&#8217;s desk only and leave the premises</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with whatever they had recovered.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref116" href="#footnote116">116</a></sup> A locked safe and computer had to be left behind. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">financial records were not searched.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-62"><a href="#para2-62" name="para2-62">2.62</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">No subsequent search (with a larger team of police officers) was arranged. DCS Surtees</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> think</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> moment</span><span style="font-style:italic"> had</span><span style="font-style:italic"> been</span><span style="font-style:italic"> lost</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span><span style="font-style:italic"> regard</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> information</span><span style="font-style:italic"> we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> sought.</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It, I think, had gone, quite frankly&#8221;.<span style="font-style:normal"> He</span><span style="font-style:normal"> agreed</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> what</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> meant</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> NI</span><span style="font-style:normal"> might</span><span style="font-style:normal"> have</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hidden or destroyed incriminating information.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref117" href="#footnote117">117</a></sup> This is a disturbing conclusion and justifies</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a re-evaluation of the way in which PACE operates when seeking to deal with allegations of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal conduct by journalists while at the same time protecting the essential requirements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a free press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref118" href="#footnote118">118</a></sup></span>





<!--new page--><p id="para-id-2-63"><a href="#para2-63" name="para2-63">2.63</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The search of Mr Mulcaire&#8217;s home and business premises was very much more successful:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the police seized some 11,000 pages of papers. These papers have been referred to in various</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ways including as &#8220;Mulcaire&#8217;s notebook&#8221; and &#8220;the Mulcaire archive&#8221; and, in part, consisted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of lists of names, with addresses, landline and mobile phone numbers; in some cases, there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were unique voicemail access numbers and pin numbers along with contact details for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">network service provider. Additionally, of potential importance was a first name in the top</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">left hand corner of the page. In a number of cases in respect of which Mr Goodman was later</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecuted, that name or &#8220;corner name&#8221; (as it has since been termed) was &#8220;Clive&#8221;. Given the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">present status of the investigation and prosecution of journalists in relation to this material,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is not appropriate to go further.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-64"><a href="#para2-64" name="para2-64">2.64</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">What can be added is that the 11,000 pages of documents included what has since been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described as the &#8220;for Neville&#8221; email.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref119" href="#footnote119">119</a></sup> This email (dated 29 June 2005) was apparently sent by</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In addition to this mountain of paper, the police also seized from Mr Mulcaire audio cassettes,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">CD roms, white boards showing pin numbers, security codes and bank details of potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">victims.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref121" href="#footnote121">121</a></sup> There was also a contract between Mr Mulcaire and the NoTW according to which</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further material related to payments from the NoTW, including a number of invoices</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">showing apparent payments to Mr Mulcaire.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref123" href="#footnote123">123</a></sup> Suffice to say that he was paid a weekly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">retainer amounting to no less than &#163;2,019 per week. In addition to the weekly retainer he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also received other payments, typically of &#163;250, which appear to have been linked to work</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on specific stories.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-67"><a href="#para2-67" name="para2-67">2.67</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the day of the arrests, the MPS notified the public that there were victims other than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those associated with the Royal Household. Its press release stated that:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;As</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> result</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Following the arrests, NI instructed BCL Burton Copeland Solicitors (Burton Copeland) to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">respond on their behalf to any enquiries or requests from the police.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref125" href="#footnote125">125</a></sup> How the firm went</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about discharging that responsibility is examined below but the evidence given by Colin Myler</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was that the role of Burton Copeland was to:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref126" href="#footnote126">126</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;act as the go-betweens and the word I&#8217;ve used before is a bridge head, as I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">understand, between the police and the company, so that anything that the police</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wanted Burton Copeland would facilitate, so that there was full transparency and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there was no opportunity to accuse the company of being an obstruction to what the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">police were looking for.&#8221;</span>

<h3>The interviews</h3>

<p id="para-id-2-69"><a href="#para2-69" name="para2-69">2.69</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 8 and 9 August 2006 Mr Mulcaire and Mr Goodman were separately interviewed by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">junior rank detectives. Both were warned of their right to remain silent and, exercising that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">right, both declined to answer any questions giving &#8216;no comment&#8217; responses.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref127" href="#footnote127">127</a></sup> At this stage,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">however, what is of interest is not what they might have said but the questions themselves</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for although, at that stage, the police would only have been able to undertake a cursory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examination of the documents seized, they indicate just how much the police knew or</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">appreciated about the likely extent of Mr Mulcaire&#8217;s activities and, at least to some extent,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who his victims were.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-70"><a href="#para2-70" name="para2-70">2.70</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">During the interviews of Mr Mulcaire on 9 August 2006, the interviewing officers referred to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Abi Titmuss, and various sports people, offenders and members of the Royal Family (whose</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">names have been redacted). Among the allegations put to Mr Mulcaire, Detective Constable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Gallagher asked the following questions:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I&#8217;m gonna cross reference something in this document. There&#8217;s a reference to Tessa</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Jowell and then in brackets, sorry circled above it says MP, gives a telephone number</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">DDMI, PIN number. [Redacted] is crossed out David Mills and then it says [redacted],</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">gives an account number and network Voda. David Mills is written underneath and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it says husband and gives a telephone number for him and then (INAUDIBLE) refer to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">another document found in the kitchen cupboard of your home, exhibit WAB/61 is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">another sheet of A4 paper which also refers to Tessa Jowell and that has a telephone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">number there. If I can just show this to you, on the left hand side at the top of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">page it says Tessa [redacted]. Now that sounds to me, that reads to me like you&#8217;ve</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">written down somebody&#8217;s conversation. Is that what&#8217;s taken place here?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Have you intercepted her voicemail?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Either of Tessa Jowell or her husband?&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-71"><a href="#para2-71" name="para2-71">2.71</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DC Gallagher also asked the following question, which made clear that the police had evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to suggest that Lord Prescott had been the victim of voicemail interception:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref128" href="#footnote128">128</a></sup></span>




<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Another page here, this has got the name John Prescott. There&#8217;s another name</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">underneath, first of all it says advisor and then the name Joan Hammel. You&#8217;ve got her</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">telephone numbers and DM1 numbers, password numbers and Vodafone passwords</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that I&#8217;ve already mentioned and an address in NW1. Have you got that information</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to access John Prescott&#8217;s network or that of his advisors?&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-72"><a href="#para2-72" name="para2-72">2.72</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the extent of the work that Mr Mulcaire was performing for the paper, DC Gallagher asked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the following:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Okay. We&#8217;ve got pages and pages of information here, at least another 30 odd pages,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">various names. Again you&#8217;ve got instances of telephone numbers, PIN numbers, etc. I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">just picked out ones which are relevant to this enquiry that we put to you so far. Okay,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the last page in this document is an email message. This is very relevant ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;This suggests that you do have a contract, a long term contract with the News of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the World and that would account for you being paid up to &#163;2,000 a week by them.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Can you recall in the last interview, yeah, I put it to you that you were on a retainer</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by News of the World to do research for them. I hadn&#8217;t seen that email at the time and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that supports what I said earlier on, remind you that you were being paid by them a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fixed fee just to do regular for them at their behest. They&#8217;re asking you to do research</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for them and you&#8217;re providing them with information and on top of that, when you</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">get a good one, then you have a separate contract for that particular job and you&#8217;re</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the business of delving into people&#8217;s personal lives inappropriately, breaking the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">law to intercept telecommunications and that&#8217;s part and parcel of what you do. Have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you got anything to say to that?&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-73"><a href="#para2-73" name="para2-73">2.73</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DC Green returned to the issue on a later occasion and asked the following question:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; I&#8217;m asking you to account for the fact that this invoice shows that you have been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">paid for what would appear to be work in and around a person called Jowell who I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">believe to be Tessa Jowell who we&#8217;ve outlined in other documents. I believe that this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fact is because you may be taking part in the commission of the offence of unlawfully</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">intercepting her telecommunications &#8230;&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">than Mr Goodman, DC Green also put the following to him:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; I have no doubt, this simply goes back and there is evidence there that you have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been in the employee [sic] of News International for several years and you&#8217;ve been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">working with Mr Goodman most recently&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-75"><a href="#para2-75" name="para2-75">2.75</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 9 August 2006, following the interviews, Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire were charged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with conspiracy to intercept communications and eight substantive offences of unlawful</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interception of communications. Critical context for this development in the investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">comes from other arrests which took place on the same day as part of an investigation,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Overt. In short, 25 people were arrested for conspiracy to cause nine passenger</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aeroplanes to explode over the Atlantic; this was one of the largest counter terrorism</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operations ever undertaken.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref129" href="#footnote129">129</a></sup> When DCS Williams returned from leave on 12 August 2006,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he received a briefing during, which he stated, he would have been told about the range of</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">material that had been found<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref130" href="#footnote130">130</a></sup> but it is highly material to bear in mind that, from that time,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Overt was also occupying his attention.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref131" href="#footnote131">131</a></sup></span>

<h3>The initial review of the documents seized: compiling &#8220;The Blue Book&#8221;</h3>


<p id="para-id-2-76"><a href="#para2-76" name="para2-76">2.76</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The police have access to a computerised system to record the largest investigations and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the analysis of the material received. It is known as HOLMES (Home Office Large Major</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Enquiry System) but it was not used for this operation. In evidence, DCS Williams and DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Surtees gave different reasons for this decision. DCS Williams said that HOLMES was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">used because of the desire to keep the investigation secret. DCS Surtees said that it was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">possible to record all the documents on the database because it was already at operational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">capacity.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref132" href="#footnote132">132</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-77"><a href="#para2-77" name="para2-77">2.77</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In order to have the material analysed in more detail DCS Surtees had to negotiate for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary resources. Because his anti-terrorism colleagues were all working on Operation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Overt, DCS Surtees asked for some 20-30 officers from Special Branch:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref133" href="#footnote133">133</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> populate</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">spread sheet with the details of all those individuals who appear on the documents seized</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that there is an indication of Interception offences against them&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref134" href="#footnote134">134</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> They</span><span style="font-style:normal"> began</span><span style="font-style:normal"> work</span><span style="font-style:normal"> on</span><span style="font-style:normal"> 9</span></span>

<p id="para-id-2-78"><a href="#para2-78" name="para2-78">2.78</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In an entry in the decision log dated 10 August 2006, DCS Surtees gave a further indication</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of what the police were able to ascertain within days of seizing the documentation from Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire and which revealed his suspicions that Mr Mulcaire&#8217;s work was centred on obtaining</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">access to voicemail messages:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref136" href="#footnote136">136</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Having reviewed the material seized at the address searches it is clear that there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is a wealth of sensitive documents relating to hundreds of individuals including</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Royal Household, Members of Parliament, Sports stars, Military Police, Celebrities</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and journalists. There is also a number of electronic media seized including cassette</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">tapes, microtapes and computers ...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It is clear from the documents Recovered from the searches conducted that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire has been engaged in sustained (years) period of research on behalf of News</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">International, this assumption is based on the fact that News International have for a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">number of years paid substantial cash payments to his bank accounts. The documents</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are a collection of handwritten sheets that show &#8216;research&#8217; work in various levels of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">completion. In many there is simply a name of a celebrity or well known public figure</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">these develop into sheets detailing home addresses, business addresses, telephone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">numbers, DDNs, account numbers, passwords, pin numbers and scribblings of private</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information. Clearly from these documents I take the view that this research work</span>







<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is and has been undertaken over a substantial period and is with the intention of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">obtaining access to voicemail messages &#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-79"><a href="#para2-79" name="para2-79">2.79</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">With the identification and notification of potential victims in mind, DCS Surtees continued</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as follows in the decision log:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref137" href="#footnote137">137</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;To establish a full picture as to whether individuals have been intercepted or the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">amount of times they have been intercepted all of the airtime providers will need</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to search their database to give us those details. Once all of this work is complete</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">then I will discuss the issue of how we will notify those victims. Again whilst it would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be advantageous to victims to be informed I would not be in a position to provide</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">details and therefore would need to follow up each contact with further contact and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">conversations which by sheer volume would be impracticable. I am satisfied that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">risk to these victims has diminished due to the arrest of the two subjects &#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;From the documentary evidence referred to above a spread sheet has been produced</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">showing the names of everyone who is featured regardless of how developed the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">research appears. So in some cases the spread sheet will simply feature the name with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">no other information apparent in others then many other boxes will be populated.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Where we have a telephone number and a DDN I have asked for the telephone data</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to be cross referenced to ascertain whether possible interceptions have taken place.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">This will produce a possible &#8216;victim&#8217; list &#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-80"><a href="#para2-80" name="para2-80">2.80</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Before passing from this logged decision, it is important to note that DCS Surtees also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recorded that the present advice from the CPS was that there needed to be evidence that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail message was intercepted prior to being listened to by the intended recipient. Thus,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the advice of David Perry QC (that the wider interpretation of s1 of RIPA which avoided having</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to prove that &#8216;the envelope had not been opened&#8217; was arguably correct and that, in any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">event, the problems of interpretation could be wholly avoided by charging with conspiracy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to commit the RIPA offence) had simply not filtered down to DCS Surtees. He continued to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proceed on the basis of a far more restrictive interpretation of the law.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-81"><a href="#para2-81" name="para2-81">2.81</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The spreadsheet required by DCS Surtees took officers from Special Branch five to seven days</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(including overtime over a weekend) to create.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref138" href="#footnote138">138</a></sup> It became known as &#8220;the blue book&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref139" href="#footnote139">139</a></sup> and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DI Maberly explained that it was divided into two parts. The first part contained a list of &#8220;those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potentially compromised&#8221; and the second summarised the content of the audio and video</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exhibits.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref140" href="#footnote140">140</a></sup> The blue book also identified those who had potentially received the product of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Mulcaire&#8217;s work<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref141" href="#footnote141">141</a></sup> and was supplemented over the following weeks with various pieces of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information, including information supplied by the telephone companies.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref142" href="#footnote142">142</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-82"><a href="#para2-82" name="para2-82">2.82</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Surtees explained that where Mr Mulcaire had recorded the unique voicemail access</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">numberforaparticularvoicemailbox,therelevantmobilephonecompanywasaskedwhether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the number had been dialled by numbers which could be attributed to Clive Goodman or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Glenn Mulcaire, that is, &#8220;the suspect numbers&#8221;. The precise timing is not clear, but around</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the same time (and in line with the decision recorded on 10 August 2006), the police asked all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">five of the UK mobile phone service providers to identify calls by these suspect numbers, to</span>






<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">the voicemail boxes of any of their customers, dating back as far as possible.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref143" href="#footnote143">143</a></sup> To the suspect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">numbers was added a hub (or general) phone number at the NoTW which the police had also</span>

<h2>3. The prosecution strategy</h2>

<h3>Conference with counsel on 21 August 2006</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-1"><a href="#para3-1" name="para3-1">3.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 21 August 2006 a case conference took place at Counsels&#8217; Chambers involving leading</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and junior counsel, Ms Carmen Dowd on behalf of the CPS, and various police officers,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including DCS Williams. Mr Perry&#8217;s recollection is that, at that stage, he and Mr Mably did</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not have all the papers subsequently used at the Crown Court.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref146" href="#footnote146">146</a></sup> The Inquiry has seen notes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of this conference prepared by DCS Williams and also those of Mr Perry and Mr Mably.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref147" href="#footnote147">147</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In essence, the police officers explained to counsel that the review of the seized material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had demonstrated the existence of approximately 180 targets of interception<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref148" href="#footnote148">148</a></sup> although the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nature and quality of the evidence in relation to each had not been established. In order</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to ensure that the case remained manageable but also reflected the broad totality of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminality, counsel advised that the matter should proceed to trial on the basis of four to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">six victims (in addition to those from the Royal Household) who should be selected as being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">representative of the group as a whole. The advice given by counsel was that this number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of victims would afford the court adequate sentencing powers; it was important to provide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a picture of the criminality so that its scope could be reflected.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref149" href="#footnote149">149</a></sup> The inclusion of any more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">victims would not increase the sentencing powers of the court.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref150" href="#footnote150">150</a></sup> This is a perfectly sensible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and extremely common strategy. As DCS Surtees said descriptively, there is a point at which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an indictment saturates.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref151" href="#footnote151">151</a></sup></span>









<!--new page--><p id="para-id-3-2"><a href="#para3-2" name="para3-2">3.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further, on the hypothesis that there were other potential defendants who were encouraging</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the commission of the primary offences, counsel pursued the question of whether anyone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">else was involved. In a short note produced on 14 July 2009, nearly three years later, Mr Perry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Mr Mably recorded the following:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref152" href="#footnote152">152</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We did enquire of the police at the conference whether there was any evidence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the editor of the News of the World was involved in the Goodman-Mulcaire</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">offences. We were told that there was not (and we never saw such evidence). We</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">also enquired whether there was any evidence connecting Mulcaire to other News of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the World journalists. Again we were told that there was not (and we never saw any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">such evidence).&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-3"><a href="#para3-3" name="para3-3">3.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Notwithstanding the apparent certainty of counsels&#8217; recollection as expressed in their note,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the evidence given by Mr Perry was slightly less emphatic as regards the specificity of his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">questions:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref153" href="#footnote153">153</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I would like to say that I necessarily expressed it in precisely those terms,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but I was concerned to discover whether this went further than just the particular</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">individuals with which we were concerned and I think I was conscious in my own mind</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the question had to be whether it was journalists to the extent of the editor.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-4"><a href="#para3-4" name="para3-4">3.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Perry clarified during his evidence that his question was directed at ascertaining whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was evidence that would support charges against other individuals rather than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understanding simply what suspicions the police might have had. Having been asked whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was possible that there were speculative discussions along the lines that there might be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstantial or inferential evidence, as opposed to anything concrete, he said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref154" href="#footnote154">154</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly possible, although I have no recollection of it, and I think from my point</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of view I would have been looking to see whether there was a possibility of a case,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rather than whether there was something that was speculative &#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-5"><a href="#para3-5" name="para3-5">3.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Recognising that many cases are built on circumstantial or inferential evidence, Mr Perry</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref155" href="#footnote155">155</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Butitdependsonthecombination of circumstancesand thestrengthof anyevidence,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but certainly in the context of looking at the material that we had in this case and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the evidence available to us, I certainly don&#8217;t think I saw anything that would have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enabled me to present a case in any &#8211; on the basis of any inference or circumstantial</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">evidence.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-6"><a href="#para3-6" name="para3-6">3.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Perry also made it clear that he had not seen any evidence that other individuals had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been involved, but that he was basing his question on his own knowledge and experience of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists and newspapers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref156" href="#footnote156">156</a></sup> In answer to his direct question, Mr Perry said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref157" href="#footnote157">157</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We were informed that there was no such evidence. I can&#8217;t recall which officer gave</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that reply. I think, in fairness to everyone involved in the case, I think it&#8217;s right to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">say that this was still at a time when the information that we were obtaining was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">continuing to develop.&#8221;</span>






<!--new page--><p id="para-id-3-7"><a href="#para3-7" name="para3-7">3.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams does not dispute that counsel would have been told at the conference that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was no evidence that others at NoTW were involved in the conspiracy. When he gave</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence, DCS Williams said that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref158" href="#footnote158">158</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; we were all aware of what the speculations, potentially how this might be further</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">than these two men, because that was part of our discussion in terms of considering</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whether or not there may be other defendants. In terms of there actually being</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">evidence, and they had access to all the material, then I would agree: at that time,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">we didn&#8217;t have evidence.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-8"><a href="#para3-8" name="para3-8">3.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It seems overwhelmingly likely both that DCS Williams was the officer who answered Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Perry&#8217;s question (neither DCS Surtees nor DI Maberly were at the conference) and that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Perry&#8217;s recollection of the answer given was accurate. As to his note concerning &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> anyone</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether others were involved; it was this discussion that led onto the question of obtaining a</span>

<p id="para-id-3-9"><a href="#para3-9" name="para3-9">3.9</a></p>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams described his thinking as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref161" href="#footnote161">161</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;[Mr Mulcaire] has a contract for something like 104,000 a year. What&#8217;s he getting &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">why&#8217;s he got that? Who&#8217;s tasking him? What are they tasking him with? And equally,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what&#8217;s he giving back? Dependent on the outcome of that, we would be able to do</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">analysis in terms of, well, assessing, then, consider, actually, what is it that we might</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be able to do in terms of building a further case?&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">his recollection of the conference.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref162" href="#footnote162">162</a></sup> In it, he set out his belief that everyone recognised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that proving that someone was the victim of interception was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;extremely</span><span style="font-style:italic"> challenging&#8221;</span> (a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statement which, as Keir Starmer QC<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref163" href="#footnote163">163</a></sup> himself recognised, was consistent with the narrow</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view of the law).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref164" href="#footnote164">164</a></sup> DCS Williams further explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref165" href="#footnote165">165</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In relation to whether or not anyone else was involved. As a part of this same</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">conference and considering what we had discovered we actually commented that we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were open to the potential for there to be other defendants and in fact part of our</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">discussion was around the merits of getting a Production Order to see if it would reveal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more to help our understanding. Our NTFIU, MPS Legal services and Louis Mably</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were actioned to explore that further, particularly around what we could legitimately</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ask for in such an order, but the view of the meeting was that, that process may</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">well be &#8216;drawn out&#8217; by NOTW and that if possible we would seek disclosure through</span>








<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">written request to their legal department seeking cooperation with our investigation.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The latter is what happened &#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-11"><a href="#para3-11" name="para3-11">3.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Starmer declined to comment on this segment of DCS Williams&#8217; note.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref166" href="#footnote166">166</a></sup> Subsequently,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Mably stated that he<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;broadly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> agreed&#8221;</span> with it.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref167" href="#footnote167">167</a></sup> Mr Perry explained that there were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">two issues relating to the question of a production order: the first was whether there was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any basis for obtaining evidence generally by way of a production order, and the second was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether a production order should be sought to obtain evidence of payments made by Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Goodman to Mr Mulcaire.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref168" href="#footnote168">168</a></sup> Mr Perry emphasised that he did not think that the minds of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">anyone were closed at that stage<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref169" href="#footnote169">169</a></sup> and it is certainly accurate that, following the conference,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Mably did, in fact, draft an application for a production order.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref170" href="#footnote170">170</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-12"><a href="#para3-12" name="para3-12">3.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I do not believe that DCS Williams sought to downplay the number of victims, as has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggested, still less that he misled counsel in any respect. It is right that DCS Williams told</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">counsel that there was &#8220;no evidence&#8221; that journalists other than Mr Goodman were involved,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when in reality there was inferential and circumstantial evidence,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref171" href="#footnote171">171</a></sup> but this was in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context of the common understanding that counsel was enquiring into whether there was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficient evidence to charge any further suspects. DCS Williams did not hide from counsel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his suspicions that others were involved, on the contrary, they were openly discussed: he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sought advice from counsel on whether a production order could be obtained in order to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">secure evidence to substantiate those suspicions. DCS Williams was plainly open to pursuing</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigative avenues with a view to supporting the hypothesis that others were involved. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be unfair to suggest that, in some way, he was setting out to restrict the investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and avoid casting the net beyond Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-13"><a href="#para3-13" name="para3-13">3.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, no evidence was concealed. At the very least, counsel and the CPS knew of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence supporting the charges that became counts 16-20 and were aware of the corner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">names which could implicate other journalists (because of counts 16 to 20). Counsel were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given a copy of the blue book; further, albeit for the specific and limited purpose of reviewing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the unused material,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref172" href="#footnote172">172</a></sup> Mr Mably was given access to all the documents seized, including all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Mulcaire papers.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-14"><a href="#para3-14" name="para3-14">3.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is also clear from the notes of the conference that counsel gave some consideration to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">technical legal question which arose under RIPA namely whether it was necessary to prove</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the unlawful interceptions had taken place before the voicemail messages had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">listened to by their intended recipients. It is less clear, however, precisely what advice was</span>








<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">given, and with what emphasis. That said, Mr Perry gave clear evidence to the effect that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not advise that the narrow view of the law was correct. In short:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref173" href="#footnote173">173</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;well, I&#8217;m confident that that was not the approach that we took because it wouldn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be consistent with the terms of the indictment that was originally settled, and I think</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the view that Mr Mably and I took was that what Lord Woolf had said in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Ipswich Crown Court case<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref174" href="#footnote174">174</a></sup> certainly provided an arguable basis for someone to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contend that the narrow view was correct, but we thought that we should proceed on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the broader view, and if the point were taken against us, we could meet it in a number</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of ways, because it was about making sure that we didn&#8217;t lose the case overall, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we could meet it in a number of ways &#8230; [a]nd in any event, the conspiracy charge</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could outflank any such argument&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-15"><a href="#para3-15" name="para3-15">3.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">So it came about that, in due course, counts 16 to 20 of the indictment, which alleged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">substantive offences under RIPA solely against Mr Mulcaire, were drafted by counsel. As Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Perry explained in evidence, he could not possibly have taken the narrow interpretation of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the law to be correct since, in relation to counts 16 to 20 there was neither evidence nor basis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for saying that the message had been listened to by an interceptor before it had been heard</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the intended recipient.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref175" href="#footnote175">175</a></sup> Further, Mr Perry did not advise the police to obtain &#8220;Vampire&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">data in relation to counts 16 to 20. Put simply, Mr Perry is correct. It is simply inconceivable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he (or any counsel instructed by the Crown to prosecute allegations of crime) would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have prepared an indictment on the premise of a legal interpretation which they knew to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">incorrect. I have no doubt that Mr Perry gave the advice in the terms summarised by him in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his evidence.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-16"><a href="#para3-16" name="para3-16">3.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whether DCS Williams took away this message from this conference is less clear. In his witness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statement for the purposes of the judicial review, DCS Williams said that counsel advised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that counts 16 to 20 should be included in order to test the law.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref176" href="#footnote176">176</a></sup> It is apparent, however,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as will be seen from the various notes, briefings and memoranda that he produced in 2009</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, at that stage at least, he was under the impression that counsel had been advising that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the narrow interpretation of the law was correct. It is a safe assumption that DCS Williams</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">misunderstood, or misremembered, what counsel had advised in August 2006; it would not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be safe or correct to conclude that DCS Williams deliberately mis-stated counsels&#8217; advice on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these subsequent occasions.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-17"><a href="#para3-17" name="para3-17">3.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Regardless of the extent to which both Mr Perry advised clearly and the advice was properly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understood, following this conference, the police made no attempt to obtain technical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence in relation to what became counts 16 to 20 which would have enabled the case</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be proved on the narrow view of the law. Nor is there any contemporaneous evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to show that counsels&#8217; advice caused surprise or consternation in the police camp. From</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that point therefore, the advice previously given by the CPS had no bearing upon the way</span>





<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">the prosecution was prepared and advanced.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref177" href="#footnote177">177</a></sup> It is also worth adding that, at the same</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conference, counsel advised that the appropriate charges should be under RIPA; offences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under the CMA (which had no technical problems) were not pursued so as to ensure a simpler</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">presentation to a jury.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref178" href="#footnote178">178</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-18"><a href="#para3-18" name="para3-18">3.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thelasttopicdiscussedwasthequestionofconfiscationpursuanttos6oftheProceedsofCrime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Act 2002. Without setting out the detail of the relevant statutory provisions, a confiscation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">order, in essence, requires a convicted defendant to pay a sum of money representing the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">level of his or her financial benefit from his or her criminal conduct. The police wished to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contend for a substantial benefit figure based on the monthly retainer on the basis that it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">part and parcel of Mr Mulcaire&#8217;s criminal enterprise.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref179" href="#footnote179">179</a></sup> However, given NI&#8217;s claim, through</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Burton Copeland, that the monthly retainer paid to Mr Mulcaire did not relate to the matters</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that were the subject of charges,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref180" href="#footnote180">180</a></sup> Mr Perry advised that the confiscation proceedings</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should focus on the cash payments, which amounted to &#163;12,300.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref181" href="#footnote181">181</a></sup> Mr Perry explained that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the short point was that if Mr Mulcaire was doing legitimate work it was difficult to argue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it was as a result of or in connection with the offending. Mr Perry agreed that it was his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision that this was the appropriate approach to take.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref182" href="#footnote182">182</a></sup> It is convenient to state here that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ultimately the Crown Court made a confiscation order for &#163;12,300.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-19"><a href="#para3-19" name="para3-19">3.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Before passing from the information placed before Mr Perry and the advice that he gave, it</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">is appropriate to refer to the &#8220;for Neville&#8221; email. When giving evidence, Mr Perry was asked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether or not he saw this email at this conference or at any stage before 26 January 2007</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(when Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire were sentenced). Mr Perry said in evidence that he did</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not have any recollection of seeing it,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref183" href="#footnote183">183</a></sup> and he did not shift his ground when shown a note</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a much later conference on 1 October 2010 which suggested that he saw this email after</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the case papers relating to Mr Gordon Taylor had been prepared for trial.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref184" href="#footnote184">184</a></sup> It is right that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the email formed part of the unused material but Mr Perry was not asked to examine that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material and would not have been expected to do so absent specific instruction. Although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it may not advance the issue very far, I conclude that Mr Perry probably did not see the &#8220;for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Neville&#8221; email earlier than his recollection.</span>
<h3>Victims not associated with the Royal Household</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-20"><a href="#para3-20" name="para3-20">3.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Following the conference, the investigating officers set about contacting victims to ascertain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether they would be willing to provide evidence in support of the prosecution.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref185" href="#footnote185">185</a></sup> DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Surtees gave evidence that one of these victims was Tessa Jowell and, furthermore, that she</span>









<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">declined to assist.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref186" href="#footnote186">186</a></sup> Ms Jowell strongly disputed that she was unwilling to assist with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecution. She provided her account in these terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref187" href="#footnote187">187</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I remember very clearly the conversation, which, as I say, took place on holiday. I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">happened to be by the swimming pool with very close friends that I was on holiday</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with. The conversation didn&#8217;t take very long, but I am absolutely clear that I sought</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">clarification about what further I should do, expressed my willingness to help in any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">way that I could but was assured that at that stage there was nothing further that I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">needed to do.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; I would also say that I was a secretary of state and a privy councillor. It would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have been absolutely incumbent on me, were I asked to co-operate with an inquiry,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to agree to. My principal private secretary, who is a civil servant, confirmed my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">willingness to help, as too the two friends that I was on &#8211; who I recounted this too,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are also abundantly clear about the account of the conversation that I gave them.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; I was telephoned again by the police to be told that a prosecution was going to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">brought against Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire. I asked if I needed to provide a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">statement or further assistance. I can&#8217;t remember the precise word that I used, but it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was essentially an offer of any assistance with the inquiry, and was told very clearly</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that I wouldn&#8217;t be needed as a witness because they had witnesses from the royal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">household who would support the prosecution.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-21"><a href="#para3-21" name="para3-21">3.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is not an issue that is directly relevant to my Terms of Reference but I find the evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given by Ms Jowell on this point to be compelling. It is not necessary to decide how DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Surtees came to recall otherwise save that I do not conclude that he was deliberately seeking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to minimise the impact on NI: had he wished to do that, he would not have spoken to her in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the first place.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the meantime, in response to the request to identify any customers whose voicemail boxes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been called by the suspect numbers, Vodafone emailed DI Maberly, on 29 August 2006,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with a spreadsheet of calls made to 61 unique voicemail access numbers by Mr Goodman&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">home landline and Mr Mulcaire&#8217;s office landline. A large number of those on the list were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">celebrities and well-known public figures, whilst others appeared to be company names.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref188" href="#footnote188">188</a></sup> On</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">30 August 2006 DI Maberly emailed Orange to ask if there was &#8220;an indication of interception&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the voicemail messages of six named individuals, including Simon Hughes. He also sent an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">email to Vodafone asking if anyone had listened to the voicemail of nine named people.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref189" href="#footnote189">189</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 10 October 2006, O2 responded to the request to identify customers whose voicemail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">boxes had been called by the suspect numbers by sending DI Maberly a spreadsheet setting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out the number of times that the 93 customers concerned had been called by the suspect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">numbers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref190" href="#footnote190">190</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-23"><a href="#para3-23" name="para3-23">3.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the light of the information that became available, an appropriate number of victims</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(additional to those emanating from the Royal Household) were identified as the named</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">victims for the charges that were represented by counts 16 to 20 of the indictment directed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at Glenn Mulcaire (and not part of the conspiracy count which involved Clive Goodman).</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">They were chosen, essentially, because of the high volume of frequency of calls (along with</span>





<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">their duration) to the unique voicemail access numbers by Mr Mulcaire.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref191" href="#footnote191">191</a></sup> The subjects of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these five charges were Max Clifford, Skylet Andrew, Graham Taylor, Simon Hughes and Elle</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Macpherson.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-24"><a href="#para3-24" name="para3-24">3.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the light of all the circumstances, it is necessary to deal with one further discussion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with a potential victim of multiple interceptions. DCS Williams gave evidence that, in early</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">September 2006, the police contacted Rebekah Brooks (then editor of The Sun) to notify</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">her that she was a potential victim of voicemail interception and to ascertain whether she</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wanted to make a formal complaint in that capacity.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref192" href="#footnote192">192</a></sup> An email, dated 15 September 2006,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sent by Andy Coulson to Tom Crone after this meeting, which set out what Mrs Brooks had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been told<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;by</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> cops&#8221;</span> , has generated a number of concerns.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref193" href="#footnote193">193</a></sup> On the face of the email, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appeared that the police had given Mrs Brooks details of the prosecution strategy over and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">above that which any other victim of crime could expect to be given and it is suggested that,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in so doing, the police were improperly alerting her to the state of the investigation by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MPS, inviting her to take action internally. Further, the last sentence of the email (<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;They</span><span style="font-style:italic"> are</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">going to contact RW today to see if she wishes to take it further&#8221;)<span style="font-style:normal"> could</span><span style="font-style:normal"> be</span><span style="font-style:normal"> interpreted</span><span style="font-style:normal"> as</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meaning that the police were asking her whether she wanted the police to take further the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation into others within NI.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref194" href="#footnote194">194</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-25"><a href="#para3-25" name="para3-25">3.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Again, I can well understand how this second hand summary of the conversation, reduced</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">into an email, can give the impression of collusion but, having heard DCS Williams&#8217; evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on this issue, I am satisfied that Mrs Brooks was contacted by the police because she, too, had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been a victim of extensive voicemail interception (with her voicemails having been accessed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">up to twice a week). I also accept that information was passed to Mrs Brooks not as a result</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of an improper relationship with the police but with a view to her making a formal complaint</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and consenting to being part of the prosecution.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref195" href="#footnote195">195</a></sup> This is the context in which one must view</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the final line of the email. As DCS Williams said: &#8220;This is purely: you are a potential victim.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Would you like to join our prosecution?&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref196" href="#footnote196">196</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-26"><a href="#para3-26" name="para3-26">3.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The same email also referred to Mr Mulcaire receiving payments totalling over &#163;1 million.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In evidence, DCS Williams said that the figure of &#163;1 million was not known to him or his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation team.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref197" href="#footnote197">197</a></sup> Since the &#163;1 million figure is not supported by evidence available</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contemporaneously or subsequently it is simply not clear where this figure came from. Again,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the present investigation and prosecution precludes any further investigation of this issue.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-27"><a href="#para3-27" name="para3-27">3.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Fitting within the general chronology, it is relevant to note two engagements between NI</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and senior officers of the MPS. The first was on 19 September 2006 when Lord Blair, with Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Fedorcio, met Andy Coulson. Whilst there could well be a concern that this meeting provided</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the opportunity for the exercise of inappropriate influence over the police investigation (and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perhaps rather more thought should have been given to the perception that could result</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the meeting), there is not the slightest evidence that this was a reality. As I have set</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out above, Lord Blair played no part in the decision-making process; his involvement did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">go beyond receiving limited briefings from Mr Hayman and Mr Clarke. The second was on</span>







<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">26 October 2006 and consisted of a two hour, early evening, meeting between Mr Hayman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Neil Wallis. The problem of perception (and the question of the extent to which that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perception was considered) recurs. Again, there is no evidential basis for concluding that this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meeting impacted in any way on the police investigation.</span>

<h3>The approach of Burton Copeland</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-28"><a href="#para3-28" name="para3-28">3.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In order to obtain relevant evidence from NI, the CPS advised the police to enter into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">correspondence with them (though Burton Copeland). This was because the legislative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provisions for obtaining a production order, which would require NI to produce journalistic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material to the police or provide the police with access to it required other methods to have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been tried without success or that it be established that such methods were bound to fail.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref198" href="#footnote198">198</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thus, a court would be unlikely to make a production order, requiring a person or organisation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to hand over such journalistic material, if it were satisfied that the person or organisation in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">possession of the material appeared to be cooperating with the police.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-29"><a href="#para3-29" name="para3-29">3.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the light of the fact that NI had instructed Burton Copeland to respond to police requests,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the officers sought their cooperation and assistance, through Burton Copeland, in relation to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">a number of evidential matters.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-30"><a href="#para3-30" name="para3-30">3.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The investigators were keen to identify who would have used the hub phone at the NoTW</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that had been used hundreds of times to call the voicemail boxes of individuals not associated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the Royal Household.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref199" href="#footnote199">199</a></sup> DI Maberly approached Vodafone who told him that he would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have to get that information from the NoTW.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref200" href="#footnote200">200</a></sup> Mr Bristowe (the prosecution&#8217;s telephone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expert) advised DI Maberly that no large firm would have unaccounted for billing, because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it would want to monitor the use of the phone systems by staff, to detect any abuses. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police therefore had an expectation that NI would be able to identify the user of the hub</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">phone in question.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref201" href="#footnote201">201</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-31"><a href="#para3-31" name="para3-31">3.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Surtees tasked DI Maberly with writing to the NoTW for the purposes of ascertaining</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who would have used the hub phone and obtaining further evidence against Mr Mulcaire and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Goodman, but also to gather evidence of the involvement of other journalists or editorial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">staff in the conspiracy with Mr Mulcaire.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref202" href="#footnote202">202</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-32"><a href="#para3-32" name="para3-32">3.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 31 August 2006 DI Maberly attended Burton Copeland&#8217;s offices and made a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requests for information.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref203" href="#footnote203">203</a></sup> That same day Burton Copeland wrote a letter to the police,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apparently stating an intention to cooperate fully with all their reasonable requests for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref204" href="#footnote204">204</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;On behalf of my clients, Newsgroup Newspapers Ltd, I would wish to make it plain</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that in connection with the enquiries that you are presently conducting and which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are referred to in the Application under the Schedule 1 of the Police and Criminal</span>

<p id="para-id-3-33"><a href="#para3-33" name="para3-33">3.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In that letter Burton Copeland referred to the &#8220;PACE application&#8221; (the application for a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">production order drafted by Mr Mably) and the fact that the police sought:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;all paid cheques, credit/debit slips, mandates, statements of accounts, inter-account</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and telegraphic transfers, any other vouchers in relation to the following financial</span>

<p id="para-id-3-35"><a href="#para3-35" name="para3-35">3.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DI Maberly stated in the letter that:</span>





<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The investigation is attempting to identify all persons that may be involved including</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any fellow conspirators. Therefore we require the telephone numbers of persons</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">called before and after relevant unlawful calls to the voice mailboxes.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-3-36"><a href="#para3-36" name="para3-36">3.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 15 September 2006 DI Maberly hand delivered a further letter to Burton Copeland which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">included the following:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref210" href="#footnote210">210</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;During the search of Mr Goodman&#8217;s offices at News International he identified the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">computer used by him (situated on his desk) and a safe also used by him (situated</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">under his desk). These items were not seized or searched but were subject to a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">retention request. In relation to these two items I would like to be provided with a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">copy of information held on computer (including any mainframe database accessed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from the desktop computer) and any information held in the safe that relates to the</span>

<p id="para-id-3-37"><a href="#para3-37" name="para3-37">3.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Burton Copeland had drafted a letter dated 14 September 2006, which they gave to DI</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Maberly when he visited their premises on 15 September 2006. It stated the following:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref211" href="#footnote211">211</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Newsgroup Newspapers are anxious to provide all material reasonably required</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in respect of your investigation into voicemail interception offences. We stress,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">however, that the procedure under Part 2 of the 1984 Act is a procedure designed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to produce documentation or other material in the possession of an individual. It is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not a procedure designed to elicit answers other than those contained within such</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">material.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In fact, very little documentary or other material in relation to Mr Mulcaire, Nine</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Consultancy Ltd or Mr Goodman exists. This is entirely consistent with normal business</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">practices in relation to the use of such consultants.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Attached to this letter are copies of all documents held by Newsgroup Newspapers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">falling within the terms of your request. This comprises copy documentation relating</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the contract of employment between Nine Consultancy Ltd and NOTW. Extensive</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">searches have revealed the existence of only one piece of paper, enclosed herewith.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;No documents exist recording any work completed by Mr Mulcaire, monitoring of Mr</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire&#8217;s return of work, reporting structures or any persons for whom Mr Mulcaire</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">may have provided information. There is no floor plan. The telephone system installed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at Newsgroup Newspapers does not provide an itemised breakdown in respect of any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">particular extension number&#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Newsgroup Newspapers wishes fully to assist your investigation and does not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">require any formal Court Order for the provision of any material. They are, however,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">entirely satisfied that the material to which you are entitled is limited and that you</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">by NI generally. In my judgment this is an artificial and inapt distinction: by way of example,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there must have been an internal telephone directory for the NoTW and documentation that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could have led the police (perhaps through the telephone network if the records were not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">kept) to trace which extensions were dialling which numbers. DCS Williams, DCS Surtees and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DI Maberly all formed the impression that whilst Burton Copeland were protesting that they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were cooperating, the reality was the opposite.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref212" href="#footnote212">212</a></sup> In evidence DI Maberly agreed that he was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">very suspicious that he was being &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> fobbed</span><span style="font-style:italic"> off</span> &#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref213" href="#footnote213">213</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-39"><a href="#para3-39" name="para3-39">3.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">After 15 September 2006, no further documents were produced by Burton Copeland.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ultimately therefore, NI provided the MPS with extremely scant information. The MPS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">describes this, correctly in my judgment, as a &#8220;veneer of cooperation&#8221;. Despite their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">protestations to the contrary, NI were not helping the police with their enquiries.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-40"><a href="#para3-40" name="para3-40">3.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is relevant that once NI decided, in January 2011, fully to co-operate with the MPS, that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is exactly what happened and the investigations that have become Operations Weeting,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Elveden and Tuleta (with subsidiary operations associated with them) has been the result.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">While signalling the intention of NI now to place itself in the position of demonstrating that it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">takes compliance with the criminal law extremely seriously, it undeniably casts light on what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had happened previously. I am not in a position to judge what part, if any, Burton Copeland</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">played in the approach to the police investigation in 2006, what their instructions were or the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advice they gave because NI has not waived the legal professional privilege which attaches</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to this material. As a result, the public can only know what Burton Copeland did and not why</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they did it.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-41"><a href="#para3-41" name="para3-41">3.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s evidence was that when Mr Goodman was arrested he was told, probably</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by Les Hinton, then the Executive Chairman of NI, that NI was co-operating with the police.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref214" href="#footnote214">214</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In support of the contention that NI was cooperating, Rupert Murdoch referred to appointing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;a special law firm to look into this and to aid our co-operation with the police&#8230;&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref215" href="#footnote215">215</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> When</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was told, during his evidence, that the Inquiry had heard evidence that the solicitors&#8217; firm</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerned provided limited documentation<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref216" href="#footnote216">216</a></sup> that did not represent the position at all and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, one way or another, NI was being obstructive Rupert Murdoch said:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;That</span><span style="font-style:italic"> shocks</span><span style="font-style:italic"> me</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deeply, and I was unaware of it and I&#8217;ve not heard of it until you&#8217;ve just said that.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref217" href="#footnote217">217</a></sup></span>






<!--new page--><p id="para-id-3-42"><a href="#para3-42" name="para3-42">3.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This raises two issues about local management at NI, its internal governance and its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship with News Corporation. First, if Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s evidence is correct, it appears</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there was a lack of full transparency between the local management at NI and senior</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">management at News Corporation or, alternatively, a very different understanding of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meaning of the word co-operation. Second the approach taken by NI is far from what might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be expected of a well-run corporation. Mr Clarke described a closing of ranks by NI and said</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;unusual</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> major</span><span style="font-style:italic"> company</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8211;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> where</span><span style="font-style:italic"> full</span><span style="font-style:italic"> co-operation</span><span style="font-style:italic"> would</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> norm&#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref218" href="#footnote218">218</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An organisational culture that is founded on integrity and honesty would require not only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">full co-operation with law enforcement, but also a determination to expose behaviour that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">failed to comply with the law. That would normally be achieved through a thorough internal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation of any allegation, unaffected by the legal constraints that the police might face,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in order to ensure that any wrongdoing in the company was uncovered, stopped and dealt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with appropriately. What happened at the NoTW in relation to voicemail interception in this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context is particularly informative about the culture that pertained both within the corporate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and editorial operations.</span>

<h3>The report of the High Tech Crime Unit</h3>

<p id="para-id-3-43"><a href="#para3-43" name="para3-43">3.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 23 November 2006, pursuant to a task set by DCS Surtees, the High Tech Crime Unit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Directorate of Professional Standards at the MPS produced a report<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref219" href="#footnote219">219</a></sup> setting out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the results of the examination of the computers and other storage media seized during the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">August searches.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref220" href="#footnote220">220</a></sup> The examination revealed a computerised record of approximately 300</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">names, addresses, dates of birth, mobile phone numbers and additional information. Many</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the names have been redacted to protect the privacy of the individuals concerned, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the unredacted names include: Maria, Charlotte and James Church; Max Clifford; Ashley</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Cole; Stephen J. Coogan; Cornelia Crisan; George Galloway; Ryan Giggs; James Hewitt; Ulrika</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Jonsson; Jude Law; Sadie Frost; Elle McPherson; Mark Oaten and Brian Paddick.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-44"><a href="#para3-44" name="para3-44">3.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The investigating officers were concerned to discover that within the report were the details</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of people who had been given new identities as part of the witness protection programme.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref221" href="#footnote221">221</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The extreme sensitivity of this information does not require elaboration. Equally seriously, at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the least, it gave rise to the possibility that police officers had been providing information to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Mulcaire. Mr Mulcaire was not asked about this in interview and Mr Clarke was not made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">aware of it.</span>

<p id="para-id-3-45"><a href="#para3-45" name="para3-45">3.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Surtees instructed DI Maberly to contact the witness protection unit, provide them with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the list of names and ask them to take whatever action they considered necessary.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref222" href="#footnote222">222</a></sup> When DI</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">the appropriate remedial action.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref224" href="#footnote224">224</a></sup> Mr Clarke agreed that this was the correct way of dealing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the matter.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref225" href="#footnote225">225</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-3-46"><a href="#para3-46" name="para3-46">3.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The report of the High Tech Crime Unit included the following statement:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;It</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> also</span><span style="font-style:italic"> believed</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">act on this adds to the impression that there were areas of investigation which were highly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sensitive and which made the MPS unwilling to probe further. Although I understand the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern, it would not be appropriate for me to go further. Suffice to say, the current criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation continues and my determination not to prejudice that investigation has meant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that further detail has not been explored in the evidence. The points that I have made about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the individual officers responsible for the conduct of Operation Caryatid are not affected and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remain, even if there was some additional thread which could have been followed.</span>

<h2>4. The outcome to the prosecution</h2>

<h3>The criminal proceedings</h3>

<p id="para-id-4-1"><a href="#para4-1" name="para4-1">4.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The indictment brought against Mr Mulcaire and Mr Goodman contained the following 16</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">counts:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Count 1: Against both, conspiracy to intercept communications contrary to s1(1) of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Criminal Law Act 1977;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Counts 2, 3, 7, 10 and 13: Against both, interception of the voicemail messages of Helen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Asprey contrary to s1(1) of RIPA;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Counts 4, 6, 8, 11 and 14: Against both, interception of the voicemail messages of Jamie</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lowther-Pinkerton contrary to s1(1) of RIPA;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Counts 5, 9, 12 and 15: Against both, interception of the voicemail messages of Paddy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Haverson contrary to s1(1) of RIPA;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Counts 16-20: Against Mr Mulcaire only, interception of the voicemail messages of Max</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Clifford, Skylet Andrew, Graham Taylor, Simon Hughes and Elle Macpherson respectively</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contrary to s1(1) of RIPA.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-2"><a href="#para4-2" name="para4-2">4.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Perry explained that counts 2 to 15 were substantive allegations intended as an alternative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to count 1 which charged the underlying criminal conspiracy; in relation to all the substantive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">counts, there was not necessarily the evidence available to prove that the voicemails had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">listened to before their intended recipients.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref226" href="#footnote226">226</a></sup> Counts 16 to 20 were individual substantive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">charges intended to reflect the further criminality.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-3"><a href="#para4-3" name="para4-3">4.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 29 November 2006, at the Plea and Case Management hearing conducted at the Central</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Criminal Court, Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire pleaded guilty to the main counts on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">indictment.Althoughitmightbelegitimatetoconcludethatthelawyersactingforthemenhad</span>



<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">no confidence in the possible success of any argument relating to the correct interpretation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of s1 of RIPA, the fact is that it was simply never tested. On 26 January 2007, Mr Justice Gross</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sentenced Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire to four and six months&#8217; imprisonment respectively.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-4"><a href="#para4-4" name="para4-4">4.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At the sentencing hearing, during the course of his plea in mitigation, counsel for Mr Mulcaire</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">asserted that his client was working for others at NI in relation to the interceptions which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">formed the basis of counts 16 to 20. He said, in terms:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;This</span><span style="font-style:italic"> information</span><span style="font-style:italic"> would</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> been</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">passed on not to Mr Goodman &#8211; I stress the point &#8211; but to the same organisation&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref227" href="#footnote227">227</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-4-5"><a href="#para4-5" name="para4-5">4.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although this has been a matter of some debate, the point has already been made that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Goodman had no specific interest (perhaps with some limited exceptions) in the non-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Royal material, and it is clear that the evidential links between the two men which had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">present for the Royal interceptions were not available for the others. Yet, Mr Mulcaire must</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been working for someone. Mr Justice Gross picked up on this submission in his own</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sentencing remarks. He said:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;As</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Counts</span><span style="font-style:italic"> 16-20,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> you</span><span style="font-style:italic"> had</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> dealt</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Goodman</span><span style="font-style:italic"> but</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although Mr Perry rightly pointed out that the judge did not reach this conclusion as a result</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of any submission he had made during the course of opening the case that morning, he readily</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">accepted that the judge was not simply relying on the submissions of Mr Mulcaire&#8217;s counsel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but also on<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> bit</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> common</span><span style="font-style:italic"> sense</span><span style="font-style:italic"> added</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref229" href="#footnote229">229</a></sup> It is right to observe that Mr Perry added in</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Mulcaire and it is difficult to postulate that Mr Mulcaire was simply offering information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">without being encouraged or prompted.</span>

<p id="para-id-4-7"><a href="#para4-7" name="para4-7">4.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Justice Gross also referred in his sentencing remarks to the fact that Mr Goodman had</span>

<h2>5. Subsequent operational decisions</h2>

<p id="para-id-5-1"><a href="#para5-1" name="para5-1">5.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">One of the most serious allegations against the police relates to the deliberate decision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effectively to shut down Operation Caryatid when it is argued that there was clearly much</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more that could have been uncovered. It is suggested that the decision not to pursue further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigations could have been affected by the relationship between the officers of the MPS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and NI or, in other words, had not been taken in good faith or for good operational reasons.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Similar concerns (examined in the next section) deal with the strategy adopted to deal with</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the circumstances, it has been necessary to investigate in detail the circumstances in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which the police reached the decision not to take Operation Caryatid further. This involves</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an understanding of the police operational background at the time of the investigation, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an analysis of the evidential issues concerning the police along the possible next steps that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could have been taken.</span>
<h3>The background</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-3"><a href="#para5-3" name="para5-3">5.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Police resources are finite and the decision not to widen the Operation Caryatid investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cannot properly be understood without a full understanding of the operational context at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">time. More specifically, for what had been SO13, whose primary commitment was to counter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terrorism, the issue was the scale and immediacy of the threat from terrorism at the time and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the massive pressure on resources that it entailed. It is of such importance that it is worth</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">quoting extensively from the statement made by Mr Clarke:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref232" href="#footnote232">232</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;72&#8230; Throughout much of 2002 and running into 2003 an operation called</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Springbourne taught us that there was a real and immediate threat within the UK</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from Islamist terrorists &#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;73. During 2003-2004 there was an accelerating tempo of terrorist investigations &#8230;</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There were many other strands of intelligence that showed the threat to the UK from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Islamist terrorism was not only a reality, but growing in intensity.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;74. In 2004, there was a major escalation in our understanding of the scale and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nature of terrorist plotting in the UK with the discovery, early in the year that a group</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of British citizens were planning to make and detonate a large bomb. This required</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what was then the largest ever UK surveillance operation to control the threat posed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">by the plotters and to gather evidence to convict them. This operation was called</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Operation Crevice &#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;75. Later in 2004, there was another major investigation called Operation Rhyme</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which dismantled a terrorist network led by a veteran jihadist called Dhiren Barot,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whose ambition was to mount attacks, including the use of radiological devices, both</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the US and the UK. Both of these cases led to multi-defendant prosecutions which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in all took over three years to come to a conclusion, and devoured huge amounts of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigative resource throughout that time.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;76. These cases and others showed a clear intention on the part of terrorists to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">attack the UK mainland to try to kill as many people as possible whenever possible &#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;78.InJuly2005,despitethebesteffortsoftheUKcounterterroristcommunity,London</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was twice attacked to devastating effect. The subsequent criminal investigation was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the largest ever carried out in the UK, drawing in detective resources from across</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the country, and in effect lasted right through until the Inquest into the deaths of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">victims of the 7/7 attacks was concluded in 2011.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;79. By early 2006, at exactly the time Operation Caryatid was developing, Operation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Overt began. This was the next in line of what seemed like an interminable series</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of potentially devastating plots. This one turned out to be a plan to blow up,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">simultaneously, a number of transatlantic airliners en route from the UK to the USA</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8230; As with other major terrorist cases, the prosecutions in Operation Overt took a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">long time to come to fruition. In fact they took some 4 years and were spread over 7</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">separate trials. This all needed a massive commitment of officers from the Counter</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Terrorism Command (SO15).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;80. The impact of this was that those of us who were charged with protecting the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">public from the effects of terrorism were more than fully committed on matters</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that directly affected the safety of the British public. Not only were we continually</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8216;borrowing&#8217; colleagues from other parts of the MPS, we also drafted in large numbers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of officers from across the country. The impact of this on other policing operations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was at times severe. For instance, during the surveillance operation in support of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Operation Crevice in early 2004, every available surveillance team from within the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">MPS and indeed beyond was used on the enquiry. Investigations into drug trafficking,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">murder and other serious crime, including internal corruption enquiries, came second</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the need to protect the public from terrorism.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;81. Despiteall the support that was received throughout these years, and particularly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">after the attacks on London in 2005, by the time Goodman and Mulcaire were arrested</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in August 2006 the Anti-Terrorist Branch (SO13) had some 70 live terrorist cases on its</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">books, but insufficient resources to investigate them all. There was prioritisation even</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with life threatening terrorist cases, and that is the context within which the decisions</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that were taken to investigate possible invasions of privacy under Operation Caryatid</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">must be considered.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-4"><a href="#para5-4" name="para5-4">5.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Elaborating on this statement, it is clear that, since 2004, there had been repeated attempts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by Al-Qaeda networks to commit mass casualty suicide attacks. These included the fertiliser</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bomb plot (Operation Crevice) and Dhiren Barot and the dirty bomb plots (Operation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rhyme).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref233" href="#footnote233">233</a></sup> On 7 July and 21 July 2005, there was a series of coordinated suicide terrorist</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attacks and follow up attacks. Operation Crevice alone used every single surveillance team in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">London and most of those from the areas around London and Mr Clarke had &#8220;borrowed&#8221; over</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1,000 officers from other forces to support the investigation into the attacks on 7 July 2005.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By January 2007, 200 highly experienced and specialised officers continued to be on loan for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this work.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref234" href="#footnote234">234</a></sup> Mr Hayman described in evidence the terrorist threat as<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;unprecedented&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref235" href="#footnote235">235</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-5"><a href="#para5-5" name="para5-5">5.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Reid, endorsed the evidence of the police, saying that the scale of the terrorist threat and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ensuing counter-terrorist operations had been<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;well</span><span style="font-style:italic"> set</span><span style="font-style:italic"> out</span><span style="font-style:italic"> by</span><span style="font-style:italic"> others</span><span style="font-style:italic"> who</span><span style="font-style:italic"> had</span><span style="font-style:italic"> testified&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref236" href="#footnote236">236</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He explained that the threat level of a terrorist attack during 2006 varied only from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">second highest level, &#8220;Severe&#8221;, to the highest, &#8220;Critical&#8221;, where an attack was deemed likely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and imminent. He said the great fear of a terrorist attack at that time was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;superseding</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">everything else&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref237" href="#footnote237">237</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-6"><a href="#para5-6" name="para5-6">5.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This background is critical to an understanding of the operational context in which Mr Clarke</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had to consider whether and, if so, to what extent the investigation should continue beyond</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the very targeted prosecution of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire. Resources, however, were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not the only problem.</span>





<!--new page--><h3>The evidential issues</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-7"><a href="#para5-7" name="para5-7">5.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By mid-September 2006, the police had tried, without success, to obtain evidence from NI</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to support their strong suspicion that NoTW staff (other than Mr Goodman) were involved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in a conspiracy to intercept voicemail messages. The investigators, including DCS Williams,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref238" href="#footnote238">238</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not dispute, however, that they had material that implicated other journalists and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigative leads that could have been followed. The following is a stock-take of the matters</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the investigators had specifically identified by that time.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-8"><a href="#para5-8" name="para5-8">5.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The 11,000 pages of documents seized from Mr Mulcaire, taken together with the pattern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of behaviour demonstrated by the call data obtained, created a picture of a trade craft, of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">someone who was building up the means unlawfully to access voicemail messages (and that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in some cases he had utilised those means).</span>

<p id="para-id-5-9"><a href="#para5-9" name="para5-9">5.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was an inference that the &#8220;corner names&#8221; (so described because they were written</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the corner of Mr Mulcaire&#8217;s notes) were those who had either instructed Mr Mulcaire or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those who were the intended recipients of the information, or both. Not only did &#8220;Clive&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appear as a corner name in relation to the Royal Household voicemail message interceptions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but there were corner names associated with counts 16 to 20 on the indictment.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-10"><a href="#para5-10" name="para5-10">5.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The hub phone at the NoTW had been used hundreds of times to call the voicemail boxes of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals not related to the Royal Household.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref239" href="#footnote239">239</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-11"><a href="#para5-11" name="para5-11">5.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The phone records of Mr Mulcaire taken together with his papers (in which he had recorded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the mobile phone numbers of other journalists) demonstrated that Mr Mulcaire had made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">calls to journalists other than Mr Goodman.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref240" href="#footnote240">240</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-12"><a href="#para5-12" name="para5-12">5.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The lack of cooperation on the part of NI with the investigation (both by interfering with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">search of the Wapping offices and in their response, through Burton Copeland, to requests</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for documents and information which might implicate others at NI) bolstered the belief that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the criminality permeated wider within NI than just Mr Goodman.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-13"><a href="#para5-13" name="para5-13">5.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There were financial and editorial evidential leads available to the police relating to published</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">articles and payments for them.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-14"><a href="#para5-14" name="para5-14">5.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams was correct to assert that in order to prosecute any of the individuals referred</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to by the corner names he would have needed to be in a position to prove cogently who they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref241" href="#footnote241">241</a></sup> and that they had requested or received the information in the knowledge that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire obtained information through voicemail interception.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref242" href="#footnote242">242</a></sup> He explained that what was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">absent from the seized material was any specific instructions to Mr Mulcaire to undertake</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any criminal activity that could be connected to a particular person, or &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> what</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> he</span><span style="font-style:italic"> did</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and who he sent it to and how he billed it ...&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref243" href="#footnote243">243</a></sup></span>






<!--new page--><p id="para-id-5-15"><a href="#para5-15" name="para5-15">5.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">During his evidence, however, DCS Williams appeared to assert, that there was &#8220;no evidence&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that other journalists were involved. For instance, it was put to him that it was likely, or at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">least a plausible picture, that Mr Mulcaire said to the journalist on the phone: &#8220;I&#8217;ve listened</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to celebrity X&#8217;s voicemail and this is what I can tell you is on the voicemail.&#8221; DCS Williams</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">agreed that it was a plausible picture but stated that he had no evidence of that to put before</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a court.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref244" href="#footnote244">244</a></sup> This has caused concern that DCS Williams failed to recognise the evidential value</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the matters the police had established.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-16"><a href="#para5-16" name="para5-16">5.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams is emphatic that his use of the expression<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;no</span><span style="font-style:italic"> evidence&#8221;</span> has been taken out of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context and that he did not mean that there was no evidence whatsoever, but rather that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such material as had been collected, was insufficient to prosecute. Given that DCS Williams</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was plainly aware of the material that pointed towards other journalists and was correct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in his assessment that a considerable amount of further work would have had to be done</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">before a further prosecution could have been contemplated; I am prepared to accept his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">submissions on this issue. Had he not been aware of the potential value of the evidential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">leads, he would not have considered it necessary to ask Mr Clarke to decide whether further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resources should be committed to the investigation. DCS Williams may not have labelled or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">analysed the material in his own mind as circumstantial or inferential evidence but it would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be wrong to find, in 2006 at least, that he did not appreciate that there was &#8220;some evidence&#8221;;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">as the section below demonstrates, however, that made no difference to the decision made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by Mr Clarke.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-17"><a href="#para5-17" name="para5-17">5.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Similarly, in his evidence DI Maberly explained that he believed that three of the corner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">names in particular were the names of journalists at the NoTW<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref245" href="#footnote245">245</a></sup> but went on to say:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;We</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had some inference; we had no evidence&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref246" href="#footnote246">246</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> When</span><span style="font-style:normal"> pressed,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> agreed</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> there</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstantial evidence, but went on to say (as is undoubtedly the case) that he would have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">needed something more substantial in order to obtain a conviction.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-18"><a href="#para5-18" name="para5-18">5.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I conclude this section by emphasising that it would not be fair to seek to infer from the fact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that a number of prosecutions are now being undertaken that the conclusions then reached</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the officers were wrong, let alone that they were not objectively and fairly reached. It is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obviouslyimportantnottoprejudiceorappeartopre-judgethecriminalprocessbyexpressing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">too robust a view of the material then (or now) available. There was, in my judgment, more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than enough in the Mulcaire documents to justify further work which could, itself, have led to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further evidence being uncovered, but that is a long way from saying that it would then have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been appropriate to go further; it is even further removed from being able to suggest that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision not to do so was wrong.</span>

<h3>The decision</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-19"><a href="#para5-19" name="para5-19">5.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If the investigation was to continue, DCS Williams was of the view that the next step would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a detailed analysis of the documents seized from Mr Mulcaire. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref247" href="#footnote247">247</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I knew that we would need to go through that material again, and that we would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have to do all the research in exactly the same way we&#8217;d done around the phone</span>




<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">works to see what that showed. Then I would have a better picture of is there actually</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">something here that I can either take to a judge in a production order or, probably</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more realistically, I would have taken that investigation forward, assuming that there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is something more in that material, in terms of arresting people.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-20"><a href="#para5-20" name="para5-20">5.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Surtees was also of the view that pursuing the evidential leads would have required a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;step-change&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> investigation,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> which</span><span style="font-style:normal"> would</span><span style="font-style:normal"> include</span><span style="font-style:normal"> a</span><span style="font-style:normal"> thorough</span><span style="font-style:normal"> analysis</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> material</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seized from Mr Mulcaire. For instance, he considered that the &#8220;guilty knowledge&#8221; of those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identified by the corner names would be difficult to prove and would require a full scale</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal investigation sanctioned by senior officers in SO13.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref248" href="#footnote248">248</a></sup> He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref249" href="#footnote249">249</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; in terms of widening the suspect pool, that is a protracted piece of work, because we&#8217;d</span>

<p id="para-id-5-21"><a href="#para5-21" name="para5-21">5.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This analysis of the material seized would have to have preceded an application for a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">production order because the court would expect the police to have a clear idea of what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they already had in their possession before seeking to compel the production of journalistic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material. The law requires the police to make proportionate applications, which focus on what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is strictly required. The law does not permit wide-ranging, speculative &#8220;fishing expeditions&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref250" href="#footnote250">250</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Operation Caryatid investigators would not have been in a position to identify what was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strictly required until they had ascertained what evidence they already had.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref251" href="#footnote251">251</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-22"><a href="#para5-22" name="para5-22">5.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Against that background, DCS Williams and DCS Surtees briefed Mr Clarke, Commander</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">McDowell and DCS White as to the current state of the evidence. DCS Williams said that senior</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">management were aware that the investigators believed that NI had not been cooperating</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the investigation. DCS Surtees said that during the briefing:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref252" href="#footnote252">252</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; it was made very clear that, given the unprecedented amount of operations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">currently live within SO13 and the huge demand this was having on the CT command,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this matter was not to be investigated beyond the original parameters. Moreover,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">all efforts were put into preparing the prosecution case to ensure the conviction of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire and Goodman.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-23"><a href="#para5-23" name="para5-23">5.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke explained that in order properly to analyse the material and to be in a position to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">present it as evidence in a prosecution, it would have been necessary to index the material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(manually, because at that time there was no way of scanning documents onto the HOLMES</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">system); cross-reference it; research every phone number and subject it to an individual RIPA</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">application to obtain data; and then analyse that data.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref253" href="#footnote253">253</a></sup> Mr Clarke said that it would have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been an<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;an</span><span style="font-style:italic"> enormous</span><span style="font-style:italic"> undertaking&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref254" href="#footnote254">254</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the question of the possibility of requesting support from elsewhere in the police service,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke quoted in his witness statement from his evidence before the Home Affairs Select</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Committee in July 2011:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I took the view that it would be completely unrealistic, given that we were heading</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">towards a prosecution of Goodman and Mulcaire, to then go to another department</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and say, &#8216;We&#8217;ve got a prosecution running. We have a huge amount of material here</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that needs analysing. We don&#8217;t know, given the uncertainties of the legal advice,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whether there will be further offences coming from this or not. Would you like to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">devote 50, 60, 70 officers for a protracted period to do this?&#8217; I took the judgment that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that would be an unreasonable request and so I didn&#8217;t make it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-25"><a href="#para5-25" name="para5-25">5.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke gave more detail about his rationale in his witness statement:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref255" href="#footnote255">255</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; First, given the wider context of counter terrorist operations that posed an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">immediate threat to the British public, when set against a criminal course of conduct</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that involved gross breaches of privacy but no apparent threat of physical harm to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the public, I could not justify the huge expenditure of resources this would entail over</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an inevitably protracted period. Instead a team of officers were detailed to examine</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the documents for any further evidence, and to identify potential victims where there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">might be security concerns.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Secondly, the original objectives of the investigation could be achieved through the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">following measures:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The very public prosecution and imprisonment of a senior journalist from a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">national newspaper for these offences;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Collaboration with the mobile phone industry to prevent such invasions of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">privacy in the future; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Briefings to Government, including the Home Office and Cabinet Office designed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to alert them to this activity and to ensure that national security concerns could</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">be addressed<span style="font-style:italic"> .</span> &#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-26"><a href="#para5-26" name="para5-26">5.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He added in evidence that the investigation<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;&#8230;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> honest,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> anywhere</span><span style="font-style:italic"> near</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">top of our level &#8211; our concerns because, remember, we are dealing with the airline plot and a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whole range of other terrorist operations at that time&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref256" href="#footnote256">256</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-27"><a href="#para5-27" name="para5-27">5.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A legitimate concern has been expressed that Mr Clarke&#8217;s decision was underpinned by a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">briefing from DCS Williams,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref257" href="#footnote257">257</a></sup> and therefore that he might have been told by DCS Williams</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the investigation had uncovered &#8220;no evidence&#8221; implicating other journalists, or, if DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Williams at least mentioned the evidential leads (which, as it happens, I do not doubt that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he did), he would have expressed a cautious view of their potential value or viability. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">first point to note is that throughout the investigation Mr Clarke (and indeed DCS White and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commander McDowell) received regular briefings, from both DCS Williams and DCS Surtees,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at which the evidence and potential direction of the investigation were discussed (and at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which decisions were made to limit the investigation). It is therefore not the case that before</span>



<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">being briefed in September/October 2006 Mr Clarke had no idea of the potential evidential</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">leads.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref258" href="#footnote258">258</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-28"><a href="#para5-28" name="para5-28">5.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The precise content of the briefing received by Mr Clarke cannot now be ascertained, but the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence given by Mr Clarke demonstrates that even with the fullest understanding of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">quality of the evidence, his decision would have been the same. His reaction to questions on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this issue was that he had enough information to make a properly informed decision:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref259" href="#footnote259">259</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Even though I didn&#8217;t know some of the intimate details of the case, and indeed details</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which, with hindsight, you could say were very important, I still think I had enough</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information available to me to make the overall decision about the future direction of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the inquiry, because I still can&#8217;t see any way in which we could have done that without</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">exhaustive analysis of all of that material.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-29"><a href="#para5-29" name="para5-29">5.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke agreed that it probably followed that even if one could fairly characterise the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence,particularlyinrelationtothethreejournalists,asstrongcircumstantialorinferential,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that his decision not to pursue them would have been exactly the same:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref260" href="#footnote260">260</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; Strong circumstantial evidence in terms of trying to prove a conspiracy within a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">major newspaper group, it might &#8211; it won&#8217;t get you, I would suggest, it would be very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">unlikely to get you to the position of a successful prosecution.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-30"><a href="#para5-30" name="para5-30">5.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">HewasaskedwhetherfromreviewingthedecisionlogsinpreparationfortheSelectCommittee</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hearing and having heard some of the evidence from the investigating officers during the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry, he had a different impression or understanding of the quality of the evidence insofar</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as other journalists were concerned. Mr Clarke answered as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref261" href="#footnote261">261</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It&#8217;s told me that there&#8217;s more information there &#8230; What I can say is that I haven&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">seen anything which would cause me to make a different decision than the one I did</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">then in terms of the allocation and resources, and I say that because we referred</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">earlier to the overall strategy, which was to try to bring this criminality to an end by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the prosecution of a senior, high-profile journalist, through working with the industry</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and through passing information to government.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-31"><a href="#para5-31" name="para5-31">5.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I asked Mr Clarke whether, in fact, the decision was not even close, not because of the quality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the evidence but because he was coping with 70 terrorist operations on a monumental</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scale. Mr Clarke said that this was very close to being<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;spot</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on&#8221;</span> :<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref262" href="#footnote262">262</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; because the minutiae of whether there was circumstantial evidence against</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalist A, B or C is a minor consideration in comparison with the consideration of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what poses a threat to the lives of the British public. Invasions of privacy are odious,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">obviously. They can be extraordinarily distressing and at time they can be illegal, but,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to put it bluntly, they don&#8217;t kill you. Terrorists do.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-32"><a href="#para5-32" name="para5-32">5.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke continued by explaining that it would have taken<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> huge</span><span style="font-style:italic"> amount</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> strong,</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">compelling evidence to persuade me that we should take a different course&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Even</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that,</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">however, would not have guaranteed that the matter would have been investigated further,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only that he would have had better grounds to approach another part of the police service</span>





<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">and suggest that the enormous resources required should be dedicated to the problem.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref263" href="#footnote263">263</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref264" href="#footnote264">264</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;If officers had come to me and said: &#8216;Look, we have very clear technical evidence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">here that these journalists are involved in phone hacking&#8217;, that would have given me</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">something more then to try to move the operation somewhere else, something to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">explain to colleagues why they should devote their own precious resources to what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would inevitably be an enormous operation, but that simply wasn&#8217;t there.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-33"><a href="#para5-33" name="para5-33">5.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is also worth noting that both the SIO and his deputy clearly agreed with Mr Clarke&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision. DCS Williams put it this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref265" href="#footnote265">265</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; ultimately the decision was Mr Clarke&#8217;s and I have worked with him since 2004. He</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is the most professional man that I&#8217;ve ever worked for, and I have absolute confidence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in his integrity. I totally agreed with his decision-making. We were all acutely aware</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the very difficult decisions that ultimately he would have to make and the rationale</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for it, and I do agree with it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-34"><a href="#para5-34" name="para5-34">5.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Surtees also agreed, stating that given the 70 priority terrorism investigations on-going</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at that time:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;&#8230;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> would</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> been</span><span style="font-style:italic"> absolute</span><span style="font-style:italic"> folly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> prioritise</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> outstanding</span><span style="font-style:italic"> parts</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> this</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation to the detriment of the life threatening investigations.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref266" href="#footnote266">266</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> He</span><span style="font-style:normal"> went</span><span style="font-style:normal"> on</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> make</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it clear that, despite Mr Clarke&#8217;s evident reputation for integrity, he would not have accepted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">without challenge what he perceived to be a perverse decision. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref267" href="#footnote267">267</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Had I been concerned about the legitimacy or otherwise of that decision, I would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have taken that elsewhere. What I mean by that is I clearly am alive to the fact that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we have got lines of investigation that had not been pursued in this case. The lines of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigationcouldhavebeenpursued,and,asadetective,Iwouldliketohavepursued</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">them. If Peter Clarke had made a decision based on resource, and my experience was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that there was lots of resource, and I thought the decision was perverse, then I would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have taken that elsewhere. That was absolutely not my position when the decision</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was communicated down to me. I was fully aware of where we were within the anti-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">terrorism branch or counter terrorism command at that time.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-35"><a href="#para5-35" name="para5-35">5.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Neither Mr Hayman nor Lord Blair had any apparent input into this decision. Mr Hayman could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not recall a conversation with Mr Clarke about the possible widening of the investigation to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">had turned up at the time (in relation to the number of potential victims and the corner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">names of journalists). Even if he had, he would have accepted the decision made by Mr Clarke</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not to widen the investigation because he was one of the people weighing up the competing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">demands on resources.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref269" href="#footnote269">269</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-36"><a href="#para5-36" name="para5-36">5.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Blair said that because of the huge pressures from Operation Overt, any conversation</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about something which was considered of relatively minor importance in comparison to the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">blaming Peter for this. I am merely saying another course of action could have been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">taken, and perhaps at that stage the information would have come out about there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">being lots more names and indications of a lot more people involved and then things</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would have been very different.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref274" href="#footnote274">274</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-38"><a href="#para5-38" name="para5-38">5.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whilst an alternative course may have been available to Mr Clarke, it would not be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">right to criticise Mr Clarke in any way for taking that course in the circumstances he has</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">described. He was an impressive witness. His evidence regarding the terrorist threat to life</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and his prioritisation decision was given with force and in a convincing manner. I conclude</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unhesitatingly not only that Mr Clarke was entitled to reach the decision that he did but that,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to such extent as it is appropriate for me to express an opinion, he was right to decide that no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further anti-terrorist resources would be committed to investigating the breaches of privacy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">occasioned by voicemail interception. Even if the potency of the potential evidential leads</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were not explained during the briefing, that fact made no difference to the outcome.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-39"><a href="#para5-39" name="para5-39">5.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There was no question that Mr Clarke had to satisfy the demand for resources that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terrorist threat presented and that he was forced to make resourcing decisions that might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not have been justifiable if the quantum of the threat were not so large. It was so clearly the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">correct decision that there is simply no scope for concluding that the decision was in any way</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">influenced by the relationships between some senior officers and NI staff. I have no doubt, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any event, that Mr Clarke would not have countenanced such a factor having any bearing on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his decision-making.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref275" href="#footnote275">275</a></sup></span>

<h3>Recording the decision</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-40"><a href="#para5-40" name="para5-40">5.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke said that his belief was that, in the final analysis, Commander McDowall and DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">White would have briefed him and he would have said to them:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Okay,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> go</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> see</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> SIOs,</span></span>

<p id="para-id-5-41"><a href="#para5-41" name="para5-41">5.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke went on to say that although briefing meetings were not themselves documented</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or the subject of minutes, he would expect the product of those meetings to be recorded in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the SIO&#8217;s decision log.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref279" href="#footnote279">279</a></sup> DCS Williams has contended that it would have been for Mr Clarke,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as the decision-maker, to record the decision. In this case, for whatever reason, it did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">happen: there is thus no contemporaneous written record of Mr Clarke&#8217;s decision or its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rationale. Neither is this failure simply bureaucratic: in my judgment, it was significant because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the absence of any written explanation of the rationale behind the decision but also the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidential stage that the investigation had reached along with details of the outstanding leads</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may well have had important consequences in 2009, when the then Assistant Commissioner,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">John Yates, was tasked with establishing the facts around Operation Caryatid.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref280" href="#footnote280">280</a></sup> It was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also important for another reason: it deprived the police of an important protection from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allegations of impropriety, which, in this case, have caused serious damage to the reputation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the MPS.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-42"><a href="#para5-42" name="para5-42">5.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It follows that I entirely endorse Mr Clarke&#8217;s comment that where the police decide not to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deal with a particular piece of criminality by what might be described as the conventional</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">course of arrest and prosecution, there may be circumstances where the rationale needs to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be made clear to others, so that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> sorts</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> insinuations</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> been</span><span style="font-style:italic"> made</span><span style="font-style:italic"> about</span><span style="font-style:italic"> my</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">officers who conducted that inquiry in 2006 can more easily be shown to be baseless.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref281" href="#footnote281">281</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-43"><a href="#para5-43" name="para5-43">5.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Paul Stephenson made similar comments with which I also completely agree. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref282" href="#footnote282">282</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; what do you then do with those matters that could be part of a criminal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation, but for very proper resourcing decisions you decide not to take that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">option, which is not unusual in many investigations, and I think that there are two</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relevant factors there: one, you have to ensure that if you are taking those matters</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">elsewhere, from a crime prevention perspective or to change behaviour or to deal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with victims in a better way, then you have to make sure you land those issues with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">those other agencies or government.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Secondly &#8230; you have to try and ensure, I think, in the future that we make those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decisions transparent so they can withstand this level of scrutiny.&#8221;</span>

<h3>Other possible approaches</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-44"><a href="#para5-44" name="para5-44">5.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The two conclusions that led to the investigation being curtailed were, first, that it would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been essential to undertake a full and detailed analysis of Mr Mulcaire&#8217;s documentation</span>







<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">and, second, that considerable resources would have been required to do the work. Having</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regard to the allegations that have been made, however, it was necessary to test the extent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to which those beliefs were both genuine and reasonable: having done so, it is only fair to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">record the answer. Thus, the officers were asked about the feasibility of investigative steps</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">short of such an analysis.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-45"><a href="#para5-45" name="para5-45">5.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">They were also asked whether they could have arrested the three journalists from the NoTW</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identified by DI Maberly. The four detectives roundly rejected this is as a realistic option on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the basis that, in all likelihood, the journalists would have made no comment in interview,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as did Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire; the police would have been no further forward. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to this suggestion, Mr Clarke remarked:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref283" href="#footnote283">283</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Would it be reasonable, bearing in mind that we were being completely thwarted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and receiving no co-operation from News International whatsoever, to go out and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">arrest two or three journalists, invite them to make a full and frank confession of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what they&#8217;d been doing, because we wouldn&#8217;t, without analysis of all that material,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have substantial issues to put to them? It would be a complete reverse of good</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigative practice to do that.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-46"><a href="#para5-46" name="para5-46">5.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref284" href="#footnote284">284</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;My opinion is that to do a proper and professional investigation to interview anyone,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it has to be done from a position of knowledge, and that in many investigations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">simply going and asking someone to give an explanation quite often results in &#8216;no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">comment&#8217;, in exactly the same way in my early decision logs I could have gone and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">seen Mr Goodman and it is highly unlikely that we would have got very far in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">investigation.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-47"><a href="#para5-47" name="para5-47">5.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams continued:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref285" href="#footnote285">285</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;This is my personal belief as an investigator, and maybe others will judge my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">threshold is too high, but given my experience of investigations and presenting a case</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">before a court, I obviously have a personal higher threshold than others as to what I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">believe in terms of the right thing to do in terms of reasonable ground before I start</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">depriving other people of their liberty. I do understand that you are arguing to me</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that there is a lower threshold and I could have arrested and interviewed.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-48"><a href="#para5-48" name="para5-48">5.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">DCS Surtees said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref286" href="#footnote286">286</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Whilst the most probable explanation for the corner names was that journalists at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">NOTW were in receipt of this information and that they could be aware of the illegal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">practises [sic], the difficulty was proving this. This would have meant potentially</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">arresting those journalists listed on Mulcaire&#8217;s documents. To affect [sic] this there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would need to be a full scale criminal investigation.&#8221;</span>




<!--new page--><p id="para-id-5-49"><a href="#para5-49" name="para5-49">5.49</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DI Maberly made the following observations on this subject:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref287" href="#footnote287">287</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Therewould havebeenaspectsofthecasethatIwould havelikedtohaveaskedthem</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about, but I had no firm evidence of either their knowledge of voicemail interception</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or of them tasking Mr Mulcaire. This is something that I would have looked to find</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">before speaking to them, because it would have been the case that, you know, if we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">did bring them in for questioning, the likelihood is that they would have made no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">comment, as did the other two employees of News of the World. We would have got</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">nowhere.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-50"><a href="#para5-50" name="para5-50">5.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have no difficulty in accepting that this collective view that there would have been nothing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to gain from arresting the three journalists, without further investigation, was (as Mr Clarke</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pointed out) in keeping with good investigative practice; it was both reasonable and entirely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">honestly held.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-51"><a href="#para5-51" name="para5-51">5.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As a further possibility, it was put to DCS Williams that he could have asked the NoTW to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provide him with a list of journalists, perhaps limited to particular desks. DCS Williams</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained that he would need more than a corner name that happened to be the first name</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of someone employed by the paper:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref288" href="#footnote288">288</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;To put together a criminal investigation, I wouldn&#8217;t just use that one facet. There</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would be a whole range of questions and things that I would want to get put together</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to have a cogent case as to now why am I speaking to this individual. Not simply the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fact that their name is &#8211; I&#8217;m making this up &#8211; Bill, because that&#8217;s on a corner name, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they happen to be Bill someone employed in this papers. I would need more than that.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-52"><a href="#para5-52" name="para5-52">5.52</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He repeated that he would have wanted to go through all the material because:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref289" href="#footnote289">289</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;That is a proper and professional way of carrying out a criminal investigation. It&#8217;s not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">done piecemeal or bit by bit. It&#8217;s done exhaustively, in exactly the way that actually</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">it&#8217;s being done subsequently.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-53"><a href="#para5-53" name="para5-53">5.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whilst I do not accept that, of necessity, furthering the investigation was &#8220;all or nothing&#8221;, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that certain preliminary steps could not have been taken to see what they yielded, I have no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">doubt that DCS Williams honestly held the view that the only satisfactory approach was to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examine the Mulcaire archive both systematically and comprehensively.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-54"><a href="#para5-54" name="para5-54">5.54</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The next possibility, suggested to DCS Surtees was that he could have obtained the call data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to a limited number of victims listed in the blue book and see who else might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been calling into their voicemail boxes.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref290" href="#footnote290">290</a></sup> DCS Surtees explained that the phone records</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for a given individual reveal thousands of lines of incoming telephone calls. Identifying any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given incoming caller requires a separate RIPA authorisation (which itself was a<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;laborious</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">process&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> because</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> police</span><span style="font-style:normal"> needed</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> account</span><span style="font-style:normal"> for</span><span style="font-style:normal"> their</span><span style="font-style:normal"> wish</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> intrude</span><span style="font-style:normal"> into</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> privacy</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the individual).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref291" href="#footnote291">291</a></sup> He stated that the only feasible approach, therefore, was to start with the</span>





<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">suspect&#8217;s number and look to see whether that number had accessed the voicemail account</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the potential victim.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref292" href="#footnote292">292</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-55"><a href="#para5-55" name="para5-55">5.55</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Surtees agreed that the potential victim concerned could be asked to exclude the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">numbers they recognised.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref293" href="#footnote293">293</a></sup> However, he also pointed out that the phone records would not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">show which of the incoming calls were seeking remote access to voicemail and which were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ordinary phone calls to the victim. Only Vodafone&#8217;s &#8220;Vampire&#8221; data were able to show the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">details of calls into voicemail boxes.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref294" href="#footnote294">294</a></sup> It follows that it was quite likely that even after the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individual had eliminated all the numbers he or she could recognise, the police would be left</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with many numbers which may or may not have called the voicemail box. A RIPA application</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would then have had to be made on a speculative basis, which may well have been insufficient</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to satisfy the officer charged with deciding whether to grant a RIPA authorisation, because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the number could quite easily belong to an entirely innocent party.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-56"><a href="#para5-56" name="para5-56">5.56</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Surtees was also asked whether he considered and discussed with his senior officers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a more limited investigation in the first instance, for example by targeting the most senior</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists, because he would be able to find out their relevant phone numbers. He could not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remember what conversations there were around scoping a possible future investigation or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the extent of such an investigation. He said:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> certainly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> can&#8217;t</span><span style="font-style:italic"> remember</span><span style="font-style:italic"> going</span><span style="font-style:italic"> into</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8211;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> could</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the response of DCS Surtees to the questions on this topic, that to the extent that he, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indeed DCS Williams, did not consider whether steps short of a major investigation might be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">feasible, the absence of such consideration was based on a judgment made in good faith and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not influenced by any desire to protect or propitiate NI.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-57"><a href="#para5-57" name="para5-57">5.57</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The tenor of the evidence of Mr Clarke was that he agreed with DCS Williams and DCS Surtees.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke was asked whether it would have been possible to carry out a more abbreviated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">analysis, looking at a sample of victims and the three journalists in the sight lines of DI</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Maberly. His response was:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref296" href="#footnote296">296</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; Well, potentially, but I don&#8217;t see how you could take part of that material and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">subject it to analysis with all the cross-referencing and so on that would have to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">happen, and so inevitably I think it would lead to an analysis of all the material.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-58"><a href="#para5-58" name="para5-58">5.58</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MrClarkeagreed,whenchallenged,thattherecouldhavebeenamorelimitedandstreamlined</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">analysis of the material which focussed on the three journalists. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref297" href="#footnote297">297</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I see what you&#8217;re saying and with hindsight there are probably all sorts of approaches</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that could have been taken, but in the light of what I was aware of at the time, what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I knew and the competing demands, I made the decision that we would not do so.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-59"><a href="#para5-59" name="para5-59">5.59</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, he subsequently re-stated his initial position, namely that the investigation could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not have moved forwards without an exhaustive analysis of the material.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref298" href="#footnote298">298</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-60"><a href="#para5-60" name="para5-60">5.60</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am not in a position to judge whether further tentative enquiries would have borne sufficient</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fruit to prosecute other journalists without there being a disproportionate drain on resources.</span>







<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">What matters insofar as the Terms of Reference are concerned is whether the detectives</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">honestly held the views that they did (rather than whether their views were necessarily well-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">founded) and were not influenced by any relationships between senior officers within the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MPS and NI. The evidence I heard from each of them, and how they have justified their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decisions, gives me no cause to doubt that their decisions were unaffected by the fact that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the target of the further investigation would have been NI journalists or editors.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-61"><a href="#para5-61" name="para5-61">5.61</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is fair to add that DCS Williams also had concerns about whether the huge resource injection</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he believed would be required to take the investigation further would be justified by what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">such an investigation might realistically yield (which itself might have added to his cautious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach). He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref299" href="#footnote299">299</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;All along, I &#8211; we had some grounds to suspect that this could be wider and that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">indeed if we undertook further research we may find something. What I didn&#8217;t know</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and what I was clear about is what we would find, and actually what it would amount</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to. What I was very cognisant of, as indeed we all were, was the amount of work it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had taken to get us to where we were, particularly in terms of the technical difficulties.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The other dimension that we were very conscious of is we had achieved that in a</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">covert operation, where nobody knew what we were doing, nobody understood what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we were looking for, and they couldn&#8217;t hide evidence. At the moment this was now</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">very clear about what we were doing and what evidence we were looking for, and it is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not unreasonable to think that it would be a far more challenging operation in terms</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the implication of the resources that you would need.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-62"><a href="#para5-62" name="para5-62">5.62</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams went further because, when asked whether there was any sense that he was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taking on a large and powerful organisation and that there were dangers in doing so, he</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref300" href="#footnote300">300</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think with any large organisation, yes, we were aware of it in terms of a big</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">organisation, which is why we carried out such a thorough investigation, why we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sought so much advice from the CPS, in particular in terms of when it came to our</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">arrest phase, because we wanted to be able to seize as much evidence as possible</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and do it in a proper and professional manner so that we could not be criticised for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the way we carried out our investigation.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-63"><a href="#para5-63" name="para5-63">5.63</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I accept the evidence that, if anything, the fact that he was investigating a large organisation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made it all the more important that DCS Williams did a good job, both in terms of the way the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation was conducted and in ensuring that the evidence was sound. Reading between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the lines, it was likely to have been within his contemplation that if there were any flaws</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the investigation process or the evidence, they would be exploited to the fullest extent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">possible by the organisation&#8217;s legal team. It is likely that this mind set also contributed to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cautious approach that DCS Williams took to the evidence.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-64"><a href="#para5-64" name="para5-64">5.64</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, it has been argued that all that would have been needed to include additional</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists on the indictment would have been to ask NI for a list of journalists and cross-</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">refer the list with the corner names. It is suggested that this would be virtually the same</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence as was used to convict Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire. It is right, as DCS Williams</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained in evidence, that the evidence in support of counts 16 to 20 comprised a high</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">volume of frequency of calls made by Mr Mulcaire to the relevant voicemail box and the</span>


<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">duration of those calls.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref301" href="#footnote301">301</a></sup> However, the approach suggested is too simplistic not least because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the evidence implicating Mr Goodman in the conspiracy went significantly beyond his name</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appearing in the top corner of Mr Mulcaire&#8217;s notes.</span>

<h3>Influence of News International</h3>

<p id="para-id-5-65"><a href="#para5-65" name="para5-65">5.65</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It has also been argued that there is a strong implication that the conduct of DCS Williams</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(in telling counsel, the CPS and subsequently Mr Yates that there was no evidence that any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other journalists were involved and in later not pursuing the agreed strategy of informing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">victims) derived from his fear of the powerful media friends of his superiors and reflects a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wider institutional fear of NI and his awareness of the close social relationships fostered by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the company with his superiors. It has been contended that although there is no evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that DCS Williams made any conscious decision to suppress evidence, it is inevitable that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationships exerted some influence on his decision-making.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-66"><a href="#para5-66" name="para5-66">5.66</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In relation to this aspect of the case, I reject these arguments. First, quite apart from whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams was aware of any close social relationships, if such there were, there is no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence that any decision that he made as to the investigation was not entirely justifiable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on logical and reasonable grounds; from the outset, he pursued it vigorously and effectively.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The ultimate decision (as it has been called) was made by Mr Clarke. As to the attitude to the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation, DCS Williams said that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref302" href="#footnote302">302</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; no one in my team had any contact with any of the newspapers, and I can assure</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you at no time in that investigation was it ever an issue, did we ever discuss it, did it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ever influence the direction that we went in with that investigation.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-67"><a href="#para5-67" name="para5-67">5.67</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, DCS Williams did not suppress evidence; and I have accepted that DCS Williams was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not intending to convey to counsel or the CPS that there was no evidence whatsoever to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">implicate other journalists, only that there was insufficient evidence to lay before a criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Court.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref303" href="#footnote303">303</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-5-68"><a href="#para5-68" name="para5-68">5.68</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Suffice to say, having seen the senior members of the investigating team, I have no doubt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that they approached their task with complete integrity. Neither do I doubt their enthusiasm</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or their desire to investigate the criminality before them to the fullest extent possible within</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the limits of the resources available to them. I am satisfied that had Mr Clarke, at the end of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">September 2006, sanctioned the exhaustive analysis of the documentation seized from Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire, the investigators would have embarked on that task with the zeal and rigour they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had demonstrated since Operation Caryatid had begun.</span>

<p id="para-id-5-69"><a href="#para5-69" name="para5-69">5.69</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Given how little was known about voicemail interception when the investigation began in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">December 2005 and the challenges involved in understanding how the interceptions were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taking place and then proving the interceptions, it could only have been (and was) a robust,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">tenacious, well-motivated and skilful team that could have secured such extensive evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire were driven to admit their guilt. I do not find they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were deterred in their investigation by fear of getting on the wrong side of such a powerful</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisation or displeasing senior management by risking damage to the MPS&#8217;s working</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship with NI.</span>



<!--new page--><p id="para-id-5-70"><a href="#para5-70" name="para5-70">5.70</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As an indication of DCS Surtees&#8217; enthusiasm in particular, I note that he said in evidence that,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when producing his search strategy:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref304" href="#footnote304">304</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I wanted very much to get into News International, because I wanted to search the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">desk, I wanted to search the financial areas, I wanted to find evidence around who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was involved in this illegal activity.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-71"><a href="#para5-71" name="para5-71">5.71</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Also, when asked whether he would have liked there to have been a full scale criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation into other journalists, his answer was:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;absolutely&#8221;.</span> He explained, however, that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he understood the priorities:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref305" href="#footnote305">305</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;So in terms of what I would have liked to have done coupled with my obligations and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the seriousness of the investigations I was involved in, I knew where my priorities lay,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and those were with the issues of serious threat to life investigations. That&#8217;s where I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">needed to be and that&#8217;s where my staff needed to be.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-72"><a href="#para5-72" name="para5-72">5.72</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On this topic, Mr Clarke observed that<span style="font-style:italic"> :</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;[the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> investigating</span><span style="font-style:italic"> officers]</span><span style="font-style:italic"> conducted</span><span style="font-style:italic"> an</span><span style="font-style:italic"> honest</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">inquiry, they were uninfluenced, as was I, by anything to do with News International or any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mediagroup.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref306" href="#footnote306">306</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Inthecontextofhisevidenceabout</span><span style="font-style:normal"> theperceptioncausedbyhisrelationships</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with individuals from NI, Mr Hayman stressed:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref307" href="#footnote307">307</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I can absolutely accord with your point around perception, but I can tell you that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the team on it are ferocious, they have a reputation of being ferocious, and if, let&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">say, there is a scenario, which some people have argued around the conspiracy that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there was a not such ferociousness around because of a perceived relationship, it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was impossible, in my view. If you wanted to be disproportionate towards those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">alleged perpetrators, or you wanted to dilute down the investigation, the security and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">parameters that were set by the SIO would make that impossible. And if I personalise</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that, if there was an agenda from me or any other person, Assistant Commissioner,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who wanted to dilute or disproportionately ramp up that operation, it would be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">impossible for that to happen without the SIO calling foul or asking for that individual</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to record why they want something done in that decision log.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-5-73"><a href="#para5-73" name="para5-73">5.73</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Because of the serious concern expressed, this aspect of the police operation has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examined in detail. In the circumstances, I ought finally to record the views of the independent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Queen&#8217;s Counsel instructed to advise and conduct the prosecution, who dealt with the officers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on a regular basis. David Perry QC said of the police and CPS staff involved:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref308" href="#footnote308">308</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; my impression throughout this case, which was not an easy case, given all the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sensitivities as well as the technical aspects and the difficult issues of law, was that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">everyone involved, both at the Crown Prosecution Service and in the police, were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">conscientiously attempting to do their jobs professionally and with some skill, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my distinct impression at the end of it all was that it was an example of collaborative</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">efforts on the part of the Crown Prosecution Service and the police that had led on</span>





<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the face of it at any rate to a successful outcome on the facts of this case. I must say,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I found everyone involved highly skilled, competent and professional.&#8221;</span>

<h2>6. Police strategy for the aftermath</h2>

<h3>The victim notification strategy</h3>

<p id="para-id-6-1"><a href="#para6-1" name="para6-1">6.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In order to examine how the police intended to address issues concerning the victims of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail interception, it is necessary to return to 24 August 2006 (three days after the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conference with counsel) on which date DCS Williams met with Mr Clarke and DCS White.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke&#8217;s recollection is that the purpose of the meeting was to devise and produce a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">victim notification strategy.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref309" href="#footnote309">309</a></sup> Mr Clarke said that he agreed the strategy at the meeting<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref310" href="#footnote310">310</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and expected it to be implemented and seen through.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref311" href="#footnote311">311</a></sup> He said that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref312" href="#footnote312">312</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Bearing in mind that there had been very close co-operation between my officers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and the mobile phone industry throughout the investigation, it was agreed that after</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the arrests there would be a strategy for informing victims whereby police officers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would inform certain categories of potential victim, and the mobile phone companies</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would identify and inform others.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-2"><a href="#para6-2" name="para6-2">6.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clarke was asked whether it was his intention that the 418 names on the original list of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potential victims, which was prepared shortly after 8 August 2006, would be notified one way</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or the other, either directly by the police or by the mobile phone companies. Mr Clarke said:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Yes, absolutely&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref313" href="#footnote313">313</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Clarke</span><span style="font-style:normal"> said</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> did</span><span style="font-style:normal"> not</span><span style="font-style:normal"> have</span><span style="font-style:normal"> any</span><span style="font-style:normal"> oversight</span><span style="font-style:normal"> over</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> execution</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">in Operation Overt.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref314" href="#footnote314">314</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-3"><a href="#para6-3" name="para6-3">6.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams said that he wrote the outcome of the discussion in a document entitled</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">document:</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There is a need to establish definitely how many victims there are, i.e. how many</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people have had their voicemails (UVNs) rung by Mulcaire/Goodman. With that in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mind all 5 of the UK mobile phone companies have been asked to search their UVN</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">equivalents for any of our &#8216;suspect&#8217; phone numbers calling them going as far back as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">possible &#8211; up to one year, dependant [sic] upon data retention. Time frame &#8211; up to 3</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">weeks, but variable due to Op Overt.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">&#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Using the information that will come from the mobile phone service providers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">together with an assessment of material seized, police/Council [sic] can choose an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">appropriate range of &#8216;victims&#8217; &#8211; subject to their agreement &#8211; to add to the charges.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The list of victims will then represent the most definitive list of people who have had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">their voicemails &#8216;intercepted&#8217;.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There is arguably a duty to inform people when they have been a victim of crime and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in this case I believe that duty should be undertaken for those people who we know</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are victims by virtue of the fact that our suspects called their voicemails (UVNs). That</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">list will be identified as above and the next step is to decide when and how they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">should be informed.</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;Issues to bear in mind if informing victims</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Informing all of the victims could be resource intensive which SO13 can ill afford at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this juncture given the current terrorist threat.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">From all that is known, the risk to the victims does not extend to a risk to life or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">serious injury/damage to property, but rather the goal of the criminality is to seek</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">material of media interest &#8211; typically salacious gossip!</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Arguably any immediate and future risk has been negated by virtue of the fact that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">police now hold the suspects data on their victims and the fact that they have been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">detected acts as a deterrent for them or anyone else to target these victims.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Although the techniques for voicemail interception may not be limited to these</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">suspects it is unlikely these two will have shared them with a wider audience given</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the potential earning value of the technique. Equally our investigation to date has not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">identified any other suspects calling the UVNs of our main victims.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There is a rationale for saying that the risk to victims has been significantly reduced</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">due to police action and therefore a more measured and proportionate approach can</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be taken in terms of who and when the victims are informed.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">Options</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">In terms of the, who and when, the following are options:&#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">1. Given the rationale outlined above, do not inform any victims beyond those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who will be used in the prosecution.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2. As per 1 above, but extend the victims to be informed to include anyone who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">falls into the category of MP, Royal Household, Police and Military on the basis</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that although there is nothing to suspect personal safety or national security</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is being targeted, these are people for whom being those aspects could be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a collateral risk. The latter four categories would include those that are on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire&#8217;s list whether or not any investigation shows that their UVN has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been dialled.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">3. Inform all victims i.e. whose voicemails have been called.</span>
<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">4. As per 3 above, but vary the when and how. The four categories identified in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">option 2 should be informed now and the remainder can be informed once</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the definitive list is complete following responses from the phone companies.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Police would lead on informing the former group whereas the latter group</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could be informed by the respective &#8216;victim&#8217; phone company via an agreed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">police/mobile phone companies&#8217; letter.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Recommended Option</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Option 4 is my preferred option because:&#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It deals with the risks to individuals in a proportionate manner.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Is a proportionate use of police resources that are hard pressed across the MPS?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The responsibility and resource implications are shared with the phone companies.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The phone companies are the most effective and efficient means of contacting the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">victims in the majority of cases.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Police have the appropriate channels to contact the police/military/MP/Royal victims.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-4"><a href="#para6-4" name="para6-4">6.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams explained in his witness statement that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref316" href="#footnote316">316</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; I felt that there was arguably a duty to inform people who may have been a victim</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of crime in this case and I felt that this was best defined by &#8216;for those people who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we know are victims by virtue of the fact that our suspects called their voicemails.&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">If those people could be identified it was a case of by whom, how and when those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people would be informed. The rationale for such a distinction was based upon a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proportionate sharing of the resources that would be required, the level of risk/harm</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and who, police or service providers, had the best discrete [sic] channels to carry out</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">the task.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-5"><a href="#para6-5" name="para6-5">6.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He provided additional insight into his thinking at the time during the course of his briefing to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Assistant Commissioner, John Yates, in 2009:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref317" href="#footnote317">317</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;At the time the strategy recognised that there was still extensive research to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">done with the phone companies to identify what the full extent of victims might be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and therefore as outlined under the section above<span style="font-weight:bold"> &#8216;How</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> were</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> victims</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> identified&#8217;</span> this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could be a vastly bigger group of people and in reality we would probably never know</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the true scale. This strategy was therefore seeking to alert potential past victims in a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">proportionate manner without causing undue alarm (i.e. contact via Phone Company</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as opposed to police) and set in motion measures within the overall mobile phone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">industry to prevent it happening in the future.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-6"><a href="#para6-6" name="para6-6">6.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In summary therefore, the plan was for the police to notify immediately those identified in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the blue book (the 418 individuals) who fell into the category of MP, Royal Household, Police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Military, regardless of whether there was evidence that their voicemail boxes had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dialled by the suspect numbers. Individuals outside those four categories would be notified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provided their voicemail box had been rung by Mr Goodman or Mr Mulcaire or both<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref318" href="#footnote318">318</a></sup> but</span>



<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">irrespective of whether there was a &#8220;new&#8221; or &#8220;old&#8221; message in the voicemail box.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref319" href="#footnote319">319</a></sup> DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Williams explained that this latter group of victims would comprise those in the blue book</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whose voicemails had been rung by the suspect numbers (but who were not MPs, members</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Royal Household, police of military) and any additional individuals that the phone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">companies brought to their attention.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref320" href="#footnote320">320</a></sup> It was not sufficient that they merely appeared in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Mulcaire papers or were listed in the blue book.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref321" href="#footnote321">321</a></sup> This latter group of individuals would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be informed by their phone company, by way of a letter agreed between the police and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">phone company, but not until the phone companies had responded to the request that they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identify as many of their customers as they could whose voicemail boxes had been rung by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the suspect numbers (so that a<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;definitive&#8221;</span> list could be compiled).</span>

<p id="para-id-6-7"><a href="#para6-7" name="para6-7">6.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I find that it was reasonable for the police to put in place a three-track strategy for the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecution: namely (i) conducting a high-profile but limited prosecution (limited in terms</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of victims named on the indictment); (ii) alerting the phone companies so that they could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">improve security and change their procedures as appropriate and (iii) warning people who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were the subject of criminal attention. However, the victim notification strategy was both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">poorly thought out and scarcely executed.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-8"><a href="#para6-8" name="para6-8">6.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The plan lacked coherence. A considerable amount of work had been invested in the blue</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">book, which provided a list of potential victims (as DCS Surtees intended).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref322" href="#footnote322">322</a></sup> Plainly, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police should have ensured that all those named in the blue book were notified and the plan</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should have been devised on that basis. I see no reason for believing that this would have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been a disproportionate drain on resources. Instead, the detail of the strategy was such that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it excluded people listed in the blue book but in respect of whom there was no evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that their voicemails had been called by the suspect numbers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref323" href="#footnote323">323</a></sup> The strategy therefore</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">overlooked people who were identified in the blue book, and in respect of whom Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire had the wherewithal to access the voicemail accounts, but whose voicemails may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been accessed by an as yet unidentified suspect number, such as a number belonging</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to someone other than Mr Goodman or Mr Mulcaire. This ought to have been within DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Williams&#8217; contemplation given his strong suspicion that journalists other than Mr Goodman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been involved in voicemail interception. The strategy also overlooked the fact that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">phone companies only held their records for a short period of time and it thereby excluded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those whose voicemails had been accessed by the identified suspect numbers but at such an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">early date that the relevant records had not been retained.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-9"><a href="#para6-9" name="para6-9">6.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams was asked why everyone named in the blue book was not notified. His response</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">was:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref324" href="#footnote324">324</a></sup></span>






<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;But I believe the implementation of this strategy was all I&#8217;d got there is a snapshot</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in time from the material that we happened to have received. There could well be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a wider pool of people that have been compromised as a result of his activity or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">indeed anywhere else. So this strategy was aimed at the full potential of what those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">potential victims might be. So that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s actually in the when and the how that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I&#8217;m seeking or I was hoping through this strategy to address that much wider pool of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people, which would have included everybody on that list.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This answer suggests that DCS Williams failed to recognise that the ambit of the strategy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">simply did not encompass, even theoretically, everyone identified in the blue book.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-10"><a href="#para6-10" name="para6-10">6.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Without suggesting to DCS Surtees that it was his responsibility to do so, it was put to him</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it would not have been an enormous task to contact everyone in the blue book and make</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sure that everyone was told that there was some information that their voicemail messages</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may have been intercepted, that it may not be possible to prosecute for reasons that could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be explained, but that they ought to be aware of that fact and take appropriate security</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arrangements or, at least, be alert.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref325" href="#footnote325">325</a></sup> DCS Surtees responded as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref326" href="#footnote326">326</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I accept that. In terms of the Blue Book and in terms of the document that was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">produced later, which was a document produced as a result of the analysis of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">electronic media, which I think came to us on 23 November 2006, in relation to both</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">those documents, I accept that, the Metropolitan Police, could have approached all</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of those people and said, &#8216;Look what is on a piece of paper&#8217;, or, &#8216;Look what is on a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">document and look how it relates to you&#8217;. I accept that.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-11"><a href="#para6-11" name="para6-11">6.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Inmyview,thepoliceoughteithertohaveinformedthosenamedinthebluebookthemselves,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or have agreed with the phone companies that the latter would do so, and given them the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">means to do so by providing the list of names. The police ought then to have checked with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the phone companies to ensure that all relevant individuals had been informed. Insofar as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the police had concerns about their obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998 when</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">giving any names to the phone companies, this was a matter that could doubtless have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discussed and resolved: ultimately, the police could have avoided those concerns by informing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those individuals themselves.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-12"><a href="#para6-12" name="para6-12">6.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Unfortunately, not only was the strategy ill-conceived but, in addition, its execution was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">woefully inadequate. The evidence indicates that the police did not notify all the victims</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for whom they were responsible and neither does it appear that the plan was ever, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terms, communicated to the phone companies, despite a large part of the responsibility for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">informing victims being intended to fall on them. The police appear to have assumed that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">having been asked to identify any customers whose voicemail boxes had been called by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suspect numbers, the phone companies would naturally inform all those that they identified.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-13"><a href="#para6-13" name="para6-13">6.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams explained his thinking as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref327" href="#footnote327">327</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;When I wrote the strategy, it was based on what I believed was already happening</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in terms of our relationship with the service providers and as the case progressed to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">prosecution that ongoing support, discovery, cooperation and joint media releases</span>



<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">served to reinforce my belief. I believed the strategy was being carried out as an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ongoing process and I had merely formalised the process at a moment in time with the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">official endorsement of my senior management.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-14"><a href="#para6-14" name="para6-14">6.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams even appears to have contemplated that the phone companies would identify</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potential victims and notify them without giving the police their names. DCS Williams:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref328" href="#footnote328">328</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; Albeit all of the companies and police were pragmatic in sharing data in what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">potentially would bring us to an administrative halt if we went down the full process,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">neither party was willing to share long lists of names for obvious privacy/data</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">protection reasons. Therefore the informing potential victim strategy embraced these</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">issues by providing the optimum, discrete [sic] means of informing anyone who was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">identified as a potential victim supported by a single, well worn route for those who</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">may wish to report the matter to police.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-15"><a href="#para6-15" name="para6-15">6.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Surtees described it as his &#8220;understanding&#8221; that the telephone companies would tell</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those other than MPs, members of the military, members of the Royal Household and police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that their phones had potentially been accessed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref329" href="#footnote329">329</a></sup> He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref330" href="#footnote330">330</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Mobile phone companies had continued from the outset of the investigation to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">provide us with details of other customers who had their voicemails intercepted. At</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">no time did I or indeed anybody else from the police team ask for this to stop, even</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">post arrest and charge. The issue of the obligation to inform customers/victims to my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">knowledge was never explicitly documented anywhere either by the police or indeed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the telephone companies. O2 were adamant that they would only inform us of possible</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">victims after they had informed their customers and sought consent<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref331" href="#footnote331">331</a></sup> . My view was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the telephone companies were responsible for their customers, as is the case in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other areas of business such as in the banking industry.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Whilst I was not explicit as to what these companies should do around informing and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">keeping their customers up to date, I held the belief that this was, in fact, being done.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">To further reinforce this I ensured that the phone companies, especially those not as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">close to the investigation as the two mentioned herein, were briefed, and, through</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Jack Wraith, that any victims were directed back to this investigation. Like with O2, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">emphasis was still very much on the phone companies to deal with their customers in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a professional manner. The telephone companies knew which of their customers were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">subject to illegal access because it was they who told us in the first place. At no time</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were they ever restricted from informing those customers, although the extent of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information passed would be limited. Further, it was not for the police to dictate to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">private companies how to execute their internal procedures and how to deal with their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">own customers.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-16"><a href="#para6-16" name="para6-16">6.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It does appear, therefore, that no attempt was even made to agree the strategy with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">phone companies. In addition, there is no evidence of joint letters being agreed with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">phone companies, despite this being the intention identified by the strategy. Furthermore,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">none of the phone companies have stated that they were asked, either before or after this</span>




<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">strategy was drafted, formally to notify any particular category of customer that they were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the potential victim of voicemail interception.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref332" href="#footnote332">332</a></sup> It is right that O2 did notify a number of their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">customers, but it appears that they did so of their own initiative and not because they were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">asked to by the police as part of the victim notification strategy. I therefore do not accept the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">argument of the MPS that the failure of the strategy was due to a misunderstanding between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the MPS and the phone companies as to which categories of victims should be informed and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by whom. The strategy failed because the MPS did not take the necessary steps to put it into</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">effect.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-17"><a href="#para6-17" name="para6-17">6.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As late as 2009, when briefing Mr Yates, DCS Williams and DCS Surtees did not even appear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to have been aware that the strategy had failed. In a briefing note dated 12 July 2009, they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stated:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref333" href="#footnote333">333</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">&#8220;Itisnotknownindetailwhateachmobilephonecompanyactuallydid,butanecdotally</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">we know that upon learning of the flaws in their processes the phone companies took</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">steps prevent future breaches and albeit these measures varied from company to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">company they included contacting customers who they thought might have been a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">victim &#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-18"><a href="#para6-18" name="para6-18">6.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When making its opening statement to the Inquiry, the MPS fully accepted that the victim</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">notification strategy was not properly executed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref334" href="#footnote334">334</a></sup> The failure is now being remedied as part</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Operation Weeting. The MPS states that it accepts that it should have done more to ensure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the strategy was fully implemented, but argues that this needs to be seen in the context of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the huge demand on what became SO15 resources in 2006-7, as a result of several major</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">counter terrorism operations.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-19"><a href="#para6-19" name="para6-19">6.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Surtees has also added that the decision made by Mr Clarke not to expend any further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resources on the operation affected the victim notification strategy. He said that after the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision had been made not to expand the investigation, he received the direction that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">staff should only service the prosecution, and consequently, there were no staff to follow</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">up with the phone companies what they were doing regarding victim notification.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref335" href="#footnote335">335</a></sup> It does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not, however, seem that anyone went back to Mr Clarke and reminded him of the resources</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">needed to implement the strategy which, in outline, he had approved.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-20"><a href="#para6-20" name="para6-20">6.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In my judgment, these resource considerations simply do not explain why the basic steps</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">required were not taken to ensure that the phone companies were aware of what the police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expected them to do and agreed both to do it and to the terms of a joint letter. The decision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made by Mr Clarke and the demand on resources may provide some explanation (but no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">excuse) for why these important steps in the process were apparently overlooked but the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">significance of the failure should not be minimised: it was a failure to take even basic steps to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">follow up the strategy and to ensure that it had worked as intended. Mr Clarke expressed his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">regret for the failure of the strategy in his witness statement:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref336" href="#footnote336">336</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I have since learned that this strategy did not work as intended and as former</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Assistant Commissioner John Yates has publicly acknowledged, that is a matter of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">profound regret. It is also of course utterly regrettable that as a result of the decision</span>





<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not to conduct a detailed analysis of all the material seized, victims of crime and their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relatives, who I had no idea were the targets of the hackers, were not notified and did</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not receive the support that they deserved sooner.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-21"><a href="#para6-21" name="para6-21">6.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The failure of the victim notification strategy reduced the opportunity for other victims to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">make themselves known and created a perception that has caused significant damage to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reputation of the MPS. Once again, the important question is whether there is an evidential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">basis for finding that the police deliberately failed to notify people because they did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">want the scale of the interceptions to be known publicly, which might itself have called into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question both their strategy and their relationship with NI. The MPS contends forcefully that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the failure of the strategy had nothing to do with inappropriately close relationships with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(or fear of) members of the press, or any of the risks arising from such relationships as there</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">were.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-22"><a href="#para6-22" name="para6-22">6.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">During his evidence Mr Clarke emphasised that his hope had been that the victim notification</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strategy would be comprehensive and would work. He said: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> Sadly,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> turned</span><span style="font-style:italic"> out</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">case and to this day I don&#8217;t really understand why it didn&#8217;t work&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref337" href="#footnote337">337</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-23"><a href="#para6-23" name="para6-23">6.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref338" href="#footnote338">338</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;This strategy &#8230; did not seek to hide the potential to be a &#8216;victim&#8217; of this behaviour. Far</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from it, the whole aim was to secure maximum public awareness of the vulnerability</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">through an effective and decisive criminal prosecution...&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-24"><a href="#para6-24" name="para6-24">6.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams was asked whether it was a fair observation that part of the reason for the failure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the strategy was the fear that notifying all potential victims would mean the matter would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enter the public domain more explosively and force the police to carry out an investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which they did not really want. DCS Williams said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref339" href="#footnote339">339</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not. I understand that&#8217;s what&#8217;s being said now, but I can assure you that was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">absolutely not the intention. I wanted to make this as public as possible, and the most</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">obvious way of doing that is through a prosecution. If I hadn&#8217;t have wanted to have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">done it, I could have stopped this investigation much earlier, but that was absolutely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not my intention. It was to secure a prosecution, to make this very public, and actually</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the wider and long term, to make it absolutely clear what the risks were and how</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to prevent it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-25"><a href="#para6-25" name="para6-25">6.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It has been asserted that the failure to alert Lord Prescott, in particular, to the fact that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was a potential victim<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref340" href="#footnote340">340</a></sup> strongly supports the allegation that the police deliberately avoided</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">notifying certain victims since, if Lord Prescott had been alerted, he is likely to have reacted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to this revelation in such a way which would have made it very difficult for the police not to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expand the investigation. It is important to note that, on 30 August 2006 DI Maberly emailed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Vodafone asking if they could tell him whether anyone has listened to the voicemail of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of people, which included &#8220;Tracey Temple (Prescott)&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref341" href="#footnote341">341</a></sup> Clearly he was a suspected</span>





<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">victim. Further, on 2 October 2006, DI Maberly emailed O2 identifying two persons of concern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and asking O2 if they featured in the analysis O2 was preparing: the first name was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Joan</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Hammell (linked to prezza)&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref342" href="#footnote342">342</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> DCS</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Williams</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> asked</span><span style="font-style:normal"> about</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> material</span><span style="font-style:normal"> relating</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Lord</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prescott. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref343" href="#footnote343">343</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether I knew that specific bit in the sense of it sat here in this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interview. What I was briefed about was, yes, there are now from the material a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">number of other people in all walks of life, that include politicians, where it may be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that they are potentially people who Mulcaire or others might want to target in terms</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of their voicemail.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-26"><a href="#para6-26" name="para6-26">6.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is extremely unfortunate that, apparently, DCS Williams was not made fully aware of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fact that the investigators suspected that Lord Prescott had been or, at the very least, was at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">risk of being, a victim, not least because of the significance of his position as Deputy Prime</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Minister.Ontheotherhand,Iconsiderithighlyunlikelythatthisomissionortheconsequential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">failure to inform Lord Prescott was deliberate. The police had devised a strategy for bringing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the matter to public attention, which included notification of specifically identified victims. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not their overall intention that was at fault but, rather, the detail of the strategy and its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">implementation. It would be remarkable to embark on the exercise if their intention was to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">keephiddenwhattheyhad found. Inthecircumstances,itwould notbesafeorfairtoconclude</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the failure of the strategy was either a device to minimise publicity or avoid scrutiny or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an attempt to &#8216;bury&#8217; the scale of the problem. As DCS Surtees explained in evidence:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref344" href="#footnote344">344</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There was a communication strategy which was devised in 2006 and it was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">multifaceted. It dealt with the information that was put out for offer. Two people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had been arrested, two people had been charged with these offences. There was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">various media lines put out throughout the process: two men have pleaded guilty and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">then latterly two men have been sent to prison. So there were through the process</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of August into January 2007 a number of media lines put out and a lot of media</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">coverage as a result of that.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-27"><a href="#para6-27" name="para6-27">6.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further, the police informed the PCC<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref345" href="#footnote345">345</a></sup> and Mr Clarke is absolutely clear in his mind that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made the government aware of the investigation when Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been arrested. He said in his witness statement:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref346" href="#footnote346">346</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I recall discussing the case with Dr John Reid, the then Home Secretary, shortly after</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Goodman and Mulcaire had been arrested. This was in the margins of a meeting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about broader counter terrorism issues in the immediate aftermath of the Operation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Overt arrests, and was of little significance other than to demonstrate that the Home</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Office had been informed of the arrests and the broad nature of the case that was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">alleged against Goodman and Mulcaire.&#8221;</span>





<!--new page--><p id="para-id-6-28"><a href="#para6-28" name="para6-28">6.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Reid confirmed this to the extent that he agreed it was quite possible that the subject of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their arrests was mentioned informally by Mr Clarke though he personally does not recall a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">specific conversation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref347" href="#footnote347">347</a></sup> He added:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref348" href="#footnote348">348</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I do recall the issue being touched upon much later in one conversation with the Met</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Commissioner towards the end of my period in office &#8230; My recollection is of being</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">told that work continued following the recent trial that had concluded in late January</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2007; that there was a considerable amount of material arising out of the trial and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the investigations related to it; but that material did not equal evidence, and it would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">take some time to work through it with a view to gathering evidence.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-29"><a href="#para6-29" name="para6-29">6.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This evidence is difficult to reconcile with the fact that, towards the end of September</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2006, Mr Clarke decided that no further analysis of the material would take place. Lord Reid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">continued as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref349" href="#footnote349">349</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;So that was certainly my impression when I left office, that having carried out</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the convictions on Goodman and Mulcaire, that now what was being done on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">generality of it because there were other suspected victims of this.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think it was my final meeting. I can&#8217;t be sure of that, but I think the final meeting</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was around May with Ian.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-30"><a href="#para6-30" name="para6-30">6.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Reid said that he was never made aware that were perhaps hundreds of victims and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">thousands of names or that Lord Prescott was one of names in which Mr Mulcaire could be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seen to be interested, whether or not his phone messages or the phone messages of one his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">staff were actually the subject of interception.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref350" href="#footnote350">350</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-31"><a href="#para6-31" name="para6-31">6.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Not only do I conclude that a deliberate failure to inform victims was inconsistent with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evident desire of the police to bring the matter to public attention generally, but neither do I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">find it plausible that the officers concerned would devise a victim notification strategy which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they never intended to execute. Further, for all the reasons that I have previously set out, I do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not believe that the failure of the strategy was influenced in any way by or connected to any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inappropriate relationship between the MPS and NI. By far the more plausible explanation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the failure of the notification strategy is that SO13, having been successful in its primary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">objective, simply took its eye off the ball in circumstances where it was extremely keen to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">return to what might be described as its core business, namely counter-terrorism.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-32"><a href="#para6-32" name="para6-32">6.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It has also been argued that when the police did notify victims, they favoured media contacts.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For instance, Mrs Brooks was informed that she was a victim and, on 13 October 2006, DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Surtees emailed the Mail on Sunday a list of five members of staff who had been found to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be the victim of voicemail interception.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref351" href="#footnote351">351</a></sup> It is said that this position is to be contrasted with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that of Brian Paddick, Lord Prescott and Simon Hughes. Brian Paddick was a Commander</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">serving with the MPS at the material time; his name appeared in the project list created by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the High Tech Crime Unit from information held on Mr Mulcaire&#8217;s computer. Indeed, the High</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Tech Crime Unit had specifically highlighted his name in the introduction to the document</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as someone about whom attempts had been made to obtain information. There were also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">references in Mr Mulcaire&#8217;s papers which included the name of Mr Paddick, his address,</span>





<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">his mobile phone number and other phone numbers. It was only in 2010 that Mr Paddick</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was informed. Further, although Rt Hon Simon Hughes MP was an identified victim and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subject of one of the charges in the criminal trial, he was not told that Mr Mulcaire had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recorded in his notebook not only details about him but also his friends and family along with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the names of three NoTW journalists other than Mr Goodman.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref352" href="#footnote352">352</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-33"><a href="#para6-33" name="para6-33">6.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I can well understand the reason for the concern that these witnesses had about the approach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the police which underlines the failure adequately to enunciate and implement a sensible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and appropriate policy of notifying those who needed to know that their communications</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may not have been secure and their privacy had been violated or, at the very least, at risk. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might have been as a result of direct notification or by involving mobile phone companies but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it had to be done and steps taken to ensure that it had been done. Having said that, the police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did notify a number of those who were not related to the media (including, for instance,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">George Galloway who was told on 24 August 2006). In the circumstances, I consider that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undoubted failures of notification are not the result of cover-up or preferential treatment and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">favouritism towards the press but rather of poor strategy, and poor implementation of such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strategy as existed with insufficient consideration to the importance that many if not most of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the victims would attach to learning what had or might have happened to them.</span>

<h3>The failure to warn NI or challenge the &#8220;one rogue reporter&#8221; assertion</h3>


<p id="para-id-6-34"><a href="#para6-34" name="para6-34">6.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The police were aware that there were very strong grounds for believing that journalists at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NI, other than Mr Goodman, had been involved in unlawful voicemail interception. They</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had identified that the practice might be widespread. However justifiable their decision not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to follow the evidential leads implicating other journalists might have been, that approach,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">brought with it an expectation that the police would take all other steps reasonably available</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to them to prevent the recurrence of the crime. In part that was achieved by mounting the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">high profile prosecution of Glenn Mulcaire and Clive Goodman.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-35"><a href="#para6-35" name="para6-35">6.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Given the extent of the material in the Mulcaire archive and the collation of that material in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the blue book, one possible additional step would have been to alert senior management at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW and NI of their concern about the extent of the criminality so that the management</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could review their systems of corporate governance, possibly to institute their own internal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation into the relationship between the NoTW and Mr Mulcaire which had permitted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">him to earn so much money and, in the event that payments could not be justified to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">take such steps as they thought appropriate to deal with the position. It could have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained to NI that there were other leads in the material which they had seized which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could have revealed more widespread criminality but that were not being pursued because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of significant competing priorities to deal with counter terrorism. This is not to suggest that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the police should have undertaken any duty to monitor NI for which they had neither power</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nor resources.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-36"><a href="#para6-36" name="para6-36">6.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Taking this step might have led NI and NoTW to be rather less forceful in their assertion of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the line that Mr Goodman represented<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;one</span><span style="font-style:italic"> rogue</span><span style="font-style:italic"> reporter&#8221;</span> . Furthermore, when the police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">became aware that NI&#8217;s public approach was that Mr Goodman had been working alone,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the very least, the police should have been prepared to point to the observations of Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Perry, the conclusion of Mr Justice Gross and the fact that their investigation (necessarily not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken as far as it could have been taken because of counter terrorism) should not be taken as</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">supporting that conclusion. I am not suggesting that they could make allegations about those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whom they had not investigated; distancing the police from these conclusions, however,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would, at least, have provided some context.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-37"><a href="#para6-37" name="para6-37">6.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Surtees accepted that it would have been possible to go to NI and have a conversation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> may</span><span style="font-style:italic"> well</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> been</span><span style="font-style:italic"> viewed</span><span style="font-style:italic"> cynically&#8221;</span> . He agreed that if the police had done so,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then they could have pointed out, when reference was made to a single rogue reporter, that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the police<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;put</span><span style="font-style:italic"> them</span><span style="font-style:italic"> right&#8221;</span> because this did not do justice to the extent of the investigation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref353" href="#footnote353">353</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This would not have taken a great deal of police resource.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref354" href="#footnote354">354</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-6-38"><a href="#para6-38" name="para6-38">6.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This step did not, however, cross the mind of DCS Williams. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref355" href="#footnote355">355</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think to specifically do that. I &#8211; if I think of your question and look back, I feel</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we made it abundantly clear what our understanding was and what our suspicions</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were in terms of the requests that we made to them. I&#8217;m sure they were well aware</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of what it was that we suspected, and given that ultimately a member of their senior</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">management team resigned on the basis of what we&#8217;d found, I would have expected</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any senior management in an organisation to question why had that happened and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to understand exactly what had gone on.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-39"><a href="#para6-39" name="para6-39">6.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He went on to say that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref356" href="#footnote356">356</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Actually, I thought I&#8217;d already done that, had made it very clear, not just to them, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to any organisation that might be engaged in this, that might want to consider are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we also doing this.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;That was the whole purpose. It was to show people: if you are doing this, whoever</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you are and wherever you are, actually it is clearly criminally wrong, and you&#8217;ll go</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to prison, and if you&#8217;re an organisation that knows that you seek information and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">you should be thinking to yourselves, &#8216;I wonder if we&#8217;ve got any vulnerabilities?&#8217; &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that&#8217;s what we do as a learning organisation in the police. I don&#8217;t necessarily expect</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">someone to come and tell me that I should do that, and actually, I may be wrong, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I&#8217;m not aware in &#8211; either I&#8217;ve not done it and I&#8217;m not aware of my fellow investigators</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">having actually gone and this in senior companies. I know in frauds, then, but that&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more in terms of vulnerabilities of a system as opposed to actually something being</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wrong in the organisation. That&#8217;s usually demonstrated through the prosecution of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">people.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-6-40"><a href="#para6-40" name="para6-40">6.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams was right to expect the senior management at NI to conduct an internal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation and take such preventative measures as were necessary, but it was not safe to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assume that they would do so. Bearing in mind the &#8216;one rogue reporter&#8217; defence, the reverse</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was more likely to be the case. On any showing, by strongly advising that course of action, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was open to the police to maximise the chances that the issues would be addressed.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-41"><a href="#para6-41" name="para6-41">6.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The MPS argues that the omission to warn NI as to its future conduct was not a failing and that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it did all that was reasonable (given the relevant context and state of knowledge at the time)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to raise concerns with NI. The MPS submits that it was made<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;abundantly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> clear&#8221;</span> to NI that</span>




<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">the police suspected that voicemail interception was more widespread and that the message</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was delivered<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> firmly&#8221;</span> that they had a problem with employees engaged in<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;sustained</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">periods of criminal activity&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref357" href="#footnote357">357</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> The</span><span style="font-style:normal"> MPS</span><span style="font-style:normal"> submits</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> attempted</span><span style="font-style:normal"> search</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> NI</span><span style="font-style:normal"> would</span><span style="font-style:normal"> have</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sent a very clear message to NI that the MPS was seeking any evidence of criminality and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by implication a halt to any further criminal practice. Also, that the correspondence sent to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Burton Copeland demonstrated the attempts made by the MPS to bring to the attention of NI</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both the nature and extent of the documentation required and by implication the practice of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail interception within NoTW. In my judgment, however, these submissions overstate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the case: an aborted search that was not renewed and letters requesting documentation,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both of which entailed no repercussions for NI sent no warning signal at all.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-42"><a href="#para6-42" name="para6-42">6.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The MPS makes the further submission that it is evident from the recent arrests and various</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">charges in Operation Weeting that there is at least material for suggesting that others at NI</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">either knew or feared very much more extensive criminality. Without prejudicing the ongoing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal investigation and prosecution, it is not right to go further although it is sufficient to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">point to Mr Myler&#8217;s comment about<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;bombs</span><span style="font-style:italic"> under</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> newsroom</span><span style="font-style:italic"> floor&#8221;</span> as identifying his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concern which was hardly consistent with the stated line. In any event, this argument misses</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the point: what was important was not what the NoTW knew or appreciated but that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">police<span style="font-style:normal"> had</span><span style="font-style:normal"> strong</span><span style="font-style:normal"> grounds</span><span style="font-style:normal"> for</span><span style="font-style:normal"> believing</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> offending</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> more</span><span style="font-style:normal"> extensive</span><span style="font-style:normal"> than</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> public</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">line being deployed and that the fact that the investigation had not gone further should not</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">be taken as police endorsement of an attempt to minimise what had been uncovered.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-43"><a href="#para6-43" name="para6-43">6.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The MPS also relies on the prosecution itself, stating that this alone should have sent a very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clearmessagetoallmediaorganisations,notjustNI,thatvoicemailinterceptionwasillegaland</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would not be tolerated. I have no doubt that everyone understood the gravity of the position</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if it was detected. On the other hand, the deterrent effect of the prosecution would have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been substantially reduced by the fact that NI had arguably thwarted a wider investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by interfering with the searches in Wapping and by adopting the attitude reflected in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach of Burton Copeland to requests for information and documents. The deterrent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effect would also be reduced by the fact that, despite the indications of wider criminality at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NI, the investigation had been closed. In those circumstances, NI could well have considered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">itself &#8220;off the hook&#8221;. The matters relied upon by the MPS are simply not in the order of what,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in my judgment, was required of them before they put Operation Caryatid behind them.</span>

<p id="para-id-6-44"><a href="#para6-44" name="para6-44">6.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, the MPS argues that any approach by the MPS to NI in an unofficial capacity to seek</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">compliance could have been perceived by others as inappropriately &#8216;cosy&#8217; and DCS Williams</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has said that he was operating under the general instruction from Mr Clarke not to engage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the media. The MPS would not, however, be acting in an unofficial capacity and it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not correct to suggest that a formal approach by senior officers, at a fully documented and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">minuted meeting, delivering the warning and advice outlined above, could be perceived as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">overly &#8216;cosy&#8217; or otherwise inappropriate, or of a nature that Mr Clarke would prohibit.</span>

<h3>Change of editors</h3>

<p id="para-id-7-1"><a href="#para7-1" name="para7-1">7.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The one significant change that occurred at the NoTW following the prosecution was the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">resignation of Andy Coulson and appointment of Colin Myler as editor. Mr Coulson said in</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence that his resignation was his decision, reached without any prior discussion with Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch or Mr Hinton:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref358" href="#footnote358">358</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I went to see Les Hinton and I was very clear that I was going to resign, and then I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">did so.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-2"><a href="#para7-2" name="para7-2">7.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Accepting this evidence, which has not been contested in any way, the replacement of Mr</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">compensation for termination of employment.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref359" href="#footnote359">359</a></sup> This appears to suggest a gesture of good</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will on the part of NI to Mr Coulson at the point of his personal decision to accept editorial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibility for what had happened.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-3"><a href="#para7-3" name="para7-3">7.3</a></p>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">could not be put to the latter when he gave evidence in Module 1. Having been given the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opportunity to comment on Mr Murdoch&#8217;s account, Mr Myler contends that he was given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no such brief either in these somewhat colourful terms or otherwise, and that he simply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understood his role as being to edit the paper.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref361" href="#footnote361">361</a></sup> In response, Rupert Murdoch has clarified</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it certainly was his understanding from Les Hinton that Mr Myler was appointed to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> find</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">moved the paper forward by improving its practices and governance, to avoid a repetition of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the conduct which had led to the criminal convictions, without ascertaining what had gone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wrong in the past.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref362" href="#footnote362">362</a></sup> The upshot was that Mr Myler appears to have decided that his function</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be forward-looking:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref363" href="#footnote363">363</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; the trauma of what had happened with the Goodman/Mulcaire trial left a very</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deep, as I say, trauma within the newspaper and the morale of the staff. So I think it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was more important to improve the standards and the protocols and the systems that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">existed, rather than dwell on what was. I think it was more important to say, &#8216;From</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">now on, this is how we&#8217;re going to work and this is what it is&#8217;.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-4"><a href="#para7-4" name="para7-4">7.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Myler claimed, however, to be uneasy with the situation:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It&#8217;s fair to say that I always had some discomfort and I always &#8211; the term I phrased</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was I felt that there could have been bombs under the newsroom floor and I didn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know where they were and I didn&#8217;t know when they were going to go off. That was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my own view. But trying to get the evidence or establishing the evidence that sadly</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the police already had was another matter.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref364" href="#footnote364">364</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-5"><a href="#para7-5" name="para7-5">7.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There were steps that Mr Myler could have taken in an attempt to locate and defuse &#8216;the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bombs&#8217;. He had the ability to analyse every single payment to Mr Mulcaire and to require</span>







<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">every single journalist who had employed him to justify every single request or task that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire had been set and every story that Mulcaire had provided. Although in the light of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the way in which the paper had dealt with the police investigation, it may have been difficult</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or embarrassing, he could have sought the assistance of the police not to encourage further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation but to see whether there were any strands which they had considered which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an internal investigation might pursue thereby demonstrating his determination to root out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what had happened. Some of these steps might not have been practicable and the impact on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">morale had to be considered: but some must have been. In the event, he did little to assuage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his own &#8216;discomfort&#8217; except lay down rules for the future. As to the what had happened, he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">vigorously and forcefully followed a line which, to pursue the analogy of a bomb under the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newsroom floor, simply ignored his privately held fear of an impending explosion.</span>

<h3>The &#8220;one rogue reporter&#8221; claim</h3>
<h4>The PCC</h4>

<p id="para-id-7-6"><a href="#para7-6" name="para7-6">7.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Tim Toulmin, then Director of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) said that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PCC had neither the legal powers nor the authority vested in it by the newspaper industry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to institute an inquiry into other possible instances of unlawful voicemail interception at</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the NoTW or more generally in the press,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref365" href="#footnote365">365</a></sup> but that it wanted to do something useful to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complement the police inquiry so that light could be shone on what had gone wrong, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so that lessons could be learned to ensure that there was no repetition.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref366" href="#footnote366">366</a></sup> Accordingly, on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">7 February 2007, Mr Toulmin wrote to Mr Myler asking a number of questions about the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conduct of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire and asking him what the newspaper proposed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">do to ensure that the conduct was not repeated. In his reply, Mr Myler urged the PCC to see</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the episode in perspective on the basis that it represented:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref367" href="#footnote367">367</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;an exceptional and unhappy event in the 163 year history of the News of the World,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">involving one journalist&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-7"><a href="#para7-7" name="para7-7">7.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Myler also emphasised the newspaper&#8217;s commitment to the Code of Practice, drawing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">attention, by way of example, to an episode where it had dismissed a reporter for breaching</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the provisions of the Code. He said that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref368" href="#footnote368">368</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Every single News of the World journalist is conversant with the Code and appreciates</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fully the necessity of total compliance&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-8"><a href="#para7-8" name="para7-8">7.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Myler described Mr Goodman as a &#8220;rogue exception&#8221;. This is possibly the first use of what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">later became established as the &#8220;one rogue reporter&#8221; defence.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref369" href="#footnote369">369</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-9"><a href="#para7-9" name="para7-9">7.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Myler also set out the changes that he was making to prevent repetition of the conduct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerned. Those changes were: ensuring that contributors to the newspaper clearly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understood their responsibility to comply with the Code and NI policies and procedures;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ensuring that all journalists focussed on the importance of the Code and legal compliance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the risk of dismissal for failure to comply; and instituting processes to ensure that large</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cash sums could not be paid without appropriate authority.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref370" href="#footnote370">370</a></sup></span>






<!--new page--><p id="para-id-7-10"><a href="#para7-10" name="para7-10">7.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The PCC concluded that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref371" href="#footnote371">371</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;No evidence has emerged either from the legal proceedings or the Commission&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">questions to Mr Myler and Mr Hinton of a conspiracy at the newspaper going beyond</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Messrs Goodman and Mulcaire to subvert the law and the PCC&#8217;s Code of Practice.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There is no evidence to challenge Mr Myler&#8217;s assertion that: Goodman had deceived</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">hisemployerinordertoobtaincashtopayMulcaire;thathehadconcealedtheidentity</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the source of information on royal stories; and that no-one else at the News of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">World knew that Messrs Goodman and Mulcaire were tapping phone messages for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">stories. However, internal controls at the newspaper were clearly inadequate for the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">purpose of identifying the deception.&#8221;</span>
<h4>Parliament</h4>

<p id="para-id-7-11"><a href="#para7-11" name="para7-11">7.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On6March2007,LesHinton,ChairmanofNI,appearedinfrontoftheCultureMediaandSports</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Committee of the House of Commons (CMS Committee), which at that time was conducting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an inquiry into self-regulation of the press. Voicemail interception was only briefly touched</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on at the hearing. Mr Hinton told the Committee that a, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> full,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> rigorous</span><span style="font-style:italic"> internal</span><span style="font-style:italic"> inquiry</span> &#8221; was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being carried out and that he (Hinton) was absolutely convinced that Mr Goodman was the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">only person who knew what was going on.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref372" href="#footnote372">372</a></sup> The Committee noted this assurance without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">comment but were highly critical of the financial processes in place in NoTW that they had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been told allowed Mr Goodman to employ Mr Mulcaire to intercept voicemail messages</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">without appropriate oversight or authority from senior executives.</span>

<h3>Dismissal of Clive Goodman and his appeal</h3>

<p id="para-id-7-12"><a href="#para7-12" name="para7-12">7.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It appears that Mr Goodman expected to continue his employment at the NoTW once he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had served his sentence of imprisonment. In my judgment, that perception is, in itself, quite</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extraordinary. There can be few employees who would expect to return to their jobs after</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">serving a sentence of imprisonment for a serious criminal offence, particularly an offence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">committed in the course of their employment and, even more so, where (as was contended)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what he was doing was wholly unknown and had been managed and financed by deceit.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The NI Disciplinary Policy and Procedure provided for immediate dismissal without notice, or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">payment in lieu of notice, for various forms of &#8220;gross misconduct&#8221; including:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref373" href="#footnote373">373</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;conviction for a criminal offence (including outside of work) which may bring News</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">International into disrepute or otherwise impact on your suitability for employment</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with the Company&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-13"><a href="#para7-13" name="para7-13">7.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the circumstances Mr Goodman should properly have expected to be dismissed without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any form of financial compensation. However, Mr Goodman felt he had been given assurances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by both Tom Crone (the lawyer employed by NI who had ultimate legal responsibility for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">editorial legal matters at the NoTW) and Andy Coulson that he could return to work at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW once he had served his sentence providing he did not implicate in criminal conduct any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the newspaper&#8217;s other staff.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref374" href="#footnote374">374</a></sup> Whilst Mr Crone denied the allegation that there was any</span>




<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">suggestion that Mr Goodman might be kept on as the price for his silence, Mr Crone did say</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that Mr Coulson had indicated that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref375" href="#footnote375">375</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;he hoped that whatever happened to Clive Goodman at the end of the criminal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">process, and if he was found guilty and served his sentence, he would be able to come</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">back to the News of the World in some sort of role, having served his sentence. Not a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reporting role that involved interaction with the public in any other way, but perhaps</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">book filleting or book serialisation, possibly.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-14"><a href="#para7-14" name="para7-14">7.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the event, this view was not shared by Mr Hinton because on 5 February 2007 Mr Hinton</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wrote to Mr Goodman terminating his employment. The letter said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref376" href="#footnote376">376</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I recognise this episode followed many unblemished, and frequently distinguished,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">years of service to the News of the World. In view of this, and in recognition of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pressures on your family, it has been decided that upon your termination you will</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">receive one year&#8217;s salary. In all the circumstances, we would of course be entitled</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to make no payment whatever&#8230;You will be paid, through payroll, on 6 February</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2007, 12 months&#8217; base salary, subject to normal deductions of tax and nation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">insurance.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-15"><a href="#para7-15" name="para7-15">7.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The terms of the dismissal were considerably more generous than the terms of his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">employment required, but Mr Goodman was not content. On 2 March 2007, Mr Goodman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wrote to Daniel Cloke, then head of Human Resources at NI, appealing against his dismissal.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">His first two grounds of appeal were first, that the decision was perverse because his actions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were carried out with the full knowledge and support of executives at the NoTW and second,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the decision was inconsistent because others, who were still working for the NoTW, were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">engaged in the same illegal procedures.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref377" href="#footnote377">377</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-16"><a href="#para7-16" name="para7-16">7.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 14 March 2007, Mr Goodman submitted a lengthy list of documents which he wanted NI</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to provide for the purposes of his appeal. The list included emails passing between him and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">various named members of staff. On 9 May 2007 Jonathan Chapman, then Director of Legal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Affairs for NI, instructed solicitors, Harbottle & Lewis, to carry out a review of the emails</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identified by Mr Goodman. Mr Chapman sent formal instructions by email the following day</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Lawrence Abramson, then managing partner at Harbottle & Lewis, which stated that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref378" href="#footnote378">378</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Because of the bad publicity that could result in an allegation in an employment</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">tribunal that we had covered up potentially damaging evidence found on our email</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">trawl, I would ask that you &#8230; carry out an independent review of the emails in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">question and report back to me with any findings of material that could possibly tend</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to support either of Mr Goodman&#8217;s contentions&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-17"><a href="#para7-17" name="para7-17">7.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is revealing that the concern was to identify material that would cause the company further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">embarrassment or damage their prospects in an Employment Tribunal rather than ascertain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether the allegations made by Mr Goodman were true.</span>




<!--new page--><p id="para-id-7-18"><a href="#para7-18" name="para7-18">7.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 25 May 2007 Mr Abramson emailed Mr Chapman draft wording of his advice for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consideration by him before it was formalised.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref379" href="#footnote379">379</a></sup> The email read:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We have on your instructions searched the emails that you were able to let us have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">access to from the accounts of [redacted names] I can confirm that we did not find</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any evidence that proved that [redacted names] knew that Clive Goodman, Glenn</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire or any other journalists as the News of the World were engaged in illegal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">activities prior to their arrest.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-19"><a href="#para7-19" name="para7-19">7.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Later that day Mr Chapman suggested an addition to the advice, namely:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref380" href="#footnote380">380</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Equally, having seen a copy of Clive Goodman&#8217;s notice of appeal of 2 March 2007, we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">did not find anything that we consider to be directly relevant to the grounds of appeal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">put forward by him.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-20"><a href="#para7-20" name="para7-20">7.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Abramson declined to include this sentence because:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think the short answer is it wasn&#8217;t the exercise we&#8217;d been asked to conduct. We&#8217;d</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been asked to look for whether there was evidence in emails that supported specific</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">allegations, and to have then signed off on an opinion that was much wider than the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">exercise we&#8217;d been conducting would have been wholly wrong and I couldn&#8217;t have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">done that.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-21"><a href="#para7-21" name="para7-21">7.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The final wording was the following:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I can confirm that we did not find anything in those emails which appear to us to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reasonable evidence that Clive Goodman&#8217;s illegal activities were known about and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">supported &#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-22"><a href="#para7-22" name="para7-22">7.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is important to note the limited exercise that Harbottle and Lewis had been asked to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">carry out and the correspondingly limited comfort that NI could legitimately derive from it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when considering the broad question of whether there was evidence that the conspiracy to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intercept voicemail messages extended beyond Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire.</span>

<h3>The limits of the internal investigation</h3>

<p id="para-id-7-23"><a href="#para7-23" name="para7-23">7.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Despite the assurance given by Mr Hinton to the CMS Committee that a<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;full,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> rigorous</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">internal inquiry&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> being</span><span style="font-style:normal"> carried</span><span style="font-style:normal"> out,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> there</span><span style="font-style:normal"> is</span><span style="font-style:normal"> no</span><span style="font-style:normal"> evidence</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> anyone</span><span style="font-style:normal"> at</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> NoTW</span><span style="font-style:normal"> made</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any proper effort to investigate the veracity of the allegations made by Mr Goodman.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref381" href="#footnote381">381</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Apart from the review of the emails by Harbottle and Lewis, the internal investigation of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allegations made by Mr Goodman was limited to Mr Cloke and Mr Myler, speaking to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals named by Mr Goodman to ask whether there was any substance to them. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Myler said in his evidence that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref382" href="#footnote382">382</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;in the absence of any evidence to support Mr Goodman&#8217;s allegations they were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">denied. Very strongly.&#8221;</span>




<!--new page--><p id="para-id-7-24"><a href="#para7-24" name="para7-24">7.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Chapman said that the right thing to do was to investigate whether there was any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">foundation to the allegations.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref383" href="#footnote383">383</a></sup> However, Mr Myler and Mr Cloke appear to have accepted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at face value the denials of those individuals named by Mr Goodman. It does not appear that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">anyone at the title took seriously the possibility that the allegations were well-founded or,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given the very substantial sums that he had been paid, even investigated precisely what Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire had been doing and for whom he had been working.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-25"><a href="#para7-25" name="para7-25">7.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Crone said during his evidence that he had believed from the outset that the claim that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unlawful voicemail interception had been the action of &#8220;one rogue reporter&#8221; was wrong.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref384" href="#footnote384">384</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Crone had attended all the hearings at the Central Criminal Court, including the hearing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at which Goodman and Mr Mulcaire were sentenced. He had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8230;formed</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> strong</span><span style="font-style:italic"> impression</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that what was said about others at News International commissioning Mulcaire&#8217;s accessing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in relation to the non-royal victims was based upon more than circumstantial evidence<span style="font-style:normal"> .&#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref385" href="#footnote385">385</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Crone agreed during his evidence that one reason for forming that view was that counts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">16 to 20 did not relate to Royal issues and would therefore be outside Mr Goodman&#8217;s area of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interest.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref386" href="#footnote386">386</a></sup> When asked whether he had shared his view with others at NI that the &#8220;one rogue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reporter&#8221; claim was wrong he replied:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref387" href="#footnote387">387</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I had discussions which were privileged, yes. But I don&#8217;t think any of them involved</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">me saying there&#8217;s clear and hard evidence, to be perfectly honest.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-26"><a href="#para7-26" name="para7-26">7.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Crone explained that he took no other action because the police showed no signs of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">continuing the investigation or making more arrests and<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> company&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:italic"> primary</span><span style="font-style:italic"> thought</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Crone might have had he did nothing to change the view that Mr Myler had formed, namely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there was no evidence to justify an investigation into possible unlawful or unethical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">behaviour in the newsroom at the News of the World. Mr Myler explained that apart from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the investigations into the allegations made by Mr Goodman during his appeal against his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dismissal, he relied heavily on the fact that the police investigation had gone no further than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the charges against Mr Goodman and had not resulted in any suggestion by the police to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">News of the World that there was a wider problem.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref389" href="#footnote389">389</a></sup></span>

<h3>The Goodman and Mulcaire settlements</h3>

<p id="para-id-7-27"><a href="#para7-27" name="para7-27">7.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In July 2007 NI settled a claim for unfair dismissal brought by Mr Goodman, making a payment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of a further &#163;140,000 in addition to a &#163;90,000 notice payment that had been made in February</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2007 when Mr Goodman was dismissed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref390" href="#footnote390">390</a></sup> The focus in dealing with Mr Goodman&#8217;s claims</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was, according to Mr Chapman, to manage the risk of further reputational damage to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">company. The settlement agreement contained a confidentiality clause.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref391" href="#footnote391">391</a></sup></span>









<!--new page--><p id="para-id-7-28"><a href="#para7-28" name="para7-28">7.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The circumstances of Mr Goodman&#8217;s dismissal create an impression that his criminal conduct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was viewed not as an outrageous breach of the law, the Code and the company&#8217;s policies, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as something akin to a regrettable oversight in an old and trusted employee. The response</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the conviction and Mr Goodman&#8217;s allegations suggest that the possible widespread use of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">illegal methods of obtaining information was regarded, at the highest, as a reputational risk if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exposed. There is no sign that the News of the World regarded the fact that criminal conduct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may have flourished as a significant risk either from a corporate governance or operational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perspective. The potential underlying truth of the allegations was apparently regarded as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">second order issue.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-29"><a href="#para7-29" name="para7-29">7.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Running parallel with the dispute between NI and Mr Goodman was the similar dispute</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between NI and Mr Mulcaire, who was not an employee but who sought similar financial</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">recompense.InApril2007MrMulcaireclaimedthathiscontractwithNIgavehimemployment</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">rights and that NI had not followed the correct statutory procedures when it terminated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the contract in January 2007. The view was taken that there was a significant risk that an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">employment tribunal would find that Mr Mulcaire did have employment rights. Mr Chapman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained his analysis:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;WhenIanalysedtheposition,basedontheusualparameters,mutualityofobligation,</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">control, right of substitution, it looked very much to me like Mr Mulcaire was an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">employee, and I understand that subsequently Farrers took that view as well.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref392" href="#footnote392">392</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Mulcaire was paid approximately &#163;80,000.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref393" href="#footnote393">393</a></sup> Mr Chapman agreed that the reasoning</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">process that led to alighting upon a settlement figure for Mr Mulcaire was more or less the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">same as that which applied to Mr Goodman, namely the need to limit reputational harm.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref394" href="#footnote394">394</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-30"><a href="#para7-30" name="para7-30">7.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The approach of the company to severance payments or payments in lieu to Mr Goodman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Mr Mulcaire does not appear to convey corporate concern at their criminality; the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">payment to Mr Coulson<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref395" href="#footnote395">395</a></sup> may be considered slightly differently but is starkly in contrast to</span>

<h3>The Gordon Taylor litigation</h3>

<p id="para-id-7-31"><a href="#para7-31" name="para7-31">7.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The next significant event was the civil claim for damages brought by Gordon Taylor in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">spring of 2008. As Mr Crone, Mr Chapman and Mr Myler stated repeatedly in evidence, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">desire of the News of the World was to draw a line under the matter. As a result, the claim</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cannot have been well-received, not just because of the obvious financial implications, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also because of the potential reputational harm that would result even from only a repeat</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exposure of the facts of the prosecution of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-32"><a href="#para7-32" name="para7-32">7.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The claim was brought against NGN and Mr Mulcaire for breach of confidence, misuse of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">private information and breach of privacy. When Mr Taylor served his claim he provided</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no documentary evidence to support it and NGN filed a defence denying any involvement.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">However, Mr Taylor then applied for, and obtained, an order requiring the police to release</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the prosecution papers and evidence to his solicitors. Among those papers was the contract</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between Mr Mulcaire and the News of the World to pay Mr Mulcaire &#163;7,000 for information</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">briefing note on 24 May 2008 that this material was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> fatal</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> our</span><span style="font-style:italic"> case&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref398" href="#footnote398">398</a></sup> &#8220;Recognising the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inevitable&#8221;, Mr Crone instructed NGN&#8217;s solicitors, Farrer & Co, to make an offer to Mr Taylor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of &#163;150,000 plus costs.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-33"><a href="#para7-33" name="para7-33">7.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the light of the awards that had been made for breach of confidence and invasion of privacy,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this was a very substantial offer but Mark Lewis, of the solicitors instructed to pursue the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">claim, replied that Mr Taylor was not interested in settling and wanted to take the matter to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">trial. Mr Crone sought advice from Michael Silverleaf QC about how NGN should proceed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref399" href="#footnote399">399</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The advice from Mr Silverleaf, dated 3 June 2008, was very clear and echoed what Mr Crone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had already concluded. Mr Silverleaf concluded that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref400" href="#footnote400">400</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;NGN&#8217;s prospects of avoiding liability for the claims of breach of confidence and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">invasion of privacy&#8230;&#8230; are slim to the extent of being non-existent.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-34"><a href="#para7-34" name="para7-34">7.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He found it difficult to give clear advice on the level of damages that might be expected but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">put it within a range of &#163;25,000-&#163;250,000 or even slightly more.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref401" href="#footnote401">401</a></sup> In addition, Mr Silverleaf</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reflected on what the papers told him about the quality of the defence filed by the News of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the World, stating:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref402" href="#footnote402">402</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In the light of these facts, there is a powerful case that there is or was a culture of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">illegal information access used at NGN in order to produce stories for publication.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-35"><a href="#para7-35" name="para7-35">7.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Also on 3 June 2008 Julian Pike, a partner at Farrer & Co, told Mr Taylor&#8217;s solicitors that NGN</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was about to make an offer of &#163;350,000. He said that NGN were happy that this would not be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">beaten by the amount that might be awarded at trial, but that they were prepared to pay the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">higher amount in order to resolve the matter that week and on the basis that the deal would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be confidential.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref403" href="#footnote403">403</a></sup> Mr Pike then spoke to Mr Taylor&#8217;s solicitor, Mr Lewis, on 6 June 2008. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Lewis indicated that Mr Taylor would want at least &#163;1 million plus costs<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> open</span><span style="font-style:italic"> his</span></span>

<h3>Who knew what?</h3>

<p id="para-id-7-36"><a href="#para7-36" name="para7-36">7.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is not clear whether Mr Crone, who attended the Central Criminal Court, made any senior</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">executives aware of the key matters that indicated that the practice of unlawful voicemail</span>









<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">interception was not confined to Mr Goodman. Those matters were: the content of counts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">16 to 20 on the indictment; the fact that they were brought against Mr Mulcaire but not Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Goodman; the fact that they related to victims who were of no apparent interest to a royal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">correspondent and the sentencing remarks of Gross J. Mr Chapman said that he had obtained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a copy of the sentencing remarks at the request of Daniel Cloke, and on behalf of Mr Crone,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but that he did not read them himself.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref406" href="#footnote406">406</a></sup> Mr Myler claimed to be unaware of the sentencing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remarks.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref407" href="#footnote407">407</a></sup> There is no reason to doubt what Mr Myler says but, given the background and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his own perception of the newsroom, this lack of interest is also remarkable.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-37"><a href="#para7-37" name="para7-37">7.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In short, Mr Crone and Mr Chapman were both clearly aware of the allegations made by Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Goodman in his appeal against dismissal, but there is no evidence that they were known</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more widely. Mr Myler was also aware of them to the extent that they were demonstrated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the documents disclosed by the police for the purposes of the claim brought by Mr Taylor</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(these documents were also seen by Mr Crone).</span>

<p id="para-id-7-38"><a href="#para7-38" name="para7-38">7.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The extent of James Murdoch&#8217;s knowledge of the allegations is not clear. There was a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discussion between Mr Myler and James Murdoch of which neither participant claims to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have a substantial recollection. However, Mr Pike made a note of a subsequent telephone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conversation that he had with Mr Myler on 27 May 2008,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref408" href="#footnote408">408</a></sup> during which Mr Myler relayed to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Pike what he explained were the relevant points of his conversation with James Murdoch.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The note is not straightforward to interpret. It makes reference to the fact that Mr Goodman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> sprayed</span><span style="font-style:italic"> around</span><span style="font-style:italic"> allegations&#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref409" href="#footnote409">409</a></sup> but it is not clear whether that was a reference to what had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been discussed with James Murdoch or to the beginning of a subsequent discussion between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Myler and Mr Pike. James Murdoch contended that the note of his conversation with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Myler did not go beyond recording his view that they should wait for the opinion of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">leading Counsel, which had already been sought.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref410" href="#footnote410">410</a></sup> James Murdoch said in evidence that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Myler had not taken the opportunity to alert him to the fact that there were allegations that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail interception at the News of the World went wider than Mr Goodman.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref411" href="#footnote411">411</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-39"><a href="#para7-39" name="para7-39">7.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is also a dispute about how high within the organisation the advice from Mr Silverleaf</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was seen. There is no doubt that Mr Crone<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref412" href="#footnote412">412</a></sup> read it. Mr Myler said in evidence that he was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">told the gist of it but did not see the actual advice and was not told that Mr Silverleaf&#8217;s opinion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was that there was a<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;powerful</span><span style="font-style:italic"> case</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> there</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> or</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> culture</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> illegal</span><span style="font-style:italic"> information</span><span style="font-style:italic"> access</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">opinion of Mr Silverleaf was mentioned to him but not shown to him (which he explains is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not unusual as the Chief Executive), and that he was not told that there was new evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that NGN&#8217;s involvement in voicemail interception went beyond Mr Goodman.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref414" href="#footnote414">414</a></sup> What is</span>









<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">clear is that, even following the unequivocal opinion of Mr Silverleaf, no action was taken to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigate whether there was a culture of obtaining information by unlawful means. Instead,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the full focus of the management team was on handling the litigation and the potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reputational repercussions.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-40"><a href="#para7-40" name="para7-40">7.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 7 June 2008 Mr Myler forwarded an email chain to James Murdoch which made clear that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Taylor was asserting that unlawful information gathering techniques were<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;rife</span><span style="font-style:italic"> within</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Unfortunately it&#8217;sas bad as wefeared. The note from Julian Pike of Farrersis extremely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">telling regarding Taylor&#8217;s vindictiveness but again that speaks for itself. It would be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">helpful if Tom Crone and I could have five minutes with you on Tuesday.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-41"><a href="#para7-41" name="para7-41">7.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">James Murdoch explained in evidence that he did not read all the email chain, and did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">read the specific allegation made by Mr Taylor because he received the email on a Saturday</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">when he was with his family. He said that since he was due to meet Mr Myler to discuss the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue on the following Tuesday he did not feel he needed to read beyond the request for a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meeting.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref416" href="#footnote416">416</a></sup> James Murdoch replied to the email within two minutes of receiving it. The speed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and content of his reply appear to support his claim not to have focused on the key allegation.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-42"><a href="#para7-42" name="para7-42">7.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 10 June 2008, Mr Myler, Mr Crone and James Murdoch met to discuss the civil claim</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">brought by Mr Taylor. Mr Crone said in evidence that he probably took with him copies of Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Silverleaf&#8217;s opinion, the pleadings from the case, spare copies of the front page of the &#8220;for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Neville&#8221; email and his earlier briefing note.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref417" href="#footnote417">417</a></sup> Crone said that he could not recall whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any of these documents were handed to James Murdoch but that he was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;pretty</span><span style="font-style:italic"> sure&#8221;</span> that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he held up the front page of the &#8220;for Neville&#8221; email.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref418" href="#footnote418">418</a></sup> Mr Crone was very clear that the &#8220;for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Neville&#8221; email was discussed, and that James Murdoch was told that it was direct and hard</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence of involvement in voicemail interception beyond Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref419" href="#footnote419">419</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Myler said that he did not have any useful recollection of what specifically was discussed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the meeting or what documents were discussed or shared.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-43"><a href="#para7-43" name="para7-43">7.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">James Murdoch said in evidence that he was told at the meeting that there was evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that linked the interception of Mr Taylor&#8217;s voicemail messages to the NoTW and that the case</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would certainly be lost and should be settled. His recollection was that Mr Crone and Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Myler told him that counsel&#8217;s advice on the level of settlement was that: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> number</span><span style="font-style:italic"> could</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be upwards of &#8230; &#163;425,000, so they said half a million to a million pounds with costs in it<span style="font-style:normal"> .&#8221;</span></span>

<p id="para-id-7-44"><a href="#para7-44" name="para7-44">7.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">James Murdoch said that it was established at the meeting that it was better to settle at an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">amount that would avoid litigating a case that would be lost than<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;drag</span><span style="font-style:italic"> up</span><span style="font-style:italic"> all</span><span style="font-style:italic"> these</span><span style="font-style:italic"> things,</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;for Neville&#8221; email was limited to the fact that it linked the NoTW to the interception of Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Taylor&#8217;s voicemail messages and that there was no discussion about the fact that it suggested</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the involvement of other NoTW journalists. He said that he was not shown a copy of the</span>






<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">email<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref421" href="#footnote421">421</a></sup> or the opinion of Mr Silverleaf, nor told that the opinion of Mr Silverleaf was that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was evidence that the practice of voicemail interception was used by journalists other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than Mr Goodman.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref422" href="#footnote422">422</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-45"><a href="#para7-45" name="para7-45">7.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Given the significance of the issue, it is necessary also to deal with the extent to which Rupert</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch had knowledge of the relevant facts. Rupert Murdoch said in evidence that he knew</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nothing of the settlement of the claim brought by Mr Taylor when it happened in 2008. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said that he first learned of it in 2009 and was very surprised by the size of the settlement.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref423" href="#footnote423">423</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He recalled discussing with James Murdoch why the settlement was so high, but denied that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was any discussion about the fact that Mr Taylor had evidence of further illegality at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW or that NGN had had to settle at that level to buy the silence of Mr Taylor. He said that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">James Murdoch&#8217;s explanation for the value of the settlement was that, though high, it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">less than the anticipated cost of a full trial.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref424" href="#footnote424">424</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-7-46"><a href="#para7-46" name="para7-46">7.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rupert Murdoch claimed that senior management at NI:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref425" href="#footnote425">425</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;were, all misinformed and shielded from anything that was going on there...</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there&#8217;s no question in my mind that maybe even the editor, but certainly beyond that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">someone took charge of a cover-up which we were victim to&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-47"><a href="#para7-47" name="para7-47">7.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He went on to say that the culture of cover-up emanated from:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;one or two very strong characters &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;or the person I&#8217;m thinking of&#8230;..was a clever</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">lawyer and forbade people to go and report to Mrs Brooks or to James.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-48"><a href="#para7-48" name="para7-48">7.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both Mr Myler and Mr Crone strongly denied that there was a culture of cover up at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW. Mr Crone accepted that everyone hoped that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> would</span><span style="font-style:italic"> all</span><span style="font-style:italic"> go</span><span style="font-style:italic"> away&#8221;</span> if it could be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">kept quiet,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref426" href="#footnote426">426</a></sup> but contended that the thinking was not to cover up criminality but to avoid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reputational damage through bad publicity.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref427" href="#footnote427">427</a></sup> There is undoubtedly a fine line between the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">two. Mr Myler, similarly, said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref428" href="#footnote428">428</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it was a cover-up&#8230;.and I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s wrong or unreasonable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of any business to try to protect the reputation of itself, particularly after what had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">happened in the course of 2006 and 2007.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-7-49"><a href="#para7-49" name="para7-49">7.49</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whatever the truth of what was discussed on 10 June 2008, the evidence outlined above</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">points to a serious failure of governance within the NoTW, NI and News Corporation. There</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was a failure on the part of the management at the NoTW to take appropriate steps to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigate whether there was evidence of wrongdoing within the organisation. Although I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">endorse the right of any business to seek to protect its reputation, it surely must first take</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">every step to get to the bottom of what had happened. To argue that the decision by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police to conclude their<span style="font-style:italic"> criminal</span> investigations precluded the requirement for a proportionate</span>








<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">but robust<span style="font-style:italic"> internal</span> investigation is, in the circumstances, of real concern; and the attitude at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW to the police investigation equally meant that reliance could not be put on their having</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">done so. In any event, if the explanation of James and Rupert Murdoch is correct, far from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">simply limiting external damage to reputation, one or more parts of the management at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW was engaged in a determined cover-up to keep relevant information about potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal activity within the organisation from senior management within NI.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-50"><a href="#para7-50" name="para7-50">7.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Having made that point, however, I must make it clear that if James Murdoch was unaware</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the allegations, his lack of knowledge is, at least in part, only as a result of chance, rather</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than as the consequence of a sustained campaign by Mr Myler or Mr Crone (if there was one)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deliberately to keep him in the dark. The fact is that had he read, in detail, the entirety of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">email that he received on 7 June 2008, there was sufficient to put him onto a line of enquiry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which could have led to an investigation of the entire issue. It also depends on precisely what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he was told on 10 June 2008.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-51"><a href="#para7-51" name="para7-51">7.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is sufficient to say that if James Murdoch had been the victim of a cover-up, or an attempt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to minimise the gravity of the position, then the accountability and governance systems at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NI would have to be considered to have broken down in an extremely serious respect. If</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">James Murdoch was not the victim of an internal cover up then the same criticism can be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made of him as of Mr Myler or Mr Crone in respect of the failure to take appropriate action</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">to deal with allegations of widespread criminality within the organisation.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-52"><a href="#para7-52" name="para7-52">7.52</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">A similar analysis stands in respect of News Corporation. Although there is no evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from which I could safely infer that Rupert Murdoch was aware of a wider problem, it does</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not appear that he followed up (or arranged for his son to follow up) on the brief that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">believed had been given to Mr Myler to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> find</span><span style="font-style:italic"> out</span><span style="font-style:italic"> what</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hell</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> going</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span> &#8221;, leaving the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matter solely in the hands of Mr Hinton. If News Corporation management, and in particular</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rupert Murdoch, were aware of the allegations, it is obvious that action should have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken to investigate them. If News Corporation were not aware of the allegations which, as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Rupert Murdoch has said, have cost the corporation many hundreds of millions of pounds,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then there would appear to have been a significant failure in corporate governance and in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particular in the effective identification and management of risks affecting NI and, thus, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">corporation.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-53"><a href="#para7-53" name="para7-53">7.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have given careful consideration as to whether I should go further, and conclude that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Crone&#8217;s version of events as to what occurred on 10 June 2008 should be preferred to that of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">JamesMurdoch.ThereareaspectsoftheaccountofMrMurdochthatcausemesomeconcern:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in particular, it is surprising if the gist of Mr Silverleaf&#8217;s opinion was not communicated to him</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in circumstances where the potential reputational damage to the company, of which he was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">CEO, was likely to be great if an early settlement of the claim brought by Mr Taylor were not</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">achieved.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-54"><a href="#para7-54" name="para7-54">7.54</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, Mr Myler and Mr Crone had no reason or motive to conceal relevant facts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the senior man, as borne out by the former sending James Murdoch the chain of emails</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">containing the &#8216;bad news&#8217; on the afternoon of Saturday 7 June 2008. Not merely does this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">throw light on Mr Myler&#8217;s state of mind on that date, it provides some indication as to what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the agenda might have been for the meeting three days later. On the other hand, I also have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">serious concerns about the evidence of Mr Crone and Mr Myler about this meeting: given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the significance of the issue, it is surprising that there was not a full blown risk analysis with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">options for James Murdoch to consider. After all, this litigation represented the first of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">number of potential actions and there was, at the very least, a real risk that the problems were</span>
<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">likely to get worse as the other known victims (as represented by the criminal investigation if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">none other) could and doubtless would also pursue claims.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-55"><a href="#para7-55" name="para7-55">7.55</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is here that I must return to the Terms of Reference and to recognise that the detail of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who knew what is properly part of Part 2 of this Inquiry not least because of the ongoing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal investigation. Furthermore, the nature of the process of this part of the Inquiry has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meant that, in relation to these extremely fact sensitive meetings, there has been insufficient</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">opportunity for detailed cross examination of precisely what was said by whom to whom. In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the circumstances, I do not seek to reach any conclusion about precisely what transpired at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this meeting. For present purposes, it is sufficient to repeat that whoever&#8217;s account is correct</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as to what happened on 10 June 2008, there was no subsequent analysis of the consequences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to oversight and internal governance.</span>

<p id="para-id-7-56"><a href="#para7-56" name="para7-56">7.56</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In truth, at no stage, did anybody drill down into the facts to answer the myriad of questions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that could have been asked and which could be encompassed by the all embracing question</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;what the hell was going on<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;?</span><span style="font-style:normal"> These</span><span style="font-style:normal"> questions</span><span style="font-style:normal"> included</span><span style="font-style:normal"> what</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Mulcaire</span><span style="font-style:normal"> had</span><span style="font-style:normal"> been</span><span style="font-style:normal"> doing</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for such rewards and for whom?; what oversight had been exercised in relation to the use of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his services?; why had Mr Goodman felt it justifiable to involve himself in phone hacking?;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">why had he argued that he should be able to return to employment and why was he being (or</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">why had been) paid off. On any showing, these questions were there to be asked and simple</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">denials should not have been considered sufficient. This suggests a cover up by somebody</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and at more than one level. Although this conclusion might be parsimonious, it is more than</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficient to throw clear light on the culture, practices and ethics existing and operating at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the News of the World at the material time. The way in which further litigation was managed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(including the action brought by Max Clifford) only serves to underline the same issue both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justifying and reinforcing the same conclusion.</span>

<h2>8. July 2009: The Guardian</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p id="para-id-8-1"><a href="#para8-1" name="para8-1">8.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although the NoTW was having to cope with the consequences of Operation Caryatid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both in relation to Clive Goodman, Glenn Mulcaire, Andy Coulson and all those who then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wished to pursue claims for damages, in the immediate aftermath of the prosecution</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and notwithstanding what journalists knew, believed or had gossiped about in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail interception, until the Guardian article, there is no evidence that the wider issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(or the police investigation) was considered in any detail by the press. When the Guardian</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(and, subsequently, the New York Times) did publish articles, both the Police and the PCC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reacted. They did so, however, in ways that have raised more questions than they answered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, in the context of this Part of the Inquiry, require detailed consideration.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-2"><a href="#para8-2" name="para8-2">8.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">More specifically, this Inquiry must address the public concern about the decisions taken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the MPS in 2009 and 2010 to the effect that there was nothing in what was reported in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press to justify further examination despite the claim that the MPS itself held evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that implicated other journalists and which would merit further investigation. In particular, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">boils down to the question whether any relationship between the MPS and NI, or between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">officers within the MPS and senior management in NI influenced the decisions which were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then made.</span>
<!--new page--><p id="para-id-8-3"><a href="#para8-3" name="para8-3">8.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">To address that issue, the focus of this section is upon the reasons why, until January 2011, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MPS, and the then Assistant Commissioner, John Yates, in particular, asserted and maintained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the position that there was no evidence of further criminality and that absent &#8220;new evidence&#8221;,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was no reason to re-open the 2006 investigation, despite the facts, first, that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">detectives involved in Operation Caryatid knew that there was evidence implicating other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists, but which had not been taken further in 2006 because of resource constraints</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and, second, that the police held vast quantities of material that had not been fully analysed</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">in 2006.</span>

<h3>The allegations made by the Guardian</h3>

<p id="para-id-8-4"><a href="#para8-4" name="para8-4">8.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 8 and 9 July 2009 the Guardian published an article<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref429" href="#footnote429">429</a></sup> which exposed that NGN had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">paid out more than &#163;1 million to settle claims for the reason that the claims threatened to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reveal evidence of its journalists&#8217; repeated involvement in the use of criminal methods to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obtain stories. Those criminal methods were alleged to include using private investigators to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intercept the mobile phone voicemail messages of numerous public figures, including cabinet</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ministers, MPs, actors and sportspeople. The article referred specifically to the claim brought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by Gordon Taylor and stated:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Today, the Guardian reveals details of the suppressed evidence which may open the</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">door to hundreds more legal actions by victims of News Group, the Murdoch company</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that publishes the News of the World and the Sun, as well as provoking police inquiries</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">into reporters who were involved and the senior executives responsible for them.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-5"><a href="#para8-5" name="para8-5">8.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The article claimed that the evidence posed difficult questions for Andy Coulson, Rupert</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Murdoch executives and, in addition:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) the MPS<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;who</span><span style="font-style:italic"> did</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> alert</span><span style="font-style:italic"> all</span><span style="font-style:italic"> those</span><span style="font-style:italic"> whose</span><span style="font-style:italic"> phones</span><span style="font-style:italic"> were</span><span style="font-style:italic"> targeted&#8221;</span> ;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-6"><a href="#para8-6" name="para8-6">8.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The article referred to the assertion of NI, following the prosecution of Mr Goodman and Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire, that it knew of no other journalist who was involved in voicemail interception and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that Mr Goodman had been acting without its knowledge. The article then went on:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;However, one senior source at the Met. police told the Guardian that during the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Goodman inquiry, officers had found evidence of News Group staff using private</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigators who hacked into &#8220;thousands&#8221; of mobile phones. Another source with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">direct knowledge of the police findings put the figure at &#8220;two or three thousand&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mobiles. They suggest that MPs from all three parties and cabinet ministers, including</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">former deputy prime minister John Prescott and former culture secretary Tessa Jowell,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were among the targets &#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-7"><a href="#para8-7" name="para8-7">8.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The article referred to the fact that in the claim brought by Mr Taylor, the court had ordered</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the MPS to disclose evidence obtained during its investigation into Mr Goodman and then</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reported as follows:</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Scotland Yard files included paperwork which revealed that, contrary to News</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Group&#8217;s initial denial, Mulcaire had provided a recording of the messages on Taylor&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">phone to a News of the World journalist who had transcribed them and emailed them</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to a senior reporter; and that a News of the World executive had offered Mulcaire</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a substantial bonus payment for a story specifically related to the intercepted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">messages.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-8"><a href="#para8-8" name="para8-8">8.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The article also reported that, faced with this evidence, NI began offering huge sums of money</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Mr Taylor to settle the case and secure a confidentiality clause. It continued:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Scotland Yard paperwork also provided evidence that the News of the World</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had been involved with Glenn Mulcaire in his hacking the mobile phones of at least</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">two other figures from the world of football. They, too, filed complaints, which were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">settled earlier this year when News International paid a total of more than &#163;300,000</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in damages and costs on condition that they, too, signed gagging clauses.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The Guardian&#8217;s understanding is that the paperwork disclosed by Scotland Yard</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to Taylor is only a fraction of the total material they gathered on News Group&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">involvement with Glenn Mulcaire.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-9"><a href="#para8-9" name="para8-9">8.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Guardian had made a clear allegation that evidence implicating journalists other than Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Goodman had already been obtained by the police during the original investigation. It was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not the case that the Guardian was alleging that it had uncovered evidence that the police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had not been able to obtain themselves.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-10"><a href="#para8-10" name="para8-10">8.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The article prompted a number of responses which bear detailed examination although</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the response from NI itself can be dealt with shortly. The evidence of James Murdoch was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the article was drawn to his attention and that he asked the management at the NoTW</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether the allegation, that Mr Taylor had been paid, in effect, &#8220;hush money&#8221;, was true. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said that he was assured:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref430" href="#footnote430">430</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;That it wasn&#8217;t true, that there was no other evidence, that there &#8211; you know, this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is a &#8211; you know, this has been investigated to death and this is, you know, a smear.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-11"><a href="#para8-11" name="para8-11">8.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He made no effort to probe further and accordingly there was no investigation of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allegations.</span>

<h3>The police response</h3>

<p id="para-id-8-12"><a href="#para8-12" name="para8-12">8.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the morning of 9 July 2009, which was the day after the Guardian article appeared</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">online but when it featured in the print edition of the newspaper, the Metropolitan Police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, was being driven to an ACPO conference. It was quite</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">frequently the case that he would hear something on the radio or read something in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">newspaper and ask the matter to be looked into and he heard a discussion on the radio</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the allegations made in the article. Sir Paul understood the allegation to be that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MPS had not<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;gone</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> whole</span><span style="font-style:italic"> distance&#8221;</span> in the investigation. He took it to be<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;just</span><span style="font-style:italic"> yet</span><span style="font-style:italic"> another</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">headline&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> which</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> expected</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Assistant</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Commissioner</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> pick</span><span style="font-style:normal"> up</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> deal</span><span style="font-style:normal"> with.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref431" href="#footnote431">431</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> In</span><span style="font-style:normal"> this</span></span>


<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">case, by reason of his responsibility, John Yates was the natural choice: by then, Mr Yates had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">succeeded Andy Hayman as the Assistant Commissioner in charge of Specialist Operations.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref432" href="#footnote432">432</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-13"><a href="#para8-13" name="para8-13">8.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Paul telephoned Mr Yates. Sir Paul and Mr Yates had the common understanding that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Yates was not expected to conduct a &#8220;review&#8221; of Operation Caryatid but to &#8220;establish the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">facts&#8221; surrounding the investigation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref433" href="#footnote433">433</a></sup> As Mr Yates stressed:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref434" href="#footnote434">434</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The request was to &#8216;establish the facts&#8217;. There has been some misunderstanding and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">debate about the term &#8216;review&#8217; &#8211; a review in police terms is a comprehensive piece of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">work which involves a substantial number of people reviewing an entire investigation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or particular aspects of one &#8230; Reviews are resource intensive and there has to be a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">compelling reason for a decision to devote staff and officers to undertake one. New</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">evidence or new information could obviously be a compelling reason, although it is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">likely that a scoping exercise would be carried out first to decide whether such a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decision was merited. The article of 9 July 2009 provided no such new evidence or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">new information that merited a full review.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-14"><a href="#para8-14" name="para8-14">8.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">An issue that arises immediately is whether it was appropriate for Mr Yates to conduct the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exercise at all given the nature of his relationship with Neil Wallis.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref435" href="#footnote435">435</a></sup> This was significant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because, according to the Guardian, there appeared to be a conspiracy involving reporters at</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the NoTW which possibly encompassed senior executives responsible for reporters. Needless</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to say Mr Wallis, as deputy editor of the NoTW, was someone who on the face of things fell</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">within this latter category and there was therefore a risk that far from assuaging concern,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should the nature of his friendship become public knowledge, Mr Yates would exacerbate it.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-15"><a href="#para8-15" name="para8-15">8.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Police action should always be capable of withstanding the test of public scrutiny and both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the independence of decision-making and the appearance of the same are vital to this.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whilst there is no evidence to cause me to suspect that Mr Yates was, in fact, influenced</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in his decision-making by his friendship with Mr Wallis, I have no doubt that he should not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have accepted the task nor maintained responsibility for considering subsequent allegations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made in the press; particularly (as was the event), if he was to dismiss the concern, he risked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">creating a perception that the decision-making of the MPS was not independent or impartial,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but influenced by his friendship.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-16"><a href="#para8-16" name="para8-16">8.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In response to the suggestion that he should not have undertaken the fact-finding exercise in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the light of his relationship with Mr Wallis, Mr Yates said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref436" href="#footnote436">436</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; from 2005, 2006 onwards, whenever Caryatid started, there was never any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">question of Mr Wallis being involved. He hadn&#8217;t resigned, he continued to work at the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspaper. There was no evidence in July 2009 &#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;... So as far as we were aware, you had Mr Goodman, as a cog in a large organisation,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">arrested for wrongdoing and sent to prison. That, as far as I was aware at the time</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and others were aware, no other evidence to suggest others&#8217; involvement, does that</span>





<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mean you cut off relationships with a very influential section of the media? I don&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think it does.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-17"><a href="#para8-17" name="para8-17">8.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Leaving aside for the time being the misconception that there was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;no</span><span style="font-style:italic"> other</span><span style="font-style:italic"> evidence</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">state that there was no evidence to suggest that Mr Wallis was involved in unlawful voicemail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interception because the Guardian was claiming precisely that senior executives could be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involved and that there was evidence that they were. On analysis, this response betrays a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">closed mind-set because it suggests that Mr Yates had already dismissed the very question</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he was being asked to consider, even if on a limited basis: namely whether the police held</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence of a conspiracy to intercept communications that went beyond Mr Goodman and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Mulcaire and which they should now be considering. Further, in this answer Mr Yates did</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not grapple with the fact that his friendship with Mr Wallis might create a perception that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be influenced in his decision-making. When challenged about the perception created</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref437" href="#footnote437">437</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;No, I take &#8211; of course I take your point, but I think the benefit of hindsight once again</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">comes into play because in July 2009 there was nothing to suggest that Wallis was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">involved in any way whatsoever, and what&#8217;s happened in the last few years, and of</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">course nothing has been proven yet, but in July 2009 there was just &#8211; there was no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">indication at all, and I did this very dispassionately, and I take your point about the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">perception, but it didn&#8217;t appear to me to be a problem then and it didn&#8217;t appear to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">others to be a problem then. It is clearly a problem now.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-18"><a href="#para8-18" name="para8-18">8.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Yates continued:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref438" href="#footnote438">438</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I completely take that as a perception, but what this was on July 9, 2009, was a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspaper article. It didn&#8217;t present evidence. Newspaper articles, as we all know,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">can have basis in facts and they can have lots of flour put around them to make them</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more interesting. I can only go on what the evidence was that day and that&#8217;s where</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I got to.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-19"><a href="#para8-19" name="para8-19">8.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In those answers Mr Yates failed to deal with the fundamental point that it could be perceived</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he did not approach the exercise with a wholly objective mindset. He also appeared</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not to grasp that it mattered not at all whether he was aware of any evidence implicating</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Wallis personally, not least because before he embarked on the fact-finding exercise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he had no way of knowing what evidence Operation Caryatid had uncovered or what the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">alleged<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;suppressed</span><span style="font-style:italic"> evidence&#8221;</span> comprised. Finally, after a number of questions on the point,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he appeared to accept that there was at least the appearance of a lack of disinterestedness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because of his close friendship with Mr Wallis,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref439" href="#footnote439">439</a></sup> although he has since made clear that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">denies that it was a misjudgement to undertake the exercise and that he does not accept even</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there was a perception that the decision-making for which he was ultimately responsible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not independent and impartial.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-20"><a href="#para8-20" name="para8-20">8.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Yates has also since argued that had the fact-finding exercise uncovered any hint of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potential wrongdoing by Neil Wallis personally, then he would at that point have declared a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conflict of interest and handed the exercise over to a colleague. I have no doubt that this is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">correct, but it does not address the fundamental concern that the general allegation in the</span>



<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">Guardian and the circumstances could almost inevitably create concern that he might not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach the evidence with sufficient objectivity and independence of mind.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-21"><a href="#para8-21" name="para8-21">8.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">During his evidence Mr Yates was understandably eager to stress that in reality his friendship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Mr Wallis had no bearing on his decision-making. He sought to reinforce this by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">emphasising that there were<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;informal</span><span style="font-style:italic"> checks</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> balances&#8221;.</span> Mr Yates gave the example</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it would be nonsense to suggest that an officer like DCS Surtees would accept a perverse</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision just because Mr Yates was a senior officer.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref440" href="#footnote440">440</a></sup> Whilst factors such as these support my</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclusion that the decision-making of Mr Yates was not in fact distorted by his friendship</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Mr Wallis, they would not have prevented the perception forming that it was, and that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perception is capable of undermining public confidence in his decision.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-22"><a href="#para8-22" name="para8-22">8.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Yates suggested that it could only be said that his decision to undertake the fact-finding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exercise was wrong when viewed with hindsight, informed by knowledge of<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> cover-up</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">undertaken by News International&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><span style="font-style:normal"> I</span><span style="font-style:normal"> simply</span><span style="font-style:normal"> do</span><span style="font-style:normal"> not</span><span style="font-style:normal"> accept</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> argument:</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> my</span><span style="font-style:normal"> judgment,</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the facts that made it inappropriate for him to look into the allegations made by the Guardian</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">wereknownatthetime.IalsoobservethatthepositionofMrYateswasinternallyinconsistent.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On the one hand his thinking was to the effect that &#8220;this is nothing, we do this all the time, it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is no big deal&#8221;; but on the other hand, he clearly thought it was sufficiently important that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should deal with it himself and that it was necessary for an Assistant Commissioner to &#8216;front&#8217;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the consideration of the article and, very quickly, to speak to the press about it. There was no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question of delegating the task.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-23"><a href="#para8-23" name="para8-23">8.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If it was sufficiently important for him to deal with, he ought to have raised with the Deputy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner, Tim Godwin, or Sir Paul Stephenson whether it would be better if someone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">else undertake the exercise because the deputy editor of the NoTW was his friend. I conclude</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this discussion by making clear that I do not suggest that, in reality, he approached the task</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with anything other than complete integrity and in good faith. Having said that, accepting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and retaining the task was, at the time, a misjudgement on his part.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-24"><a href="#para8-24" name="para8-24">8.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Paul believes that Mr Yates did not give thought to whether there was a conflict of interest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because of a defensive mindset:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref441" href="#footnote441">441</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I suspect that defensive mindset set in very early, for all the reasons I outline, that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">stopped us challenging ourselves, that stopped us going back and challenging what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was the reason for the original investigation stopping short, albeit we didn&#8217;t know it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">stopped short. I think that is the more likely reason why Mr Yates didn&#8217;t decide that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he had a conflict or not.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-25"><a href="#para8-25" name="para8-25">8.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is certainly a plausible explanation. Fully articulated (as put by Mr Rhodri Davies QC in his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">closing address for NI) it is that Mr Yates (and indeed DCS Williams) did not interpret the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Guardian&#8217;s article as a non-judgmental suggestion that the practice of voicemail interception</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">merited another look. Rather, he saw it as an unjustified attack on the integrity of the 2006</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation that it did not occur to him to consider whether it was appropriate for him</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to carry out the exercise. In addition, this latter question did not subsequently strike him</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because he made up his mind within the space of what can only have been a few hours that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was no need to look further and that there was no evidence of a conspiracy, least of all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one involving Mr Wallis.</span>


<!--new page--><p id="para-id-8-26"><a href="#para8-26" name="para8-26">8.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is right that Sir Paul knew that Mr Yates was a friend of Mr Wallis (although he said that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did not know the extent of the friendship).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref442" href="#footnote442">442</a></sup> Sir Paul very frankly admitted that he did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">make the connection. When it was suggested to him that it might have been inappropriate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for Mr Yates carry out the exercise, he said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref443" href="#footnote443">443</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think you&#8217;re crediting me with a level of analysis that I wouldn&#8217;t and didn&#8217;t give</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to this matter. It was just another headline, a sort of &#8211; I don&#8217;t mean to say this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">dismissively &#8211; some noise about an event that I expected someone to pick up and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deal with &#8230; I didn&#8217;t connect it with Mr Wallis. I didn&#8217;t give it any particular thought.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-27"><a href="#para8-27" name="para8-27">8.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It does not seem, however, that Sir Paul would have acted differently even if he had made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the connection between Mr Wallis and the allegations made by the Guardian. Sir Paul said in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref444" href="#footnote444">444</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Had [Mr Yates] come back to me with this &#8230; I might have expected him to get</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">somebody within his business group to deal with it and ensure there could be no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">allegations of impropriety against him. I do have to say &#8211; this is hypothesis and we&#8217;re</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">speculating just a little, sir &#8211; that probably Mr Yates would have felt that he was more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">than equipped to deal with it. It is not as if, in our professional lives, that we don&#8217;t</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">actually, as chief constables and senior officers, investigate people who are known to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">us socially and who have been friends, and to actually say somebody else has to deal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with it would almost be saying that I do not have sufficient integrity to deal with it.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Whether, with hindsight, it might have been wise to do that, I think that&#8217;s an entirely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">different question. I can understand why he didn&#8217;t do it, but with hindsight it might</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">have been wise.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-28"><a href="#para8-28" name="para8-28">8.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Paul was challenged on his evidence that chief constables and senior officers investigate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">people known to them socially and who have been friends. He clarified his evidence as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref445" href="#footnote445">445</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, as a police officer, when I&#8217;ve been asked to do discipline and complaints in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">past going back years, yes, I&#8217;ve investigated people who have been known to me.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-29"><a href="#para8-29" name="para8-29">8.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This clarification, in fact, answers a different question to that being addressed. When</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dealing with complaints against the police and internal discipline issues it is inevitable (and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particularly so in a small force) that officers will have to deal with colleagues who are known</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to them. That is very different from leading or taking part in the investigation of civilians who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are personal friends (or, I might add, investigating organisations in which personal friends</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hold leadership responsibilities). There are strict rules about conflicts of interest of this type</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(including the maintenance of relationships with those who are under investigation) and I do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not anticipate for one moment that Sir Paul was distancing himself from those rules.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref446" href="#footnote446">446</a></sup></span>





<!--new page--><h3>The &#8220;fact-finding&#8221; exercise</h3>

<p id="para-id-8-30"><a href="#para8-30" name="para8-30">8.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I turn now to the exercise that was conducted to find the facts, which Mr Yates started and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on which he announced his conclusion all within the same day as the article had appeared in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">print, namely 9 July 2009.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-31"><a href="#para8-31" name="para8-31">8.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Yates explained that he received informal briefings about the investigation before he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">chaired a Gold Group meeting at 11:00hrs: this was a formal meeting to discuss facts and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">record decisions. Mr Yates said that numerous people who had worked on the enquiry at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">various levels were involved, including DCS Williams, DCS Surtees and D/Supt Southworth.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref447" href="#footnote447">447</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">According to DCS Williams, he was with Mr Yates for most of the day, explaining to him what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the police had done during the original investigation. The documents shown to Mr Yates were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the strategy for informing potential victims, a copy of the indictment and a short briefing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">document.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref448" href="#footnote448">448</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-32"><a href="#para8-32" name="para8-32">8.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There were three problems with the process that was adopted on that day. The first and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fundamental problem was that none of the officers, including DCS Williams, who had overall</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibility for briefing Mr Yates, were given any real opportunity to refresh their memory</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the nuances of what had been a comparatively complex investigation, involving seizure of a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">vast quantity of material, difficult issues of law and the overwhelmingly important competing</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">demands consequent upon the threat of terrorism. Mr Yates did not wait for the documents</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(including the decision log) to be retrieved from storage, leaving DCS Williams with access</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only to the memories of the officers available to discuss the investigation and to very limited</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">documentation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref449" href="#footnote449">449</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-33"><a href="#para8-33" name="para8-33">8.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Yates has submitted that before he reached any conclusions he ensured that DCS Williams</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and senior members of his team had satisfied him that they had a full recollection of all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">salient points of the investigation. It was, however, quite unrealistic of Mr Yates to expect that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the officers could do so in such a short time, even if they believed they could. This briefing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was about the material discovered, the actions taken and the decisions made just short</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of three years beforehand, when there can be no doubt that the officers had since been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involved in extremely complex counter terrorism investigations. They could not conceivably</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have remembered all the detail, let alone appreciate that what they had intended to happen</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by way of exit strategy had not been followed through.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-34"><a href="#para8-34" name="para8-34">8.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The minutes of the Gold Group meeting<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref450" href="#footnote450">450</a></sup> indicate that Mr Yates approached the task by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">asking some perceptive questions. These included the question:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Why</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> there</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> more</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wide ranging investigation?&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> According</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> minutes,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> told</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> reason</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that:</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There was no evidence to expand the investigation wider, which, if it had done, then this</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">who gave these answers and communicated this message to Mr Yates because it appears</span>




<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">that he was the only officer present at the Gold Group meeting who would have had any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">knowledge of the detail of the investigation.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-35"><a href="#para8-35" name="para8-35">8.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Leaving aside the question of whether the evidence uncovered by Operation Caryatid ought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">properly to be labelled as direct, circumstantial or inferential evidence, it is important to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">note from the outset that the message communicated to Mr Yates was not that there was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;some evidence&#8221; that the criminality extended beyond Mr Goodman, but that there had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been insufficient evidence to prosecute other journalists (which, as I have found, was the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understanding, in 2006,of the officers involved in Operation Caryatid, including DCS Williams).</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Instead, it appears that in the mind of DCS Williams on 9 July 2009, that understanding had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">become a belief that, although there had been plenty of speculation that other journalists</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been involved, the sum total of the evidence uncovered by Operation Caryatid was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">capable of being taken forward or developed as part of a wider investigation. It is quite likely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this initial briefing provided the prism through which Mr Yates viewed the information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he was given in subsequent oral and written briefings.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-36"><a href="#para8-36" name="para8-36">8.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I consider that the answers given by DCS Williams did not accurately reflect not only the value</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the material that the police had seized but also the way in which the investigation had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been brought to an end. Given the haste with which this &#8220;fact-finding exercise&#8221; was being</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">undertaken, however, it is difficult to be over-critical of DCS Williams at this stage.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-37"><a href="#para8-37" name="para8-37">8.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When he came to make a statement in September 2011, DCS Williams had obviously had the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">chance of reviewing the contemporaneous material in detail and so was able to deal with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matter rather more reflectively and in greater detail than would ever have been possible in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">July 2009. The contrast is obvious. The more recent explanation provides the context in these</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref451" href="#footnote451">451</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In the months following the arrest and right up to the prosecution &#8230; DAC Clarke&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decision to continue within the parameters as originally set and thereby not go any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">further in terms of the material seized from Mulcaire and Goodman, remained.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">My understanding of this enduring rationale was that this would have involved a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">commitmentofhugeresourcesthatcouldnotbejustifiedgiventheclimateconcerning,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in particular, terrorism. On balance it was felt that the safety of the public was more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">important that protecting invasions of privacy; and that it was not the job of police to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">regulate the media, rather that it should regulate itself through the PCC.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-38"><a href="#para8-38" name="para8-38">8.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The differences are important. To say, for example, that there was no evidence to implicate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other journalists (which, in any event, although the expressed view of DCS Williams did not,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in my judgment, start to be an accurate analysis of the material available to the police),</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is not the same as saying that the decision not to go further was based on the resource</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commitment involved. It is worth adding, in parenthesis, that even if Mr Yates had waited for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the records to be unearthed, he would not have found a record of the briefing given to Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Clarke at the end of September 2006 or of the rationale behind the ultimate decision not to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">expand the investigation beyond Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire because there was no such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">record. A careful study of the decision log, the statements and interviews (which contained,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for example, the references to other possible victims) would, however, have revealed a rather</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">different picture to that which he had been given during the briefing.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-39"><a href="#para8-39" name="para8-39">8.39</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In relation to the absence of the record, the MPS submits that although the specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasons were not set out in any detail, given the successful and widely reported charging</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and subsequent public prosecutions of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire together with the</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">formulation of a victim strategy:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> should</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> been</span><span style="font-style:italic"> evident</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> anyone</span><span style="font-style:italic"> subsequently</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reviewing the decision that it was not made on the basis that there were no further leads</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecution and the strategy say nothing about whether there existed viable investigative</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">leads when the decision was made to close down the investigation.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-40"><a href="#para8-40" name="para8-40">8.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The MPS also submits that the lack of recorded reasons did not have any material impact on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the 2009 decision, as the same officers who conducted the original investigation also provided</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">detailed briefings and advised Mr Yates. Although true, the fact is that neither DCS Williams</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nor any other officer who spoke to Mr Yates on 9 July did, apparently, recall accurately why</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the decision was made by Mr Clarke and so did not provide a full picture for Mr Yates.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref452" href="#footnote452">452</a></sup> If</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what records there were had been available, rather more detail might have come back to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mind. I understand the reasons but it reveals an important flaw in what was happening on</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">that day.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-41"><a href="#para8-41" name="para8-41">8.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams has submitted that although the final decision not to expand the investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not recorded, the decision log had considered the question of expanding the investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the issue of resources and that the final decision was part of that ongoing decision making</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">process. He goes on to argue that Mr Yates knew why the operation had been closed down,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but I have seen no evidence that Mr Yates was ever told, in terms which would have been</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficiently clear to correct the initial understanding he was given (that there was no evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to expand the investigation wider), that Mr Clarke made the decision essentially on the basis</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the necessary prioritisation of counter terrorism investigations so that his decision said</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">little if anything about the quality of the evidence or viability of the leads. The fact remains</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the rationale was not explained adequately to Mr Yates and a clearly recorded decision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">setting out the rationale would, in all likelihood, have avoided the misunderstanding that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">clearly arose. Suffice to say, I have little doubt that the answers given on 9 July to the questions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">posed by Mr Yates caused him to misunderstand the scope of what had been revealed during</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Caryatid and to go on to approach the exercise from entirely the wrong angle, that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is to say focusing exclusively on the question of whether the Guardian article had revealed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any evidence that the police had not previously seen.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-42"><a href="#para8-42" name="para8-42">8.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second problem was that Mr Yates did not approach the exercise with any intellectual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rigour or scrutinise the information he was given. As explained above, crucially, Mr Yates</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pursued only the question whether anything was new: he did not pursue the questions which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the article raised. It is clear from the minutes of the Gold Group that Mr Yates was informed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that a large amount of material had been seized. Without undertaking a full scale review, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the light of the challenge to the MPS itself, it would have been sensible and responsive to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the allegations in the article to ask a number of questions. Had the material seized from Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire all been analysed and, if not, why not? What was the basis of the decision to limit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the indictment as drafted and (in relation to the counts on the indictment which it was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggested involved Mr Goodman) to whom was Mr Mulcaire supplying that information and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">why? Who had caused Mr Mulcaire to obtain so many mobile phone numbers, PIN details and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other material which, on the face of it, could give rise to the inference that he was seeking to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">get information by intercepting voicemail messages? Was it right that not all possible charges</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were pursued against News Group personnel? Was there any material to suggest that other</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">reporters were involved? It does not appear that any detailed consideration was (or, indeed,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could have been) given to the substance of what was being alleged.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-43"><a href="#para8-43" name="para8-43">8.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Yates wrote himself a file note on 9 July (or within 24 hours)<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref453" href="#footnote453">453</a></sup> , in which he recorded</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">what material&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref454" href="#footnote454">454</a></sup> Had Mr Yates explored properly these headlines, which he set for himself,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he would (or should) have ascertained the true factual position, namely, that the police held</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">vast quantities of documents that had not been analysed and very few of which had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reviewed or considered by the CPS or Counsel (save only for the very limited purpose of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disclosing unused material). He might also have learnt that, although the terrorism threat</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fully justified limiting what was to be done in Caryatid, there was an entirely reasonable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view that there had been a number of viable leads that could have been pursued had the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation continued.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-44"><a href="#para8-44" name="para8-44">8.44</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Instead, Mr Yates appears to have accepted at face value the information provided by DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Williams, relying only on his memory. Mr Yates was asked to what extent he tested the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">proposition that there was no evidence to implicate other journalists. Mr Yates replied</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he would have asked whether counsel and the CPS saw the evidence and whether the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unused material was reviewed properly.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref455" href="#footnote455">455</a></sup> Given that the CPS was only asked to consider</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the investigation actually undertaken and that the purpose of reviewing unused material is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">limited, the nature of the allegations made by the Guardian meant that this approach was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">plainly insufficient.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-45"><a href="#para8-45" name="para8-45">8.45</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In explaining his limited approach, Mr Yates relied on the fact that he was not briefed that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was circumstantial or indeed other evidence which implicated journalists other than Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Goodman.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref456" href="#footnote456">456</a></sup> DCS Williams has accepted that the initial briefings he gave Mr Yates were not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as thorough as he would have liked and were conducted from memory, without the benefit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of documents, all as part of a hurried response to the Guardian article. It is undeniable that if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams along with his team of officers had been able to recreate for Mr Yates the much</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">more nuanced state of the investigation and the context within which operational decisions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been taken, Mr Yates would have been in a better position to consider the matter and is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unlikely to have publicly expressed himself on 9 July as he did. I am simply not in a position to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">say whether he would have reached a different conclusion.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-46"><a href="#para8-46" name="para8-46">8.46</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I also accept the general principle that it is essential to the efficient functioning of the MPS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that a senior officer is able to rely on the total accuracy of the information given to him by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">officers under his command, and I do not doubt that DCS Williams intended to brief Mr Yates</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">entirely accurately. However, these matters are by no means a complete answer for Mr Yates</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because he had to ensure that he had elicited all material facts from DCS Williams before</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relying on the latter&#8217;s assessment of those facts. Given the very specific allegations made by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Guardian, Mr Yates should have required DCS Williams to explain precisely what had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discovered that could potentially implicate journalists other than Mr Goodman, whatever the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">quality of the information (giving sufficient time to review the material gathered, perhaps</span>




<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">even to speak to the case officers, such as DI Maberly, who had been &#8220;hands-on&#8221; during the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation). Mr Yates, as the senior officer in charge of deciding what the response of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisation to the Guardian article should be, ought then to have considered for himself</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether there were evidential leads and whether there ought to be a scoping exercise with a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view to deciding whether the full investigation should be re-opened.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-47"><a href="#para8-47" name="para8-47">8.47</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further, Mr Yates not only failed to require a more measured review of the position but he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">positively refused to allow it to happen before announcing his conclusions. The action points</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Gold Group meeting on 9 July simply did not include a review of the papers in storage</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or the decision logs. This need not have taken a great deal of time but Mr Yates decided upon</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a very speedy response rather than mature reflection. By not establishing accurately all the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant facts, Mr Yates proceeded on the false assumption that there was no material in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police possession that could justify reconsideration of Operation Caryatid; thereafter, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only question of any interest to Mr Yates was whether the Guardian article revealed any &#8220;new</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">evidence&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-48"><a href="#para8-48" name="para8-48">8.48</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This, then, is the third problem with the exercise that was undertaken on 9 July. The minutes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the Gold Group meeting indicate that it was clearly decided at an early stage that there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was no evidence to justify reopening the investigation: almost immediately, Mr Yates (and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams) had decided to dismiss the Guardian article in its entirety. The final action</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">point was for the Directorate of Public Affairs to prepare press lines for Mr Yates to deliver</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to camera outside New Scotland Yard that afternoon. Although DCS Williams went on to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">retrieve the papers and write a paper with DCS Surtees, the course had been set and a public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">denunciation of the Guardian delivered. Whatever emerged when the papers were retrieved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the decision logs reviewed, it is difficult to see how the MPS would have been able to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">move away from the decision so quickly and so publicly announced.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-49"><a href="#para8-49" name="para8-49">8.49</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This is borne out by the minutes of the Gold Group meeting which suggest that the police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were more astute to manage aspects of public relations than to review the investigation.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As the MPS has accepted, the exercise was framed too narrowly and the decision had all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the hallmarks of haste and none of reflective calm. Lord Blair expressed the same view in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref457" href="#footnote457">457</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;From what I can see, that decision was just too quick. It was just why could you not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have gone back with all those allegations and looked further into what was &#8211; what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">did the material actually say?&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-50"><a href="#para8-50" name="para8-50">8.50</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The result was that, on the afternoon of the day of the Guardian article, Mr Yates issued a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press release<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref458" href="#footnote458">458</a></sup> publishing his conclusion that no additional evidence had come to light since</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the prosecution of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire, and therefore that no further investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was required. In the press release Mr Yates stated that:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;This case has been subject of the most careful investigation by very experienced</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">detectives. It has also been scrutinised in detail by both the CPS and leading Counsel.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">They have carefully examined all the evidence and prepared the indictments that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they considered appropriate.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-51"><a href="#para8-51" name="para8-51">8.51</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This statement was inaccurate. It is known now that neither the CPS, nor Counsel, nor indeed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the investigating officers, had examined all the material for evidence of the involvement of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other journalists. It suggested that the material seized from Mr Mulcaire had been thoroughly</span>


<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">examined and every evidential lead pursued as far as it could be with the results put before</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the CPS and counsel for overarching advice on the widest range of outcomes. Put simply, that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is not what happened: the material had not been analysed for evidence incriminating others.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-52"><a href="#para8-52" name="para8-52">8.52</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MrYateshasclaimedthatDCSWilliamsassuredhimthatcounselhadspenttwodaysreviewing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the material and that no additional suspects had been identified. Given the submissions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made by DCS Williams on this point, it is quite possible that he provided that assurance but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any inquiry would also have revealed that counsel had not been tasked with reviewing the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material in order to advise on the extent to which there was evidence of the involvement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of others. Not only had counsel not analysed the material for that purpose: neither had the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police. Indeed, as explained below, if such an exercise had taken place, it could not have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concluded within two days.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-53"><a href="#para8-53" name="para8-53">8.53</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Both DCS Williams and DCS Surtees have argued that it was their understanding that counsel</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">did &#8220;examine&#8221; all the material seized during the investigation and DCS Williams has submitted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it was the responsibility of the CPS both to advise on charges and to assess whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further evidence was required for the prosecution. With respect, the role of counsel is not to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">act as investigators and, unless specifically so instructed (which is not suggested) it is wholly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unrealistic to suggest that it included examining all the material for evidence that might</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">justify further police investigation against anyone not, at that stage, even the subject of any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">focused investigation.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-54"><a href="#para8-54" name="para8-54">8.54</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When explaining why no further investigative steps were taken in 2006, the officers gave clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence that pursuing the investigation would have required a comprehensive analysis of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the documents seized and that such an analysis would have been an enormous undertaking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and not a straightforward exercise. Mr Clarke and DCS Williams have explained that given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the nature of the material (which included hundreds of unstructured handwritten pages),<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref459" href="#footnote459">459</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was not a question of reading what had been seized from start to finish. Analysing the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material would have required a time-consuming and systematic analysis of the papers, with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the need to create schedules and spreadsheets of the material in order to cross-reference</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all the information. Mr Yates would have known that any review of unused material for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the purposes of identifying exculpatory material would not even have approached such an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involved exercise.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-55"><a href="#para8-55" name="para8-55">8.55</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Yates also addressed in the press statement the question of the number of victims of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unlawful voicemail interception:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Their potential targets may have run into hundreds of people, but our inquiries</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">showed that they only used the tactic against a far smaller number of individuals.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">&#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It is important to recognise that our enquiries showed that in the vast majority</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of cases there was insufficient evidence to show that tapping had actually been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">achieved.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-56"><a href="#para8-56" name="para8-56">8.56</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Given the discoveries that Operation Caryatid had made, these statements were also wholly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inaccurate. The fact that a substantive offence could not be made out for purely technical</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasons would not give the &#8216;potential targets&#8217; comfort in terms of measuring the level of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intrusion to their privacy but it should also be reiterated that the commission of a criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offence under the CMA did not depend for its proof on the precise timing of the interception.</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Yates explained that these statements reflected his genuine understanding and that they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were based on the information he had been given:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref460" href="#footnote460">460</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;That is definitely what I thought at the time, and it was in good faith, based on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">briefings I&#8217;d received, but I absolutely accept now that I got that wrong and I made a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fundamental misjudgment there.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-57"><a href="#para8-57" name="para8-57">8.57</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The minutes of the Gold Group meeting<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref461" href="#footnote461">461</a></sup> demonstrate that Mr Yates was briefed as follows:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;3000 names</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">During searches of defendants premises, large amount of material sei<span style="font-style:normal"> z</span> ed, names,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">numbers etc. One defendant was a private investigator and as they had accessed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mobile phone company systems, they had interest and potentially access to numerous</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people/phones. There was no evidence to prove criminally any other persons phone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had been intercepted. There was strong evidence that they had intercepted 3 Royal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">family aides phones and a further 5 other high profile people, all of which were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">subject to the charges and proceedings in court. Wider people were not informed as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there was no evidence to suggest there was any criminal activity on their phones&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-58"><a href="#para8-58" name="para8-58">8.58</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams was asked during his evidence whether it was correct that the tactic had only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been used against a far smaller number of individuals. He replied: &#8220;It was from my perspective</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">of what would constitute an interception. I totally understand that there is a different view on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that now.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref462" href="#footnote462">462</a></sup> Even if the narrow interpretation of RIPA were correct, however, and therefore</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the police had only positively proved voicemail interception in a small number of cases,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the statement was nonetheless misleading because it suggested that the police had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">able to rule out voicemail interception beyond that small number of victims.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-59"><a href="#para8-59" name="para8-59">8.59</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It also appears therefore that DCS Williams erroneously put forward the need to apply the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">narrow interpretation of s1 of RIPA as one of the reasons why the investigation was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">widened in 2006. Both DCS Williams and DCS Surtees have submitted that counts 16 to 20</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were contained on the indictment in order to &#8220;test&#8221; the law.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref463" href="#footnote463">463</a></sup> DCS Williams said this was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">agreed by the CPS and Counsel to see if the convictions could be secured despite having no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proofthataninterceptionhadtakenplace.ThereisnodoubtthatDCSWilliamsmisunderstood</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or failed accurately to remember the more nuanced advice given by Counsel in August 2006</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the conference he attended and that DCS Surtees acquired the same misunderstanding.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-60"><a href="#para8-60" name="para8-60">8.60</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is surprising that DCS Williams appears to have briefed Mr Yates that others were not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">informed on the basis there was no evidence to suggest that there was any criminality in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to their mobile phones, because the victim notification strategy, which DCS Williams</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had to hand that day, had been designed to ensure that large numbers of potential victims</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were informed because the only criterion was that the &#8220;suspect&#8221; numbers had dialled their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unique voicemail access number.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-61"><a href="#para8-61" name="para8-61">8.61</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is noteworthy that, on 22 February 2012, when he signed his witness statement, Mr Yates</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">apparently still believed that there was no unlawful interception unless it could be proved</span>




<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">that the interception took place before the relevant voicemail message had been heard by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the intended recipient.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref464" href="#footnote464">464</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The important questions that arise from this analysis of events are:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) why Mr Yates carried out this exercise in such a hurried way, without any proper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consideration of the serious allegations made by the Guardian;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) whyDCS WilliamswaspreparedtobriefMrYatesinunqualifiedtermswithoutrefreshing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his memory fully from the decision logs and case papers and did so inaccurately;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) why, within a matter of hours of the Guardian article, both men decided to dismiss the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">article in its entirety; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) to what extent, if at all, can the matters of concern in (a) to (c) above be explained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the relationships Mr Yates enjoyed with individuals at NI or the relationship more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generally between the MPS and NI.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-63"><a href="#para8-63" name="para8-63">8.63</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inmyjudgment,theapproachtakenbyMrYatescanbeexplainedentirelybytheinappropriately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dismissive and closed-minded attitude he adopted from the outset. This attitude stemmed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from two main factors. The first was that he appeared to give less credence to the allegations</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">than they deserved simply because they were made in a newspaper article. The second is the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">defensive mind-set alluded to above. Mr Yates provided an important insight into the level of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">respect he had for the allegations during his evidence when he said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref465" href="#footnote465">465</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;This was a simple exercise and one of a number of exercises that the Commissioner</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or Deputy would ask ACs like me to do almost on a weekly basis. It was an article in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a newspaper, and it was no more, no less than that. So the fact that I sort of cleared</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my diary and did something relatively formal around this, recognising some of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">challenges, is actually qualitatively different than many times you&#8217;d do it. So it&#8217;s what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it was. It was an article in a newspaper. Events make that look very different, I know,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">but give me the credit, this was an article in a newspaper, that&#8217;s what it was about.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It wasn&#8217;t a formal review.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-64"><a href="#para8-64" name="para8-64">8.64</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further, when asked whether the issues raised by the Guardian were wide-ranging, serious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and important Mr Yates said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref466" href="#footnote466">466</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; One looks at the invasion of privacy uncovered by Motorman and Glade and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sentences they got there, which was conditional discharges, so I would not put it at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the serious end. What we know now puts it at the very serious end, but in July 2009 it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was phone hacking. I was three months into a new job as head of anti-terrorism, we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were dealing with the fall-out of a very difficult operation up in Manchester, which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was still going, numerous other high-profile operations involving the security of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">state. This did not present itself as a hugely serious thing in 2009.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-65"><a href="#para8-65" name="para8-65">8.65</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whilst Mr Yates cannot be criticised for judging the relative seriousness of voicemail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interception as markedly less grave than terrorism, this expression of his thinking reinforces</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the view that he did not apply himself fully to the task. Mr Yates has since added that it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant context that he was pressed with challenging work in relation to the ongoing fight</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">against terrorism and the numerous high priority operations in progress. I do not challenge</span>



<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">for one moment that he would have faced such pressures, but it would have been perfectly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasonable for him to discuss with Sir Paul or his Deputy, Tim Godwin, the delegation of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the task of addressing the Guardian&#8217;s allegations to a Deputy Assistant Commissioner or a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commander, or to raise with them any general resourcing concerns that might have precluded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a proper assessment of the allegations: his &#8220;new job as head of anti-terrorism&#8221; and the role</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of his department were, indeed, of critical importance but there was no point in accepting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibility for doing the exercise if he was not prepared to make sure that it was done</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">properly.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-66"><a href="#para8-66" name="para8-66">8.66</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Regarding the defensive facet of the attitude assumed by Mr Yates, Sir Paul Stephenson</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offered the following view why the decision not to reopen the investigation was made and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">maintained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref467" href="#footnote467">467</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think that what happened in 2009 is that within the Met, we developed a fixed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mindset and a defensive mindset around this whole issue &#8230; I think that mindset was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">based on a number of issues, none of which are an excuse as to why we didn&#8217;t get this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">thing right &#8230; I think the start of that mindset was very much about: it&#8217;s inconceivable</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">for people in 2009 to believe that an inquiry led by Mr Clarke would limit itself for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any improper purposes &#8230; I think after that, in the absence of [establishing] what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Met had in its possession &#8211; I think that&#8217;s been rehearsed in this Inquiry and in</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">various places. That&#8217;s regrettable. That absence caused the Met to be more and more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">convinced that the original investigation, therefore was a success in totality, and of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">course that wasn&#8217;t the case &#8230; what we didn&#8217;t do is go back and actually challenge the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reasons for those decisions in 2006 &#8230; We didn&#8217;t go back and challenge the reasons</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">why it was limited because we didn&#8217;t know that it was limited, and had that taken</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">place, we might have been in a better place &#8230; I then go on to think that we got</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ourselves almost hooked on a strategy &#8211; on a defensive strategy that we would not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expend significant resources without new or additional evidence &#8230; the defensive</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">mindset we established was very much based on the flawed assumption that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">original one was successful investigation in totality and the absence of challenge, I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think, led us into some difficulty, if that makes sense.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-67"><a href="#para8-67" name="para8-67">8.67</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The MPS accepts the criticism that it adopted a defensive state of mind. It is worthwhile to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">add that Lord Blair commented:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;But I am clear, and I&#8217;m quite prepared to say it, that was a decision that appears</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">too hasty, and I thought some of the way in which Sir Paul Stephenson suggested</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the closed mindset of because it had been Peter Clarke who had made the decision</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and he was so respected, it was a very interesting piece of what you can describe</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sometimes as group think.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-68"><a href="#para8-68" name="para8-68">8.68</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I find that this defensive attitude was an important factor in explaining the approach taken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by Mr Yates.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-69"><a href="#para8-69" name="para8-69">8.69</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The limited respect Mr Yates had for the allegations by virtue of the fact that they appeared</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in a newspaper combined with his belief (albeit justified) in the absolute integrity of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2006 investigation, no doubt largely because Mr Clarke had been at its helm, translated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into a real reluctance to challenge or revisit past decisions. This attitude prevented him</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from standing back from the article and assessing its allegations dispassionately, despite</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the fact that this is what he had been given the responsibility for doing. In my judgment, it</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">explains his willingness to accept at face value the assurances given by DCS Williams that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation was exhaustive. It led him, almost inevitably, to the peremptory conclusion that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the investigation would not be reopened. It resulted in &#8220;a swift and offensive response&#8221;, as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">described, accurately in my judgment, by Mr Rhodri Davies QC in his closing address. I must</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">make it clear, however, that I do not find that there is any evidence from which to infer that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any relationships with NI in general, or Neil Wallis in particular, contributed to this attitude</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or approach.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-70"><a href="#para8-70" name="para8-70">8.70</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is undeniable that Mr Yates demonstrated poor judgment in failing to have sufficient respect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the allegations made in the Guardian article. The article was not tittle-tattle. On its face</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was a well-researched piece of journalism. It was significant that three years had passed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but the matter remained of real interest to a credible journalist. I also find it significant that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Paul Stephenson (who had only heard about the article on the radio) thought it raised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficiently important issues that he wanted an officer as senior as Mr Yates to &#8220;look at it&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, the then Home Secretary, Rt Hon Alan Johnson MP, said in evidence that at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ACPO conference on 9 July the first conversation he had with Sir Paul Stephenson, in a quiet</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">corner, was about the article. It was unacceptable to treat it in the way that Mr Yates did;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was not the same as any &#8216;article in a newspaper&#8217;. It both demanded and merited a more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered and careful response as the reputational damage to the MPS has since amply</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">demonstrated.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-71"><a href="#para8-71" name="para8-71">8.71</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The defensive mind-set outlined by Sir Paul Stephenson also largely explains the approach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken by DCS Williams. DCS Williams accepted in evidence that his response to the article</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was influenced or indeed governed by his perception that the Guardian was alleging that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police had tried to hide something:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref468" href="#footnote468">468</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; maybe it&#8217;s the wrong perception, my feeling was that they were very much saying</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we were trying to hide something, so my &#8211; that&#8217;s my impression from the coverage,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and I&#8217;m trying to say there was absolutely no intention to hide anything. And this is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what I&#8217;m trying to articulate to Mr Yates.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-72"><a href="#para8-72" name="para8-72">8.72</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams has since accepted specifically that he was defensive but denies that this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prevented him from carrying out an open minded and dispassionate re-evaluation of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decisions taken. I regret that I do not agree. Being open-minded would have led to his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appreciation that there were, indeed, other potential victims and other evidence to examine</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(as he has accepted that he knew) with the result that there was sufficient in the article</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to justify rather more detailed consideration than the few hours it was given. If he had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">remembered the pressure on resources at the time, being open-minded would have led him</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">back to the papers &#8211; not to re-open the investigation but to put himself in the best position</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to analyse the criticisms made of the police. In short, being open-minded meant that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allegations in the Guardian could not be dismissed within hours and DCS Williams should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have appreciated that Mr Yates (who was entitled to rely on him) was doing just that (albeit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">without probing sufficiently or making sure that he understood all the ramifications of what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had happened three years earlier).</span>

<p id="para-id-8-73"><a href="#para8-73" name="para8-73">8.73</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is right that I deal with the further allegation that DCS Williams sought to persuade Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Yates not to reopen the investigation. This was refuted by DCS Williams, who said:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> just</span><span style="font-style:italic"> gave</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an explanation of exactly what we&#8217;d done and the position we had reached&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref469" href="#footnote469">469</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> I</span><span style="font-style:normal"> asked</span><span style="font-style:normal"> DCS</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Williams to explain why he presented to Mr Yates that there was nothing else to do when in</span>


<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">fact there was a great deal that could have been done, albeit that there were understandable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasons why those things were not done. DCS Williams said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref470" href="#footnote470">470</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;No, I see what you&#8217;re saying ... I&#8217;m thinking of it in my head as the evidence I didn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have in my mind of what I would have needed to take that investigation forward, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">if I&#8217;ve created the wrong impression, I&#8217;ve created the wrong impression. It wasn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">done intentionally. I&#8217;m trying to provide a briefing to my senior officer as genuinely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as possible as to what we did and what we didn&#8217;t do then. I&#8217;m saying I haven&#8217;t made</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">these decisions &#8211; I accept I&#8217;m responsible, I was the SIO, no question about that, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I haven&#8217;t done it in isolation, I have briefed and talked to a whole range of people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and I always do that for the purpose of taking advice and talking things through.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Ultimately my decision as SIO where we go with that &#8211; in the parameters I&#8217;ve been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">given with the investigation. I understand what you&#8217;re saying, but I was not doing</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">anything here to mislead or create a false impression.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-74"><a href="#para8-74" name="para8-74">8.74</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The briefing DCS Williams gave was clearly inaccurate and, as set out above, by 2009, he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appeared to have formed the belief that there was &#8220;no evidence&#8221; in police possession that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then could or should be taken forward as part of a further investigation. It is unnecessary for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">me to attempt to make a finding on how he may have come to hold this belief, despite his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contrary understanding in 2006. The effect of the passage of time, with numerous intervening</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigations, combined with the defensiveness alluded to are a potential explanation, but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the purposes of the Terms of Reference, it is sufficient if I make it clear that I accept</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that DCS Williams was acting in good faith and I do not believe that he intended to mislead</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Yates or that his approach was calculated to prevent the investigation being re-opened,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether to protect NI or any other improper purpose.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-75"><a href="#para8-75" name="para8-75">8.75</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Related to the question about the extent to which the Guardian article merited detailed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consideration, Mr Yates was asked to explain why he did not wait for DCS Williams to provide</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">him with briefing notes before issuing his press statement. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref471" href="#footnote471">471</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; we&#8217;d established the facts and the facts were, then, that that Guardian article had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">some new information for the general public, but it wasn&#8217;t new to the investigators</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or to the police, and there was nothing &#8211; there was no new evidence presented by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that article to warrant reopening the investigation at that stage. So I came out and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">said it. I could have waited a week, two weeks and choreographed it and spun it, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I didn&#8217;t. I said it as it was.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-76"><a href="#para8-76" name="para8-76">8.76</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Yates was right to conclude that the Guardian had not revealed anything that would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be new to the police, but that was precisely the point. The Guardian was alleging that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence should have been acted upon. What Mr Yates failed to recognise was that whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Guardian had referred to new material was not the same question as whether re-opening</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the investigation might be warranted. It does not appear to have crossed his mind to ask DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Williams for full details of what information there was that might possibly implicate other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists. Mr Yates had also said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref472" href="#footnote472">472</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;If you look at the list of people who were present at that meeting, all very senior,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">all very experienced. If there had been a scintilla of evidence that said we should be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">doing something differently, I can absolutely assure you they would have challenged</span>



<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">me and I&#8217;d have challenged myself and we would have done something different. The</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">fact of the matter was, as I was briefed, there was nothing else in that article that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">led us to suggest that anything else needed to be done immediately regarding the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation, or anything about the investigation.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-77"><a href="#para8-77" name="para8-77">8.77</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Yates ought to have known that it was not safe categorically to state that there was nothing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to warrant any reconsideration of the investigation, or to rely on the lack of contradiction by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">anyone present at the meeting, in circumstances where no one involved in the investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had had proper opportunity to refresh their memories from the decision logs and case</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">papers. Further, the very fact of the pressure caused by counter terrorism operations could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have alerted those looking back from 2009 to perceive the risk that a decision had been taken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at least in part on the basis that, whatever else the material might reveal if further time was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">spent on it, there were far more pressing operational demands that took priority.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-78"><a href="#para8-78" name="para8-78">8.78</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is remarkable that, even with hindsight, Mr Yates was not prepared to accept that, on 9</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">July 2009, it would have been more accurate to have said that there may well have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence which implicated others, but that the decision was taken in September 2006 to limit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the investigation because such evidence was insufficiently clear and operational demands</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">required use of resources to deal with other, far more pressing, counter terrorism work. He</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref473" href="#footnote473">473</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t accept that&#8217;s the case either. There may &#8211; Keith Surtees may have had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">suspicions and those suspicions are clearly well-founded now, but they weren&#8217;t &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there was no evidence then. If there had been any evidence for us to pursue &#8230; You&#8217;re</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">judging me on 2012 by what was taking place in July 2009 &#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-79"><a href="#para8-79" name="para8-79">8.79</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Yates was asked, directly, whether it was his opinion that there was no evidence at all to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggest that others might be involved, he said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref474" href="#footnote474">474</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, there was the &#8211; you know, the long spoken about &#8216;for Neville&#8217; email, which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">again was covered in terms of what its value to an investigation was on several</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">occasions, not least by the DPP and counsel in terms of what it would value &#8211; its</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">evidential value. There was nothing else that we knew differently then.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-80"><a href="#para8-80" name="para8-80">8.80</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He also said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref475" href="#footnote475">475</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There was certainly a desire to go to the phone hubs and all that. The evidential</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">challenges were paramount, and as far as I was aware from them were completely</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that they could not be overcome.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-81"><a href="#para8-81" name="para8-81">8.81</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Yates said that he did recall the phrase<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> sort</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Mexican</span><span style="font-style:italic"> stand-off</span><span style="font-style:italic"> at</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Wapping</span><span style="font-style:italic"> HQ&#8221;</span> but</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an unusual turn of events at a newspaper&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref476" href="#footnote476">476</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> It</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> put</span><span style="font-style:normal"> to</span><span style="font-style:normal"> him</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> this</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> part</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inferential picture of whether there was evidence generally speaking against others at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW. He was asked if he saw the relevance of the obstruction from that point of view. His</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">answer was:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> do</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> don&#8217;t&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref477" href="#footnote477">477</a></sup></span>





<!--new page--><p id="para-id-8-82"><a href="#para8-82" name="para8-82">8.82</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Yates appears to have adopted without challenge, and maintained, the same mistaken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appraisal of the state of the evidence as DCS Williams, namely that Operation Caryatid</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had disclosed &#8220;no evidence&#8221; that journalists other than Mr Goodman had been involved in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unlawful voicemail interception and had produced no viable leads. Mr Yates contended that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lawyers and police officers have different opinions as to what might constitute &#8220;evidence&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for these purposes. I did not find this distinction to be convincing: in my experience, police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">officers have a well developed understanding of what constitutes evidence and the more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">likely challenge arises when police officers seek to push the boundary of what is provable as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence beyond that which a criminal lawyer will accept.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-83"><a href="#para8-83" name="para8-83">8.83</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Apparently Mr Yates continued to fail to recognise that there was material in police possession</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that was capable of being taken forward. He maintained that it was only with the benefit of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hindsight that his decision not to re-open the investigation was wrong:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref478" href="#footnote478">478</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I have also stated publicly that the decision not to reopen the investigation was a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">poor one in the light of what we now know &#8230; I had no way of knowing at that time</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the extent of the NoTW&#8217;s deliberate cover-up of the wider involvement of others in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">this activity.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-84"><a href="#para8-84" name="para8-84">8.84</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although it is right that Mr Yates cannot have known the extent of the wrongdoing at the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW, or the extent to which it had been concealed, he undoubtedly did not require the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">benefit of hindsight to respond adequately to the Guardian article by identifying the reason</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">why Operation Caryatid had not exhaustively pursued all possible leads, by discerning that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there were parts of the Guardian article that generated concern and by taking rather longer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to consider the position than he was prepared to devote to it. The error of judgment in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">deciding on immediate and prompt dismissal of the allegations by press announcement that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">afternoon should have been apparent at the time.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-85"><a href="#para8-85" name="para8-85">8.85</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It has been argued that I should not reach adverse conclusions without having heard from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Carmen Dowd. For instance, Mr Yates has submitted that it was the advice she gave in 2006</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that influenced his approach to what was achievable given the limited resources available.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The problem facing the police team in 2009, however, was not the advice in 2006. It was that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it was known that there was an enormous body of evidence which had not been examined,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">yet it was decided that there would be no further consideration of the allegations unless</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was &#8220;new evidence&#8221;; it would only have been at that stage, when deciding what steps</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to take in the light of the &#8220;new evidence&#8221; that Mr Yates would have considered resourcing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">priorities.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-86"><a href="#para8-86" name="para8-86">8.86</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, I must deal with two other aspects of the press release issued by Mr Yates on 9 July</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2009. The first concerns the Deputy Prime Minister and asserts:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There has been a lot of media comment today about the then Deputy Prime Minister</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">John Prescott. This investigation has not uncovered any evidence to suggest that John</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">Prescott&#8217;s phone had been tapped.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-87"><a href="#para8-87" name="para8-87">8.87</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This statement was made not only in response to media comment, but also in response to a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">letter received that day from Lord Prescott (then the Rt Hon John Prescott MP). Lord Prescott</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had written to Sir Paul Stephenson asking whether the Guardian had been correct to allege</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the MPS held the names of all those whose phones were targeted, including his, and if so,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">why the police did not inform those people or take any action.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref479" href="#footnote479">479</a></sup> Mr Yates had also telephoned</span>


<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">Lord Prescott, before he spoke to the press, to reassure him that there was no evidence that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his mobile phone had been the subject of voicemail interception.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref480" href="#footnote480">480</a></sup> It is extraordinary that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Yates was prepared to give this assurance both to Lord Prescott personally and in his press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">release because it is clear from the minutes of the Gold Group meeting that DCS Williams</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not able to state definitively that Lord Prescott was not a potential victim. An action</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">point recorded in the minutes was that DCS Williams was to confirm the position; it noted:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;If he had been subject to interception and evidence supported this then he would have been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">informed &#8230;<span style="font-weight:bold"> ACTION</span> &#8211; PW to confirm.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-88"><a href="#para8-88" name="para8-88">8.88</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The minutes suggest therefore that the assurance given by Mr Yates to Lord Prescott was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">based on nothing but an assumption on the part of DCS Williams, which he had not had time</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to confirm, that Lord Prescott could not have been a potential victim because if he had been,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he would have been informed pursuant to the victim notification strategy. This is despite the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fact that DCS Williams did not oversee the strategy to make sure that it had been executed as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intended and, given that it was not in fact overseen by anyone else, DCS Williams could have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">received no confirmation that it had been put fully into effect.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-89"><a href="#para8-89" name="para8-89">8.89</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams has raised in submissions that in a written briefing to Mr Yates, dated 9 July</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2009, a DCS Timmons stated the following:</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Deputy PM John Prescott &#8211; PW and KS without reference to the exact documentation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">believethatMrPrescottwasnotdirectlytargetedalthoughitisbelievedthatmembers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of his staff may have been. There has been no direct contact with Mr Prescott and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">he is not believed on the information available at this time that he was a &#8216;victim of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">interception&#8217;.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-90"><a href="#para8-90" name="para8-90">8.90</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">If this briefing note accurately reflects the position, then it gives a different or additional</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explanation for why he reassured Mr Yates that Lord Prescott was not a potential victim</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of voicemail interception. DCS Williams has submitted that at that time, the view of what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">constituted &#8216;interception&#8217; was narrower. DCS Surtees has also submitted that Mr Yates</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accepted the narrow interpretation of &#8220;victim&#8221; and that up until 2010 everyone was working</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on that interpretation. This all indicates that DCS Williams and DCS Surtees, were briefing Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Yates on the basis that an individual was only a victim if the police could prove that there had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been an interception according to the narrow interpretation of s1 RIPA. It also indicates that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they did not have in mind that whether someone was a &#8220;potential victim&#8221; was as important</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as whether someone could be proved to be a victim, given that the investigation had not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been exhaustive, and ignored the prospect that the individual was a victim of an offence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under the CMA or the target of a conspiracy.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-91"><a href="#para8-91" name="para8-91">8.91</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The following day, after DCS Williams had apparently checked the position, he told Mr Yates</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that Lord Prescott had not been the subject of voicemail interception.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref481" href="#footnote481">481</a></sup> Either DCS Williams</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gave Mr Yates this reassurance on the artificially narrow basis that a person could only be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a victim (or potential victim) if voicemail messages left on his or her own phone had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intercepted, rather than voicemail messages received by people close to him/her, or, if this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not his approach, he gave the reassurance without checking the case papers because if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he had carried out a reasonably careful review of the case papers he would have ascertained:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) either from the papers seized from Mr Mulcaire or from the record of interview of Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire on 9 August 2006 at 16:35 hrs, that Mr Mulcaire had recorded in his papers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the name, John Prescott, with &#8216;advisor&#8217; and then &#8216;Joan Hammel&#8217; underneath and her</span>


<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">telephone numbers and pass codes and an address in NW1; or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) that on 30 August 2006 DI Maberly had emailed Vodafone asking if they could tell him</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether anyone had listened to the voicemail of a number of people, which included</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;Tracey Temple (Prescott)&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> ;</span><span style="font-style:normal"> or</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) that on 2 October 2006 DI Maberly had emailed O2 identifying two persons of concern</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and asking O2 if they featured in the analysis O2 was preparing: the first name was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Joan Hammell (linked to prezza)&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span></span>

<p id="para-id-8-92"><a href="#para8-92" name="para8-92">8.92</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Any of these would have alerted DCS Williams to the fact that Lord Prescott had, indeed, been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suspected of having been either a potential victim or a possible target. Once it is appreciated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that his staff have been targeted, it is not difficult to conclude that they were being used as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">means of learning about his private communications.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-93"><a href="#para8-93" name="para8-93">8.93</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Precisely what happened and the exact thinking of Mr Yates and DCS Williams on this issue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could not be explored without recalling the witnesses and delaying this Report. That would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not have been a proportionate step to take when the failure to notify Lord Prescott was so</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">abundantly clear and the cause of that failure could be narrowed to some form of mistake or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">misjudgement rather than any improper influence connected to NI.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-94"><a href="#para8-94" name="para8-94">8.94</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The second aspect of the press statement which requires further consideration is that Mr</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Yates stated that the MPS was taking all proper steps to ensure that, where there was evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that people had been the subject of voicemail interception or there was any suspicion that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there may have been, that they had been informed. The actions taken to comply with this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undertaking and the extent to which they were successful are below.</span>

<h3>The initial reaction of the CPS</h3>

<p id="para-id-8-95"><a href="#para8-95" name="para8-95">8.95</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Keir Starmer QC, who had succeeded Lord Macdonald as the DPP, was concerned by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assertions made in the Guardian, in particular the claim that deliberate decisions had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken not to prosecute NoTW executives (which could have involved his staff). He therefore</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">convened a meeting at which he asked senior lawyers to conduct an examination of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material supplied to the CPS by the police so that he could be satisfied that appropriate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">action had been taken at the time. He also asked for a chronology, setting out the actions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken and the sources of information.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref482" href="#footnote482">482</a></sup> Simultaneously, the office of the DPP came under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressure from the Home Secretary and the press to explain the nature of its involvement in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2006:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref483" href="#footnote483">483</a></sup> all this demonstrates the extent to which the allegation in the Guardian was not &#8216;just</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">another article&#8217;.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-96"><a href="#para8-96" name="para8-96">8.96</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In contrast to Mr Yates, Mr Starmer explained that he took the Guardian article seriously both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">because of the important issue it raised and because of the number and seriousness of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requests coming in to him that day. They persuaded him that this was something he really</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">needed to understand and that he needed to reconstruct the picture as quickly as possible.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref484" href="#footnote484">484</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-97"><a href="#para8-97" name="para8-97">8.97</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Starmer became aware of the press statement that Mr Yates gave later that afternoon.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This was some of the first information he received and:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;given</span><span style="font-style:italic"> his</span><span style="font-style:italic"> position</span><span style="font-style:italic"> at</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> time,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span></span>



<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to say I took it pretty much at face value in building up the picture&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref485" href="#footnote485">485</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> At</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> stage,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> however,</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he did not know how little time Mr Yates had devoted to his &#8220;establishment of the facts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exercise&#8221;. Later that same evening (9 July 2009) Mr Starmer issued his own press statement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the following terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref486" href="#footnote486">486</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Ihavenoreasontoconsiderthattherewasanythinginappropriateintheprosecutions</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that were undertaken in this case.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In light of the fresh allegations that have been made, some preliminary enquiries</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have been undertaken and I have now ordered an urgent examination of the material</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that was supplied to the CPS by the police three years ago. I am taking this action</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to satisfy myself and assure the public that the appropriate actions were taken in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">relation to that material.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Given the nature of the offences, the amount of material is of course extensive and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">complex, but it has all been located and a small team is now rapidly working through</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it. This process will need to be thorough, so it will necessarily take some time. I am</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">only too aware of the need for urgency and I will issue a further statement as soon</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as this work has been completed. I anticipate being in a position to do so in coming</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">days.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-98"><a href="#para8-98" name="para8-98">8.98</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Again, in direct contrast to the approach taken by Mr Yates, in his press release Mr Starmer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gave a provisional indication but reserved his position until a thorough examination had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conducted.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-99"><a href="#para8-99" name="para8-99">8.99</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is important to appreciate that Mr Starmer intended that this exercise should be limited:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the examination was confined to the material that the police had physically supplied to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">CPS and not the unused material, because reviewing the unused material would have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an extensive and time consuming task.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref487" href="#footnote487">487</a></sup> Thus, for example, the &#8220;for Neville&#8221; email was part</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the unused material and so was not examined.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref488" href="#footnote488">488</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-100"><a href="#para8-100" name="para8-100">8.100</a></p>
 This underlines the point made above:</span> by its very<span style="font-weight:normal;"> nature, unused material is only examined
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the purpose of disclosing material that might undermine a prosecution case or assist</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the defence in a prosecution being mounted. For the DPP, the critical issue was to identify</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">what the CPS had done in the light of the material that had been provided as part of a file</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to prosecute or advise on prosecution. This was a reasonable approach and the fact that Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Starmer wanted some time taken over it also demonstrates a difference from the line taken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the MPS. As it happened, however, due to a misunderstanding, the team at the CPS did</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not examine the entirety of the evidence in their possession. The overlooked documents</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">included the witness statements and exhibits used in the prosecution of Mr Goodman and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Mulcaire.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-101"><a href="#para8-101" name="para8-101">8.101</a></p>
 Unlike the police (where</span> all the relevant officers, save for Mr Clarke, continued in<span style="font-weight:normal;"> service), the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">CPS in general and Mr Starmer in particular were hampered by the fact that Lord Macdonald</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was no longer in post and Ms Carmen Dowd had left the service.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref489" href="#footnote489">489</a></sup> Throughout 2009 and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010, Simon Clements, the new Head of Special Crime Division, was responsible for briefing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Starmer on issues relating to voicemail interception<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref490" href="#footnote490">490</a></sup> although he had not been involved</span>






<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">in the matter in 2006 or 2007. Accordingly, the CPS was reliant, perhaps over-reliant, on what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the MPS told it about the events of those years. The paucity of material available to the CPS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at this early stage is demonstrated by the notes of a conference which took place with junior</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">counsel, Mr Mably, on 10 July 2009.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref491" href="#footnote491">491</a></sup> The principal point which he remembered was the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">need to &#8220;ring fence&#8221; the investigation in order to avoid personal embarrassment to Princes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">William and Harry. Unsurprisingly, he could not recall any of the fine detail of the case.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-102"><a href="#para8-102" name="para8-102">8.102</a></p>
 As if again to underline that this was not simply &#8216;just</span> another<span style="font-weight:normal;"> article&#8217;,</span> the<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 9</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009 also saw
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Chairman of the Culture Media and Sports Committee (CMS) write to Sir Paul Stephenson,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">asking him to submit written evidence to the Committee concerning the investigation into</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail interception.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref492" href="#footnote492">492</a></sup></span>

<h3>After 9 July 2009: the on-going response</h3>

<p id="para-id-8-103"><a href="#para8-103" name="para8-103">8.103</a></p>
 The following day,</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> 10</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009, Mr Yates convened and chaireda second Gold Group meeting
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;to seek update from yesterday&#8217;s meeting&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref493" href="#footnote493">493</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> This</span><span style="font-style:normal"> time</span><span style="font-style:normal"> DCS</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Surtees</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> also</span><span style="font-style:normal"> present.</span><span style="font-style:normal"> The</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">following is recorded in the minutes:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref494" href="#footnote494">494</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The original enquiry team (Op Caryatid) were aware that the defendant &#8211; Glenn</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire was speaking to numerous people and other journalists to the very nature</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of his job. The MPS sent a letter to News of the World asking them to reveal the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">phone numbers for their journalists so a comparison could be made on the seized</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">data. It appeared [Mr Mulcaire] often used the News of the World switchboard so</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it was difficult to confirm who he was speaking with. They refused to co-operate.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Telephone data went into 50,000 + and although further analysis could have been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">conducted to identify other journalists etc, it was decided in conjunction with CPS</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">/ Counsel, to set parameters and from a proportionality point of view, to focus on</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">evidence that would support charges and attract suitable penalty at court for the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">level of criminality involved. Effective use of Police resources was also considered at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the time and discretion to investigate (R v Blackburn). The data examined did not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">unravel a conspiracy with other journalists so was not extended.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;If the MPS were to consider extending remit now then the phone companies no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">longer hold the data so it would not be feasible to investigate. It is also worthy to note</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the victims subject to interception, apart from the two convicted defendants,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they did not have any other suspect / target numbers attempting to intercept their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">phones.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;[DCS Surtees] stated that during the S18 searches of News International the Police</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">team met resistance and threats to use force to remove them from the premises.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There was a general lack of co-operation on their part.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-104"><a href="#para8-104" name="para8-104">8.104</a></p>
 These discussions brought to the attention of Mr Yates that evidence gathered did indicate
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that other journalists might be involved and that further analysis of the telephone data could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been conducted to identify other journalists, but that no analysis was conducted for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasons of proportionality. They also flagged to Mr Yates the strong resistance from NI to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">search. They did not, however, cause Mr Yates to review his decision of the previous day. Even</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if Mr Yates did absorb that there was in fact evidence that might implicate other journalists,</span>




<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">he appears just to have accepted, again at face value, that further investigation would not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">now be feasible. I am driven to the conclusion that having reached his dogmatic conclusion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the previous day, he had closed his mind to the question of whether there might be material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in police possession that could justify reopening the investigation.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-105"><a href="#para8-105" name="para8-105">8.105</a></p>
 This entrenched position is relevant when considering the protestations made by Mr Yates
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that it was not just an eight-hour exercise, but<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> continuing</span><span style="font-style:italic"> exercise</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> reviewing,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> considering,</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reflecting about, you know, whether we were on the right track and whether we needed to do</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">something different.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref495" href="#footnote495">495</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> In</span><span style="font-style:normal"> my</span><span style="font-style:normal"> judgment,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> given</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> emphatic</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> publicly</span><span style="font-style:normal"> announced</span><span style="font-style:normal"> response</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the previous day, to the extent that there was a continuing review at all, it was extremely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">focused, wrongly demanding nothing short of &#8220;new evidence&#8221; before consideration would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given to reopening the investigation. He accepted that after 9 July he did not continue with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the establishment of the facts exercise. His evidence was that the continuing exercise<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">do with all about the victims, actually, all about the victims.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref496" href="#footnote496">496</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-106"><a href="#para8-106" name="para8-106">8.106</a></p>
 DCS Surtees has submitted further evidence<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref497" href="#footnote497">497</a></sup> in which he states that the minutes of 10 July
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2009 were not a wholly accurate reflection of what was discussed and that in this meeting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and subsequent meetings he attended, he was vocal in advancing his view that the matter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be re-opened and re-investigated for the very reason that he knew there were</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidential leads to pursue and that the rationale for closing the investigation in 2006 did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">exist in 2009. He states that he challenged Mr Yates and even suggested that Her Majesty&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) should be appointed to investigate. DCS Williams, in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his further evidence, agrees that DCS Surtees was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;quite</span><span style="font-style:italic"> vociferous&#8221;</span> , at his first meeting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Mr Yates in suggesting that he review or reopen the investigation or that HMIC have an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent look at it.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref498" href="#footnote498">498</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-107"><a href="#para8-107" name="para8-107">8.107</a></p>
 DCS Surtees was not asked about 2009 when the evidence was called and Mr Yates has not
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been asked to respond to what is now said. In the circumstances, as a matter of fairness, I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">am not prepared to reach any conclusion on this issue. By 10 July, however, the scene had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been set both by the briefing given by DCS Williams and the press announcement of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">previous day: it would have required considerably more than DCS Surtees calling for a review</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to persuade Mr Yates to alter the course he had fixed in place. Furthermore, to be fair to Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Yates, it is right to note that in the briefing note to which DCS Surtees contributed, dated 12</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">July 2009, and considered below, the evidence was not represented in a way that steered the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reader to the conclusion that there were viable leads.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-108"><a href="#para8-108" name="para8-108">8.108</a></p>
 It is appropriate next to refer to the fact that,</span> on<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 11</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009, an article written by Andy
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Hayman was published in The Times. In that article, Mr Hayman claimed that the original</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation had<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;left</span><span style="font-style:italic"> no</span><span style="font-style:italic"> stone</span><span style="font-style:italic"> unturned&#8221;</span> and that if there had been the slightest hint</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that others were involved, they would have been investigated. These were extraordinary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assertions to make given the true scope of the investigation and given that Mr Hayman was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not in a position to comment on the thoroughness or otherwise of the investigation because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he was not aware of any of the details. Further, having retired, he had no access to any of the</span>




<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">relevant papers or decision logs.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref499" href="#footnote499">499</a></sup> Mr Hayman said that he based his article on his<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;general</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">broad recollection, of how events were&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref500" href="#footnote500">500</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-109"><a href="#para8-109" name="para8-109">8.109</a></p>
I am satisfied that Mr Hayman was not deliberately intending to mislead and neither do
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I consider it to be proved that he was motivated by a desire to protect NI from further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation; unwisely, however, he made defensive assertions which were based not on fact</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">butonhisassumptionthattheinvestigationwouldhavebeencomprehensive.Heundoubtedly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">believed the detectives working on Operation Caryatid to be tenacious investigators and that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">theywouldhavesoughttoprosecutealloffendersagainstwhomtherewasasufficientlystrong</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case. In reality, without the relevant information, he set about defending the investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(and, by extension, both himself and his former colleagues). Furthermore, it was equally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">imprudent of Mr Hayman to write this article in The Times because, by doing so, he gave the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impression, no doubt inadvertently but undeniably, that he was being deployed by NI to give</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">support to the police line which, itself, was in support of NI.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-110"><a href="#para8-110" name="para8-110">8.110</a></p>
 As referred to above,</span> on<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 12</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009, DCS Williams and DCS Surtees prepareda written
<span style="font-size: 15px;">briefing note for Mr Yates.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref501" href="#footnote501">501</a></sup> DCS Williams believed that the briefing note may well have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">included more detail than he gave orally on 9 July:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;particularly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> when</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it</span><span style="font-style:italic"> goes</span><span style="font-style:italic"> into</span><span style="font-style:italic"> quoting</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">figures, because then we had retrieved the investigative documents from storage and so I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would have been able to do that. On the day, I would &#8211; of 9 July, I would have been doing it to</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the best of my ability of my memory.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref502" href="#footnote502">502</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> DCS</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Williams</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> DCS</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Surtees</span><span style="font-style:normal"> stated</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> following</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in that note:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;14 &#8230; It is clear from these documents that Mulcaire had been engaged in a sustained</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(years) period of research work in various levels of completion. In many there is simply</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the name of a celebrity or well known figure in others there is more detail with names,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, DDN&#8217;s passwords, PIN numbers and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">scribblings of private information. On some there are names which probably relate to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalists and cash sums. (As yet unconfirmed).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;15. It should be noted that no evidence existed to suggest that those possible</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalists detailed on these sheets had knowledge of the illegal methods undertaken</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to supply these stories, however, it should be pointed out that in one of the recordings</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">recovered from Mulcaire it is clear Mulcaire is giving instruction to an unknown person</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(possibly a journalist) on the telephone, on how to access messages of Gordon Taylor.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(As yet unconfirmed who this person is).</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;16. Also recovered were a number of contracts between Mulcaire and the News of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the World, some show agreements to pay Mulcaire a wage of &#163;104,988 per year &#8230; In</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">addition to these contracts other financial documents recovered highlighted individual</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">payments to Mulcaire from the NOTW for instance in the case of Gordon Taylor an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">agreement to pay &#163;7000 once a story had been printed. (All used by counsel in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">criminal prosecution).&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-111"><a href="#para8-111" name="para8-111">8.111</a></p>
 It was also claimed in the briefing note that:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref503" href="#footnote503">503</a></sup>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;All the available evidence in terms of scale and potential role of News of the World</span>





<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was part of the prosecution case &#8230; Nothing has been hidden from the public as to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what was found it has just not had the opportunity to be fully heard.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-112"><a href="#para8-112" name="para8-112">8.112</a></p>
 The content of this briefing note leads me to the conclusion that even when DCS Williams had
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reviewed the investigation papers, his aim when briefing Mr Yates was only to reinforce the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">position that there was &#8220;no evidence&#8221;; that is not surprising given the view that he continues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to maintain and, additionally, the fact that three days earlier Mr Yates had announced that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was nothing new to consider. The conclusion reached on the value of the &#8220;corner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">names&#8221;, at paragraph 14 of the note, appears to have been infected with the inaccurate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">analysis that there was &#8220;no evidence&#8221; that those identifiable by the corner names knew that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Mulcaire was obtaining the information unlawfully (when in fact there was circumstantial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or inferential evidence of the same).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref504" href="#footnote504">504</a></sup> It is clear that the note conveyed that the officers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suspected that the criminality went far beyond just Mr Goodman, but it did not convey any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">belief that there was material that could be developed in a wider investigation. In the light</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of what he has recently argued, it is surprising that DCS Surtees did not ensure that this was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">communicated in the written document.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-113"><a href="#para8-113" name="para8-113">8.113</a></p>
 It is evident that this briefing note introduced Mr Yates to evidence implicating other
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists, albeit the evidence was not given the epithet: &#8220;corner names&#8221;. It is right that the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence was immediately followed by the assertion that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;no</span><span style="font-style:italic"> evidence</span><span style="font-style:italic"> existed&#8221;</span> that those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists knew of the illegal methods used by Mr Mulcaire, but it gave Mr Yates the<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;scintilla</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of evidence&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> had</span><span style="font-style:normal"> protested</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> did</span><span style="font-style:normal"> not</span><span style="font-style:normal"> have.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref505" href="#footnote505">505</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> During</span><span style="font-style:normal"> his</span><span style="font-style:normal"> evidence</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Yates</span><span style="font-style:normal"> said</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he did not know about the &#8220;corner names&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref506" href="#footnote506">506</a></sup> When taken to these paragraphs of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">briefing note, he said that they<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;didn&#8217;t</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hit</span><span style="font-style:italic"> home</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> way&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref507" href="#footnote507">507</a></sup> I find that this reference to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence implicating other journalists did not &#8220;hit home&#8221; precisely because of his closed and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">defensive mind-set, which caused him to overlook the significance of these paragraphs. That</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said, during his evidence, he did not accept that there was in fact any evidence that those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">named knew of the particular method of obtaining the information used by Mr Mulcaire:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; who knows what techniques, lawful or unlawful, private detectives use and how</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they get the information, you know, I can&#8217;t be the judge. What we were worried</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about was is there any evidence around this, and the view I was given was: no, there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">wasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-114"><a href="#para8-114" name="para8-114">8.114</a></p>
 Mr Yates,</span> like DCS Williams<span style="font-weight:normal;"> (and</span> in the briefing note of<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 12</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009</span> at least, DCS<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Surtees), has
<span style="font-size: 15px;">failed to acknowledge the circumstantial or inferential evidential value of the corner names or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to consider how the communications between journalists and Mr Mulcaire might have come</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about or how the information which Mr Mulcaire obtained might have been passed back to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the journalist. I do not pass further comment or reach any further conclusions, however, not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">least because of the current criminal investigations and impending prosecutions of other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists at NoTW and my anxiety not to prejudice let alone appear to prejudge what might</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">emerge at any trial.</span>




<!--new page--><p id="para-id-8-115"><a href="#para8-115" name="para8-115">8.115</a></p>
 The following extract from the briefing note illustrates that DCS Williams and DCS Surtees
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had reminded themselves accurately that there were many potential victims despite the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">continued adherence to the narrow interpretation of s1 of RIPA:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It was clear from the spreadsheet and the lines of data supplied by the telephone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">companies that many potential &#8216;victims&#8217; existed and had been subject to their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">voicemails being called, but that is not sufficient to prove the criminal offence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of interception. The burden is on the prosecution to show they actively led to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">defendant gaining access to voice messages prior to the intended recipient gaining</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">access. The data alone does not even show whether or not messages existed only that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the voicemail had been accessed.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-116"><a href="#para8-116" name="para8-116">8.116</a></p>
 The following is also recorded in the briefing note:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref508" href="#footnote508">508</a></sup>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; Advice indicated that S1 RIPA interception or Computer Misuse Act might be the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">potential offences for what was happening. The latter apparently had a poor track</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">record in terms of conviction, because of the complexity of what had to be proved and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the latter had not been used in respect of telephone voicemail &#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-117"><a href="#para8-117" name="para8-117">8.117</a></p>
 This indicates that DCS Williams had refreshed his memory from the papers sufficiently to
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recall that voicemail interception was not just an offence under RIPA but also under the CMA.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Further, at paragraph 28 of the briefing note DCS Williams and DCS Surtees recorded that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">victim strategy, in broad terms, had been to inform everyone in the bluebook who had had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their unique voicemail access number dialled by the suspects. It continued:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;At the time the strategy recognized that there was still extensive research to be done</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with the phone companies to identify what the full extent of victims might be and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">therefore as outlined under the section above &#8216;How were victim identified&#8217; this could</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be a vastly bigger group of people and in reality we would probably never know the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">true scale.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-118"><a href="#para8-118" name="para8-118">8.118</a></p>
 Unfortunately,</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> however, neither of these factors caused DCS Williams to correct his original
<span style="font-size: 15px;">briefing to Mr Yates concerning the number of victims of voicemail interception which was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the effect that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;police</span><span style="font-style:italic"> enquiries</span><span style="font-style:italic"> showed</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> tactic</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> voicemail</span><span style="font-style:italic"> interception</span><span style="font-style:italic"> had</span><span style="font-style:italic"> only</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been used against a far smaller number of individuals&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><span style="font-style:normal"> In</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> light</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> way</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> DCS</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Surtees now puts the matter, it is surprising that DCS Surtees did not himself later correct this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">misunderstanding: by then, of course, the decision had been made and the defensive line</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">published. Whatever the reason, however, I am confident, however, that it had nothing to do</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with any relationships with NI.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-119"><a href="#para8-119" name="para8-119">8.119</a></p>
 Sir Paul Stephenson explained that during intermittent discussions with Mr Yates, as the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Guardian maintained its coverage, Mr Yates continued to reassure him that there was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nothing new in the allegations that would warrant the reopening of the investigation and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investment of significant additional resources.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref509" href="#footnote509">509</a></sup> To put his involvement in its proper context,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Sir Paul said that the matter was not a priority for him as Commissioner. He occasionally had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discussions with Mr Yates about it, but he would not have delved further into it because it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was getting the right level of senior attention.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref510" href="#footnote510">510</a></sup></span>



<!--new page--><p id="para-id-8-120"><a href="#para8-120" name="para8-120">8.120</a></p>
 Mr Yates chaired two Gold Group meetings on 13</span> July. The first was attended by DCS<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Williams,
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clements and Mr Hussain from the CPS, and D/Supt Dean Haydon.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref511" href="#footnote511">511</a></sup> That meeting dealt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">predominantly with the question of ensuring that the MPS had been sufficiently diligent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in informing potential victims but there was also discussion about whether a letter should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be written to the Guardian encouraging the newspaper to share any new information. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">minutes stated:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref512" href="#footnote512">512</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Following DPA advice, JY decided not to write a letter as the Guardian to date had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not produced any fresh information or evidence in their articles. Their articles were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">based on historical cases. If he did, the Guardian could use spin and claim that he</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">has made a U-turn, had done this under mounting pressure, why was this not done</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">before etc. Press reporting to be monitored in event fresh information comes to light</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to justify writing a letter. Decision &#8211; no letter to be sent to the Guardian at this stage.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-121"><a href="#para8-121" name="para8-121">8.121</a></p>
 According to Mr Clements, Mr Yates told them at that meeting that he was happy to help with
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;piecing together the evolution of the prosecution strategy regarding potential victims&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref513" href="#footnote513">513</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clements and Mr Hussain told Mr Yates that a review was underway and that they would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reveal their findings on Wednesday in a press release.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref514" href="#footnote514">514</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-122"><a href="#para8-122" name="para8-122">8.122</a></p>
 The second Gold Group meeting was attended only by MPS personnel, including DCS Williams
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and DCS Surtees. A separate investigation name, Operation Quatraine, was allocated in order</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to provide a reference point for work done on the recent issues and the costs incurred. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Yates decided that the Gold Group would provide strategic oversight and that all decisions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and records would be recorded in the minutes and that no separate decision log would be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">maintained.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref515" href="#footnote515">515</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-123"><a href="#para8-123" name="para8-123">8.123</a></p>
 On 14</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009</span> the journalist Nick Davies, who had been responsible for the Guardian<span style="font-weight:normal;"> article,
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gave evidence to the CMS Committee. He presented the Committee with copies of a number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of documents including the &#8220;for Neville&#8221; email and the contract with Mr Mulcaire which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">related to the payment of a bonus for the Gordon Taylor story.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-124"><a href="#para8-124" name="para8-124">8.124</a></p>
 Also on 14</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009 David Perry QC and Louis Mably produced the note to which reference
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has already been made (see paragraph 3.2 above).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref516" href="#footnote516">516</a></sup> The key part of the note was the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">following:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref517" href="#footnote517">517</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We did enquire of the police at the conference whether there was any evidence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the editor of the News of the World was involved in the Goodman-Mulcaire</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">offences. We were told that there was not (and we never saw such evidence). We</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">also enquired whether there was any evidence connecting Mulcaire to other News of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the World journalists. Again we were told that there was not (and we never saw any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">such evidence).&#8221;</span>







<!--new page--><p id="para-id-8-125"><a href="#para8-125" name="para8-125">8.125</a></p>
 This record of the answers given by the police understandably influenced the conclusion
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reached by Mr Starmer of how the original prosecution had been handled and the extent to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which there was any need for a re-evaluation in 2009.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref518" href="#footnote518">518</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-126"><a href="#para8-126" name="para8-126">8.126</a></p>
 Mr Yates also claimed to place heavy reliance on this note from counsel but in contrast to
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Starmer, it was not reasonable for Mr Yates to infer from it that counsel had checked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all the material gathered during the investigation for further evidence of criminality. First,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the conference was prior to the review of unused material and was based purely on what</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">counsel were told by the police; secondly, Mr Yates knew (or certainly ought to have known)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the review carried out by counsel (Mr Mably specifically) had been confined to a review</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the unused material which had the particular limited purpose of fulfilling the disclosure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obligations explained above.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-127"><a href="#para8-127" name="para8-127">8.127</a></p>
 When challenged about the legitimacy of relying on this review of unused material, given
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its purpose and that Mr Mably had not been asked to decide how the investigation should</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proceed, Mr Yates accepted the limited nature of the exercise but said that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref519" href="#footnote519">519</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;This was quite an important limb, I would say, in terms of saying, well, okay, he was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">looking at it from the CPI perspective from the indictment, but if counsel is telling</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">me that they never saw any such evidence, then of course I&#8217;m going to place some</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reliance on that. But it was only one limb of a series of aspects which enabled me to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">come to that view, if you like.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">And:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref520" href="#footnote520">520</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, if you read out the sentence in the note, I think it&#8217;s abundantly clear what&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there, and on any reading, exculpatory, CPIA or whatever, they are saying they&#8217;ve</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">done the exercise on CPIA and they never saw any such evidence about others&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">involvement &#8230; I can&#8217;t see any other reading of it that would &#8211; you know, it&#8217;s there.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-128"><a href="#para8-128" name="para8-128">8.128</a></p>
 Whilst it would be fair to find that Mr Yates might have expected counsel reviewing the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unused material to notice a document that stood out as a &#8220;smoking gun&#8221;, he could not rely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on it to conclude that there was no evidence of further criminality.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-129"><a href="#para8-129" name="para8-129">8.129</a></p>
 On 15</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009,</span> the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee<span style="font-weight:normal;"> (adding weight to the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">enquiries being conducted by the CMS Committee) wrote to Sir Paul Stephenson in order to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">put a serious of questions to the MPS.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref521" href="#footnote521">521</a></sup> He asked to be informed of the extent of previous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police enquiries into illegal surveillance by journalists, in particular, whether journalists other</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than Clive Goodman were investigated and why Mr Yates was convinced that no further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation was needed. He also asked whether there was any evidence to indicate the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">existence of arrangements between Mr Mulcaire and other journalists, either at the NoTW</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or elsewhere, which could have included intercepts and other potentially illegal surveillance.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-130"><a href="#para8-130" name="para8-130">8.130</a></p>
 Also on 15</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009 DCS Williams sent an email to the CPS which contained his recollection
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the August 2006 conference with counsel.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref522" href="#footnote522">522</a></sup> Mr Hussain also prepared a submission for</span>





<a name="page379"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">the DPP which set out in summary form the CPS involvement in the case in 2006.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref523" href="#footnote523">523</a></sup> Perhaps</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the most important part of it for present purposes was paragraph 3, which read:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In addition to Goodman and Mulcaire a third man ... was arrested but was not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">charged due to there being insufficient evidence to proceed against him. NO other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">suspects were considered or charged. This has been confirmed to Asker Hussain by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">DCI Surtees: &#8216;no other named suspects ... were confirmed as suspects of criminal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">activity through this investigation&#8217;. Prosecution counsel has also confirmed that there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were no other suspects apart from these three individuals.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-131"><a href="#para8-131" name="para8-131">8.131</a></p>
 The precise content of any conversation between Mr Hussain and DCS Surtees cannot be
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ascertained from this note, but I would expect DCS Surtees not to have given the impression</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there were no evidential leads relating to named individuals even though there were no</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">&#8220;confirmed suspects&#8221; as such.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-132"><a href="#para8-132" name="para8-132">8.132</a></p>
 On 16</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009,</span> following receipt of this submission from Mr<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Hussain, the DPP issueda
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press statement. It stated that the police had provided the CPS with all relevant information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that the approach to charging Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire had been appropriate. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is noteworthy that the press release relates only to those &#8216;identified to the CPS&#8217; and reads as</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref524" href="#footnote524">524</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Having examined the material that was supplied to the CPS by the police in this case,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I can confirm that no victims or suspects other than those referred to above were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">identified to the CPS at the time. I am not in a position to say whether the police had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any information on any other victims or suspects that was not passed to the CPS.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In light of my findings, it would not be appropriate to re-open the cases against</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Goodman or Mulcaire, or to revisit the decisions taken in the course of investigating</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and prosecuting them&#8221;.</span>

 Also on 16</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009</span> DCS Williams wrotea report<span style="font-weight:normal;"> entitled:</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> &#8220;Why</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> didn&#8217;t</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> we</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> expand</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> the
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation?&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> which</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> stated</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref525" href="#footnote525">525</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; My practical assessment was that no matter what we found out [once the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation was overt] any other potential suspects were now firmly aware of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what we were doing and would certainly be taking all steps to avoid incriminating</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">themselves.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Against this backdrop I knew how challenging it had been to get the case this far</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">based upon technical proof (this is a huge challenge which perhaps understandably</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">everyone is underestimating) and now that potential other persons who may or may</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not have been involved were alerted my belief was that we would not be able to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">secure the level of proof necessary to get across the criminal threshold.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Added to the above I knew that any attempt by us would [be] highly likely to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">protracted for the reasons already highlighted and it would risk clouding the issues</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">around a solid, clear and proportionate case.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;All of the above was not a decision that I made in isolation. Throughout, this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation had the highest oversight at all times. The potential breadth/scale of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what may or may not be out there was fully discussed together with what resources</span>



<a name="page380"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">might have been required to even begin exploring that. There was no appetite to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">expand the investigation and the strategic guidance given to me was to continue with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what I had before me as outlined above.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-134"><a href="#para8-134" name="para8-134">8.134</a></p>
 DCS Williams argues that this report demonstrates he communicated to Mr Yates that there
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were evidential leads and that the strategic decision had been made not to follow them</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for resourcing reasons. In the context of the briefings, I do not consider that it would have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conveyed any such message to Mr Yates. The report suggests that the decision was made at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">least predominantly (if not entirely) on the basis of the quality of the evidence and viability</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the leads, rather than making clear that resource concerns overrode considerations of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">quality of the evidence.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-135"><a href="#para8-135" name="para8-135">8.135</a></p>
 DCS Williams also set out his views<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref526" href="#footnote526">526</a></sup></span> on<span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> &#8220;what</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> would</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> be</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> the</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> issues</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> should</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> it</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> be</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> decided</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">now open an investigation into any aspects of NOTW activities from that period&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> :</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold"> 1.</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> Maximum</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> success</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> already</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> achieved</span> &#8211; My rationale for what we did then I believe</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">serves as a strong basis for why it would be highly challenging to find anything more</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that would lead to a criminal prosecution which would have any greater benefit in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">terms of what we have already achieved.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold"> 2.</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> Data</span> &#8211; In terms of practical challenges I doubt whether the necessary data exists</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">now. Even at the time Orange for example only hold what data they had for a few</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">hundred days. So for example to explore in terms of data whether or not Gordon</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Taylor had been the victim of intercept in June 2005 or before as indicated by one</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">seized document was not possible then let alone now.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">around who would want to come forward as a victim/witness. Given that the people</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who are targeted are in the public eye for one reason or another I suspect many of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">them would not want to [be] identified publicly as a &#8216;victim&#8217; due to what it might</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">suggest about their private life.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we would be serving the criminal justice system for the public good, but all we would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">achieve is feeding the civil litigation industry for individual gain at much cost to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">general public.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-136"><a href="#para8-136" name="para8-136">8.136</a></p>
 In my judgment, this is another example of the way in which DCS Williams represented matters
<span style="font-size: 15px;">defensively and in such a way as to reinforce the decision that reopening the investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was unwarranted.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-137"><a href="#para8-137" name="para8-137">8.137</a></p>
 Later that evening,</span> on<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 16</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009, the press office of the DPP received an enquiry from Nick
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Davies as to whether the DPP had called for the NoTW contract and the &#8220;for Neville&#8221; email.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref527" href="#footnote527">527</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This enquiry promoted a flurry of late night activity within the CPS.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-138"><a href="#para8-138" name="para8-138">8.138</a></p>
 On 17</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009 Mr Yates chaireda further Gold Group meeting during whicha question
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was raised about the possible involvement of Neville Thurlbeck (following a question to Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Yates from Chris Huhne MP),<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref528" href="#footnote528">528</a></sup> in light of the &#8220;for Neville&#8221; email. According to the minutes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the meeting, DCS Williams stated that this formed part of his wider prosecution strategy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relating to both suspects and victims, which was still robust to that day. The minutes also</span>



<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">demonstrated that DCS Williams emphasised the lack of co-operation from NoTW during the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation, including no comment interviews, resistance during the searches and refusal to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cooperate with telephone data requests.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-139"><a href="#para8-139" name="para8-139">8.139</a></p>
 After the meeting,</span> but also on<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 17</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009,</span>a briefing note was prepared for Mr<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Yates,
<span style="font-size: 15px;">presumably by DCS Williams, which explained the reasons for not having followed up the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">possibleimplicationsofthe&#8220;forNeville&#8221;email.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref529" href="#footnote529">529</a></sup> Hestressedthatthemeresightoftranscripts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of conversations is not itself sufficient evidence to charge with an offence of conspiracy to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intercept communications. He explained that:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It is important to differentiate the investigative strategy and risk reduction strategy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">taken at the time, to the very different focus today of whether in fact lots of journalists</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at the NOTW or elsewhere were involved in a criminal conspiracy.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">&#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Police could have arrested Thurlbeck and/or others. The experience police had of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the stance taken by News International staff led them to suspect that any other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalists arrested would not readily assist police by answering any questions this</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would inevitably leave investigators with insufficient evidence to charge others.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Further enquiries were undertaken by investigators to prove the involvement of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other journalists by requesting telephone information and floor plans from News</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">International at the time. These were frustrated from the outset.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-140"><a href="#para8-140" name="para8-140">8.140</a></p>
 For their part,</span> during the course of<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 17</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009,</span> the CPS ascertained that the<span style="font-weight:normal;"> &#8220;for</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> Neville&#8221;
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material was part of the unused material and nothing more. A copy of the email was faxed by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the MPS to the CPS later that day, and drawn for the first time to the attention of Mr Starmer.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clements told Mr Starmer that he had spoken to D/Supt Haydon and that:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Met</span><span style="font-style:italic"> do</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not consider that the email in question has the significance that the Guardian attribute to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref530" href="#footnote530">530</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> Mr</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Starmer</span><span style="font-style:normal"> was</span><span style="font-style:normal"> immediately</span><span style="font-style:normal"> concerned</span><span style="font-style:normal"> about</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> email,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> because</span> &#8220;[w]hatever view</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">question, Mr Starmer indicated that his assessment of the email was that it was more in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nature of an evidential flag or pointer than a &#8216;smoking gun&#8217;, although, even on that basis, he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">recognised that it did not correspond with the reasonably firm assurance he had been given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there had not been thought to be other suspects.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref532" href="#footnote532">532</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-141"><a href="#para8-141" name="para8-141">8.141</a></p>
 At 4pm</span> on<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 17</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009</span>a meeting took place between Mr Starmer and David Perry<span style="font-weight:normal;"> QC. The
<span style="font-size: 15px;">latter confirmed his recollection of the answers the police gave to his questions regarding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other possible defendants. However, Mr Starmer was still concerned about the email and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decided to write to Mr Yates inviting him to consider whether further investigation was now</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">required. A draft press statement had been prepared to that effect, but, following discussions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with Mr Yates later that evening Mr Starmer was persuaded not to issue the statement but to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meet Mr Yates the following Monday morning (20 July 2009) to discuss the email in greater</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">detail. During the course of the Friday evening discussions which followed the meeting with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Perry, Mr Starmer sensed a degree of &#8220;push-back&#8217; from Mr Yates against his suggestion</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there should be a reinvestigation or further investigation of the &#8220;for Neville&#8221; email. Mr</span>




<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">Starmer did not suggest that there was anything sinister or untoward about this, given the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">time of day.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref533" href="#footnote533">533</a></sup> Following those discussions, Mr Starmer issued a press statement which merely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> DPP</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> now</span><span style="font-style:italic"> considering</span><span style="font-style:italic"> whether</span><span style="font-style:italic"> any</span><span style="font-style:italic"> further</span><span style="font-style:italic"> action</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> necessary.&#8221;</span></span>

<p id="para-id-8-142"><a href="#para8-142" name="para8-142">8.142</a></p>
 On Monday 20</span> July, the meeting with Mr Yates and others<span style="font-weight:normal;"> (including</span> DCS<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Williams) took place
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as arranged; the notes made on behalf of the MPS have been made available to the Inquiry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref534" href="#footnote534">534</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Starmer explained to the police that Mr Perry had told him that he could not remember</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discussing the &#8220;for Neville&#8221; email at the time of the prosecution. DCS Williams reiterated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the point that there had been discussion about other possible defendants. The following</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appeared in the notes:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;KS. David and Louis asked if evidence<span style="font-style:normal"> editor</span><span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> other</span><span style="font-style:normal"> journalists.</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Told</span><span style="font-style:normal"> not.</span><span style="font-style:normal"> Saw</span><span style="font-style:normal"> no</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence to support&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-143"><a href="#para8-143" name="para8-143">8.143</a></p>
 Mr Starmer confirmed that this assertion was never contradicted by anyone present at the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meeting.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref535" href="#footnote535">535</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-144"><a href="#para8-144" name="para8-144">8.144</a></p>
 According to Mr Starmer, the key contribution made by Mr Yates to the meeting was that this
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not new material; it had been seen by counsel and that the police investigation focused</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on set parameters, which were an operational matter for the police; furthermore, in any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">event,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> email</span><span style="font-style:italic"> will</span><span style="font-style:italic"> go</span><span style="font-style:italic"> nowhere&#8221;.</span> Unsurprisingly, Mr Starmer was not entirely comfortable</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">with this response, given that Mr Perry did not have a recollection of seeing the email, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the extent that it might have been seen by junior counsel this was in a specific and limited</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">context; that the &#8216;set parameters&#8217; rather begged the question; and that his assessment of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidential strength of the email was not the same as the assessment made by Mr Yates. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">matter was left on the footing that Mr Starmer would seek written advice from Mr Perry on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the status of the email, and that DCS Williams would do a background note to avail him.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-145"><a href="#para8-145" name="para8-145">8.145</a></p>
 Shortlyafter6pmthatevening,DCSWilliamssenttheCPSabriefingnote,astheyhadrequested,
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which he entitled<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Challenges</span><span style="font-style:italic"> faced</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> investigation</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> subsequent</span><span style="font-style:italic"> prosecution&#8221;</span> for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the CPS.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref536" href="#footnote536">536</a></sup> Under the rubric &#8220;Challenges&#8221;, DCS Williams set out his understanding of the law</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which continued to be based on the narrow view of RIPA 2000. He also made a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">observations in the note about the &#8220;for Neville&#8221; email, all of which tended to suggest that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">neither in 2006 nor in 2009 could it amount to evidence that the criminality at the NoTW went</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">beyond Mr Goodman. For instance, he set out his analysis that there was nothing to indicate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that &#8220;Neville&#8221; had actually seen the document and that even if he had, reading the email</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would not have been an offence and so there was no evidence to link him to a conspiracy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to intercept communications. It is worthy of additional note that this specific analysis of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">email was also to form the basis of the evidence Mr Yates gave to the CMS Committee.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-146"><a href="#para8-146" name="para8-146">8.146</a></p>
 Mr Starmer was anxious to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and so he asked Mr Perry
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to provide an &#8216;overnight&#8217; advice, that is to say before the following morning. In effect, the DPP</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wanted Mr Perry to answer the following four very specific questions:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref537" href="#footnote537">537</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) based on his knowledge of the case in 2006 and in particular the technical and practical</span>





<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">issues associated with proving offences of interception, what advice would he have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given to the CPS/police at the time in respect of the &#8220;for Neville&#8221; email, had it been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">brought specifically to his attention?</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) based on his knowledge at that time (July 2009), would his advice be any different?</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) based on his knowledge in 2006 whether he was of the view that the police had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sufficient to arrest and/or interview &#8220;Ross&#8221; and/or &#8220;Neville&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) based on his knowledge at that time (July 2009) whether he was of the view that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police had sufficient to arrest and/or interview &#8220;Ross&#8221; and/or &#8220;Neville&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-147"><a href="#para8-147" name="para8-147">8.147</a></p>
 At the time of the urgent request for advice, Mr Perry did not have access to his original papers
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and was also working under the pressure of a court appearance. Rather than seek further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">time from Mr Starmer, Mr Perry decided to rely on what he could recall of the prosecution</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and on the briefing note provided by DCS Williams. He set out his advice under the heading</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Draft Advice&#8221; although it was not expressed to be contingent on any further information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or input from either the MPS or the CPS and was never replaced by a further document.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The advice arrived at the CPS at 09:40 hrs the following morning, namely 21 July 2009.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref538" href="#footnote538">538</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Perry indicated that he only had a dim recollection of the decisions taken in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the investigation and prosecution strategy, but that he had found the note prepared by DCS</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Williams to be extremely helpful and to accord with such recollection as he did have. Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Perry expounded the narrow view of the law in lapidary and unqualified terms:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; to prove the criminal offence of unlawful interception contrary to section 1(1) of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, it is necessary to prove that the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">message was intercepted before it was accessed by the intended recipient.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-148"><a href="#para8-148" name="para8-148">8.148</a></p>
 Mr Perry also appeared to suggest that he gave the same advice to the police and the CPS
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in 2006.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref539" href="#footnote539">539</a></sup> He stated in his advice dated 20 July 2009 that the &#8220;for Neville&#8221; email did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cause him to acquire a different view of the merits of pursuing other possible defendants. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adopted eight of the nine points made by DCS Williams in relation to the evidential value of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the email.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-149"><a href="#para8-149" name="para8-149">8.149</a></p>
 Mr Perry has accepted that his statement about the law was too emphatic and that he had
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been over-reliant on the briefing note.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref540" href="#footnote540">540</a></sup> Given that he did not have his papers and was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advising overnight, I am fully prepared to accept the explanation why he expressed this view,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">despite having given different advice in the conference with the CPS and the police in August</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">2006.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref541" href="#footnote541">541</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-150"><a href="#para8-150" name="para8-150">8.150</a></p>
 With the benefit of hindsight,</span> Mr Starmer has since said that it would have been better<span style="font-weight:normal;"> if,
<span style="font-size: 15px;">before Mr Perry committed himself, he had been given more time along with the opportunity</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to check his papers. That is undoubtedly right but, despite his understandable anxiety to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meet the very tight deadline set by the DPP, Mr Perry should not have given unequivocal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and unqualified advice, which in any event did not reflect the considered advice he gave</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in 2006, without, first, re-acquainting himself sufficiently with the law and relevant factual</span>




<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">background; secondly, reviewing his papers relating to the prosecution; and, thirdly, if it was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">necessary, reconsidering the likely interpretation of s1 of RIPA. He should not have permitted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">himself to rely almost entirely on a briefing note provided by DCS Williams (whom he did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">blame) or to assume that it was accurate or reflected the advice he gave in 2006.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-151"><a href="#para8-151" name="para8-151">8.151</a></p>
 Although it might have caused his client some frustration,I have no doubt that Mr Perry
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should have told Mr Starmer that he needed more time before he could give accurate advice;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">alternatively, he could have expressed a view only on a provisional basis following it up</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">shortly thereafter, when the papers were to hand and the necessary time available. Entirely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accurately, Mr Perry summarised the position by saying that:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> moral</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> story</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is:</span><span style="font-style:italic"> don&#8217;t</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">on the advice given by Mr Perry, Mr Starmer confirmed that it would not be appropriate for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">him to reopen the cases against Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire, nor to revisit the decisions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken in the course of investigating and prosecuting them.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-153"><a href="#para8-153" name="para8-153">8.153</a></p>
 On 25</span> August<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009</span> DCS Williams provided what he calleda<span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> &#8220;very</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> rough</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> draft&#8221; opening
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statement for the CMS Committee hearing. It included the following paragraph which, in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstances, did not fully reflect the complete picture of what had happened in 2006:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref544" href="#footnote544">544</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold"> Suspects</span> &#8211; In 2006 Police, CPS and Senior Counsel considered whether or not there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was evidence against anyone else and in the light of recent concern have revisited that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decision. Supported by Senior Counsel the collective belief is that when set against</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">both the investigation and prosecution strategy there was and remains insufficient</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">grounds to arrest and /or interview anyone else.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-154"><a href="#para8-154" name="para8-154">8.154</a></p>
 Presumably for the purposes of the CMS Committee hearing,</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref545" href="#footnote545">545</a></sup> DCS Williams prepareda

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Post arrest at a case conference between police, CPS and Council [sic] the extent of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what we could legally ask for access to through a Production order was discussed and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">again based on the evidence we had that was deemed highly likely to be limited to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the activities of Goodman and potentially Mulcaire &#8211; in affect [sic] we would not be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">allowed to do anything that might be looked upon as a &#8216;fishing exercise&#8217;.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;NOTW solicitors had already made it known of their desire to cooperate with the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation and the best way forward was decided to be through cooperation, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to explore/prepare a production order in tandem to be used as legally possible.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-155"><a href="#para8-155" name="para8-155">8.155</a></p>
 DCS Williams then explained how Burton Copeland had responded to the various request for
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information in the following terms:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Throughout it would be fair to say that NOTW took a robust, but legal approach to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">our requests and provided the material in relation to Goodman and Mulcaire only, e.g.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the payments to &#8216;Alexander&#8217; &#8211; total &#163;12,300. What was received did indeed become</span>




<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">part of the prosecution, but we did not have the legal basis with which to push our</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation further.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-156"><a href="#para8-156" name="para8-156">8.156</a></p>
 On 3</span> November<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009</span> the DPP wrote again to the Chairman of the CMS<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Committee. He set
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out in that letter that the advice given by Mr Perry had been that the narrow interpretation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of s1 RIPA was correct and that there was nothing to be gained from seeking to contend for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a wider interpretation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref546" href="#footnote546">546</a></sup> On the same day Mr Yates also wrote to the Chairman of the CMS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Committee. He confirmed that the police had in their possession hundreds of<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;unstructured</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">handwritten sheets&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> showing</span><span style="font-style:normal"> research</span><span style="font-style:normal"> into</span><span style="font-style:normal"> many</span><span style="font-style:normal"> people</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> public</span><span style="font-style:normal"> eye.</span><span style="font-style:normal"> He</span><span style="font-style:normal"> said:</span> &#8220;It is not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">necessarily correct to assume that their possession of all this material was for the purposes</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of interception alone and it is not known what their intentions was<span style="font-style:normal"> [sic]</span> or how they intended</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to use it.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref547" href="#footnote547">547</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-157"><a href="#para8-157" name="para8-157">8.157</a></p>
 Before leaving this section, it is important to deal with the allegations that have been made
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the integrity of Mr Yates. I recognise that I have strongly criticised his decisions not just</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the benefit of hindsight (which is no criticism at all) but having regard to what he knew</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or could have discovered. As to the question of ulterior motive, however, it is important to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">analyse the evidence. On this question, Mr Yates said:</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; I absolutely know what I did on July 9th, I know what I was provided with, I know</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the judgment I made. You know, time has shown that to be &#8211; and what&#8217;s happened &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not the greatest call, but at that time it was the right call, and it wasn&#8217;t influenced in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any way, shape or form by other matters.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-158"><a href="#para8-158" name="para8-158">8.158</a></p>
 Those who worked closely with Mr Yates were and are convinced of his integrity. DCS Williams
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(whom I have also criticised) said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref548" href="#footnote548">548</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; In my workings with [Mr Yates], I&#8217;ve not worked with him directly before, but</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I saw nothing or heard nothing that me think that we &#8211; that there was anything</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">wrong going on here, that we were looking to hide anything. He was looking at an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation that was four years old. I briefed him and over the period I believe he</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was genuinely seeking to understand what had happened and make proportionate</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">decisions. I just want to assure you that I&#8217;ve seen nothing that makes me think that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there is anything other than a genuine desire to do a proper investigation and to keep</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the public informed about what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-159"><a href="#para8-159" name="para8-159">8.159</a></p>
 As for more senior officers,</span> Lord Blair offered the following<span style="font-weight:normal;"> assessment:
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Do I believe that John Yates took that decision in order to placate News International?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">No, I don&#8217;t. I just don&#8217;t believe that he did that. But his difficulty, without making it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">more difficult for him, is the number of contacts, and that, I think, is a problem.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref549" href="#footnote549">549</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-160"><a href="#para8-160" name="para8-160">8.160</a></p>
 Sir Paul Stephenson was convinced that Mr Yates acted in good faith.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref550" href="#footnote550">550</a></sup> He added<span style="font-weight:normal;"> that:</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> &#8220;I
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think we ended up defending instead of challenging. Do I believe that there was a deliberate</span>





<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">attempt to back off because it was News International? No, I do not, sir.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref551" href="#footnote551">551</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> He</span><span style="font-style:normal"> made</span><span style="font-style:normal"> clear</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he did not believe that fear of taking on a powerful enterprise<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;comes</span><span style="font-style:italic"> into</span><span style="font-style:italic"> it&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref552" href="#footnote552">552</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-161"><a href="#para8-161" name="para8-161">8.161</a></p>
 In reality, there is no evidence from which it would be right to infer that Mr Yates was swayed
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in his decision making by his friendship with Mr Wallis or his relationships with NI more</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generally. That he did not take the Guardian article (or the follow up) seriously enough is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">beyond doubt but I do not believe that he was acting out of fear of NI, or in a desire to protect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Neil Wallis or NI or, indeed, to garner favours from the organisation.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-162"><a href="#para8-162" name="para8-162">8.162</a></p>
I have considered also the subtler point whether because he knew the personalities of the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">leaders at the NoTW and had amicable relations with them, he was less prepared to think ill</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of what they had been doing. I agree with Mr Garnham QC that I do not have the evidence to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">make such a finding. I do not consider there is any basis for concluding that Mr Yates would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">permit or did permit his own personal knowledge of individuals to influence his assessment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of whether they may be involved in obtaining information for stories by criminal means.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Whatever conclusions I reach about the way in which Mr Yates went about discharging his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">responsibilities in 2009-2010, I do not challenge his integrity.</span>

<h3>The second attempt to ensure that all potential victims had been informed</h3>


<p id="para-id-8-163"><a href="#para8-163" name="para8-163">8.163</a></p>
 Having undertaken on 9</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009</span> to ensure that all suspected victims had been<span style="font-weight:normal;"> informed,
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on 10 July 2009, Mr Yates issued a press statement asserting that:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> process</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> contacting</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people is currently underway and we expect this to take some time to complete&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span></span>

<p id="para-id-8-164"><a href="#para8-164" name="para8-164">8.164</a></p>
 In the briefing note dated 12</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009, DCS Williams and DCS Surtees told Mr Yates that
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although it was not known in detail what actions each mobile phone company took, the steps</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they did take included<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;contacting</span><span style="font-style:italic"> customers</span><span style="font-style:italic"> who</span><span style="font-style:italic"> they</span><span style="font-style:italic"> thought</span><span style="font-style:italic"> might</span><span style="font-style:italic"> have</span><span style="font-style:italic"> been</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> victim&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref553" href="#footnote553">553</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">They gave Mr Yates this assurance despite the fact that neither had ensured either that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">phone companies understood that this was their responsibility or that the phone companies</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had, in fact, informed their customers. It is plain that Mr Yates was significantly misinformed.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">No doubt reassured by this briefing, at the first Gold Group meeting on 13 July 2009, Mr Yates</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">gave DCS Williams and DCS Surtees the task of reviewing the remainder of the list to establish</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if there were any other potential victims that should be informed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref554" href="#footnote554">554</a></sup> He also gave DCS Surtees</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the responsibility of confirming, from the files, who the police had informed and when. It is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fair to note that Mr Yates was, indeed, seeking to honour his public undertaking to ensure</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that all potential victims had been informed.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-165"><a href="#para8-165" name="para8-165">8.165</a></p>
 DCS Surtees has submitted that this tasking was predicated on the narrow interpretation of
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8216;victim&#8217;, namely that a person was only a victim if there was proof that a voicemail message</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">sent or received by him/her was intercepted before it was heard by the intended recipient.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is very surprising that DCS Surtees has made this submission given that it is wholly at odds</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the wording of the original victim notification strategy and the summary of the victim</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">notification strategy that he and DCS Williams gave in the briefing note of 12 July 2009. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is also at odds with the undertaking Mr Yates made on 9 July 2009 to inform all victims,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including those where there was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;any</span><span style="font-style:italic"> suspicion&#8221;</span> that they might have been victims and with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the minutes of the second meeting on 13 July 2009, the relevant extract of which is set out in</span>




<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">the paragraph below. If this was the approach, it is difficult to explain how it developed. DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Surtees does also make the point that the meetings record only a small part of the discussions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that took place.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-166"><a href="#para8-166" name="para8-166">8.166</a></p>
 In the minutes of the second meeting on 13</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009,</span> it was recorded that, over the<span style="font-weight:normal;"> weekend,
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the police had informed Andy Coulson that he was a potential victim and that attempts had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been made to contact seven others, albeit only one of those seven attempts was successful.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref555" href="#footnote555">555</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The following was also noted:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Over weekend. PW reviewed all files again and decided original victim strategy still</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">stood re informing people (i.e. nothing had changed, apart from Coulson position)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and after speaking with JY, it was decided no further contact was attempted with</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">any other people. Weekend focus was then diverted to preparing briefing note and</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;PW stated after reviewing list there were approx. 60 people with activity on their</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">phones. JY asked rationale for not informing them now. PW stated they had been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in contact with phone companies and they were compiling in writing what they did</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at the time. Response should [be] received in next 24 hours and therefore decision</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">pended until we see phone companies&#8217; response in event there could be duplication</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of work. Press line should read presently &#8211; not prepared to discuss (this is personal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">data).&#8221;</span>

 It is not clear how DCS Williams reached the conclusion that<span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> &#8220;the</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> original</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> victim</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> notification</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">strategy still stood&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> given</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> reality</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> it</span><span style="font-style:normal"> had</span><span style="font-style:normal"> substantially</span><span style="font-style:normal"> failed.</span><span style="font-style:normal"> The</span><span style="font-style:normal"> evidence</span><span style="font-style:normal"> indicates</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that this correspondence with the phone companies was the first attempt by the police to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">check that the phone companies had been notifying potential victims in line with the victim</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">notification strategy.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-168"><a href="#para8-168" name="para8-168">8.168</a></p>
 On 14</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009</span> DI Maberly receiveda response from<span style="font-weight:normal;"> O2 to this correspondence from the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police asking them about what steps they took following the investigation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref556" href="#footnote556">556</a></sup> O2 said:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The matter was fully investigated, and information came to light indicating a small</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">number of additional O2 customers who may have been targeted in the same way.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;All the O2 customers affected were contacted by the O2 Fraud & Security Team in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">May 2006. The customers were advised that there may have been an attempt by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a third party to access their voicemail messages. They were told we were making</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">changes to the voicemail systems to stop this happening, and advised that O2 were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">working with the police to assist in providing evidence to identify and prosecute those</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">responsible. Some customers requested their details be passed on to the police, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this was done.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-169"><a href="#para8-169" name="para8-169">8.169</a></p>
 Vodafone and Orange also replied within the month. They set out what steps they had
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken but neither mentioned having taken any steps to identify or inform potential victims</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of voicemail interception.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref557" href="#footnote557">557</a></sup> Surprisingly, despite the imperative to identify individuals who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might not have been informed and the clear instructions from Mr Yates, it does not appear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the police made any attempt to follow this up with Vodafone or Orange and query</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whether they had notified any potential victims. Neither have I seen evidence that Mr Yates</span>



<a name="page388"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">subsequently asked DCS Williams or DCS Surtees what had been ascertained from the phone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">companies.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-170"><a href="#para8-170" name="para8-170">8.170</a></p>
 On 22</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009,</span> as part of Operation<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Quatraine, Mr Yates directed that all the material seized
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire be scanned onto &#8220;ALTIA&#8221;. ALTIA was a relatively new</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">IT system, which had not been available when the investigation began, which enabled the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">mass scanning of hard copy exhibits to make them searchable on the HOLMES database.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This was intended to assist the MPS in responding to the growing number of requests for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref558" href="#footnote558">558</a></sup> from individuals who were concerned that their voicemail messages may have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been intercepted. An email drafted on behalf of Mr Yates indicated that the exercise was to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be a priority. The email read:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref559" href="#footnote559">559</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It is of critical importance to the MPS and the command that this is progressed as a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">priority and this requires attention today please to coordinate.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-171"><a href="#para8-171" name="para8-171">8.171</a></p>
 Mr Yates explained that around ten detectives spent over four months undertaking this task
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at a cost of over &#163;200,000. It is noteworthy that those working on the exercise appear to have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been directed that if, when examining the exhibits, they identified potential further leads for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation, they should be referred to the SIO for consideration.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref560" href="#footnote560">560</a></sup> However, no such leads,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">if identified at all, were brought to the attention of senior officers, and the task of scanning</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">documents was not properly completed. Mr Yates said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref561" href="#footnote561">561</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I mean &#8230; in fairness to me &#8211; on 23 July or whatever it was &#8230; I was so concerned</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">about our inability to analyse the material in any shape or form that I asked for it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to be put on the HOLMES system. You have that email in your pack, where I&#8217;ve said</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as a matter of priority I took people off counter terrorism operations to put all the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">material on the HOLMES system.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Now, if during that exercise run by detectives who, you know, would have a detective</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">outlook, I would have expected, if concerns began to be raised about what&#8217;s actually</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in that material, stuff that&#8217;s come out, that I would have been told, but that didn&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">happen. So I was sufficiently exercised, as critical incident in the Met parlance, to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">put the stuff on a computer, to invest I think it was ten detectives for three or four</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">months working long days to put all this material on a system so I could search it, so</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I could actually with confidence say &#8211; when people wrote in, I could say you&#8217;re either</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on the system or not on the system. Now unfortunately that exercise wasn&#8217;t done as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">thoroughly as it should have been.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-172"><a href="#para8-172" name="para8-172">8.172</a></p>
 On 24</span> November<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009, having been contacted by Nick Davies for information about whether
<span style="font-size: 15px;">all potential victims had been informed, Orange wrote to DI Maberly in the following terms:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve drafted a press statement &#8211; the part relevant to the issue in question (i.e. if we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were &#8216;asked&#8217; to investigate and contact customers) is:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We were not asked nor felt it right to further investigate these customers as this was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">part of the Police investigation. We were also advised not to contact these customers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as it could jeopardise the investigation and prejudice any subsequent trial.</span>




<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Do you think this is fair comment? ...&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DI Maberly replied the following day and said:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the comments are totally fair. Let me speak to our legal team / SIO</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">(Senior Investigating Officer), who may have a documented record of the strategy</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">agreed at the time.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-173"><a href="#para8-173" name="para8-173">8.173</a></p>
 Orange replied withina few minutes and said:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref562" href="#footnote562">562</a></sup>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Unfortunately we have responded but would be happy to issue a clarification if</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">necessary. We&#8217;re not disputing that the ball was in our court, just that no specific</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">[italics in original] request was made to investigate and contact&#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-174"><a href="#para8-174" name="para8-174">8.174</a></p>
 There does not appear to have been any real reaction to the implications of this email
<span style="font-size: 15px;">correspondence or beginnings of a recognition that the victim notification strategy had failed.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-175"><a href="#para8-175" name="para8-175">8.175</a></p>
 On 25</span> January<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2010,</span> DI Maberly emailed<span style="font-weight:normal;"> O2</span> and<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Orange, explaining that followinga review of
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material requested by DCS Williams, the police had identified a<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> small&#8221;</span> number of people</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who were a target for interception but who had not been informed of this. Presumably these</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">were individuals who, pursuant to the victim notification strategy, should have been notified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the police. DI Maberly also explained that the police were intending to give the relevant</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">numbers to the phone companies in order to ascertain to which network they belonged at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the time and might then ask the phone companies to make contact with those customers. O2</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">replied that day in the following terms:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref563" href="#footnote563">563</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We identified a number of customers we believed may have had their voicemails</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">intercepted and I advised Philip Williams at the time that we intended to proactively</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contact them and let them know. We could not say for certain that their voicemail</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had been intercepted only that there was evidence it had been attempted. From my</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">memory this was approximately 40 customers, certainly not more than that number.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The only customers from this list we did not contact as part of that process were the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">members of the royal household that the police were dealing with directly. We had no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information that voicemail messages belonging to any additional customers on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">O2 network had been intercepted or had interception attempted.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-176"><a href="#para8-176" name="para8-176">8.176</a></p>
 This demonstrates that O2 informed their customers because they made the independent
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decision to do so and not pursuant to a request from the police.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-177"><a href="#para8-177" name="para8-177">8.177</a></p>
 Orange also replied the same day stating that they told Nick Davies that they had given
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the police the phone numbers of 45 Orange customers whose voicemails boxes had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accessed by the suspect numbers provided by the police.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref564" href="#footnote564">564</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-178"><a href="#para8-178" name="para8-178">8.178</a></p>
 On 26</span> January<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2010,</span> DI Maberly spoke toa representative from<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Vodafone. She told DI Maberly
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that she did not confirm any numbers to Nick Davies.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref565" href="#footnote565">565</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-179"><a href="#para8-179" name="para8-179">8.179</a></p>
 On 1</span> February<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2010, the MPS receiveda request from Nick Davies under Freedom of
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Information Act 2000; this included requests for the total number of full names, partial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">names and initials including possible misspellings and duplications, which were listed on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">database and the total number of mobile phone numbers (full and partial).</span>

 On 9</span> February<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2010, Mr Yates wrote again to the Chairman of the CMS Committee and
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contended that during his evidence in September 2009 he had answered the questions as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fully as possible. He stated in that letter that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref566" href="#footnote566">566</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; Since that appearance, and in accordance with my initial press statement, I have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been attempting to ensure that the police have taken all proper, reasonable and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">diligent steps to inform all those individuals where there is any evidence that they may</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have been subject of any form of interception. This has involved considerable and time</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consuming work, in particular the use of an IT process previously unavailable. Even</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">now we cannot with any certainty answer questions relating to identifying individuals</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and whether or not they were a victim of interception &#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; whenever a name in whatever context was identified it was captured and put onto</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">an MPS system. The name could range from initials, single names right through to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">multiple variations and spellings of a host of fore and/or surnames. To even attempt to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">discern from the material to what extent this data refers to distinct individuals or for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what purpose would have required extensive work beyond the scope of the criminal</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation and would not have been a proportionate use of police resources.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A similar process would then have had to be undertaken to link phone numbers and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or voicemail messages to these individuals.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-181"><a href="#para8-181" name="para8-181">8.181</a></p>
 The latter paragraph indicates that the police had still failed to ascertain or recognise the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extent of the failure of the victim notification strategy despite having identified, initially at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">least, the importance of notifying all those whose privacy had potentially been invaded.</span>

 DCS Williams prepareda report entitled &#8220;Options</span> for Dealing with the potential<span style="font-weight:normal;"> &#8216;victims&#8217;
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issue&#8221;.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref567" href="#footnote567">567</a></sup> It is undated, but it is apparent from the content that it was drafted after the MPS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">received the request issued under the Freedom of Information Act but before the response</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which was dated 29 March 2010.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref568" href="#footnote568">568</a></sup> DCS Williams made reference to the fact that DI Maberly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had examined the 91 individuals whose names, mobile phone numbers and pin codes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appeared in the papers seized from Mr Mulcaire and identified 13 people who:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;will not have been contacted by us and potentially the service providers and from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the billing data provided as part of the original investigation, there are calls that are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">greater than 10 seconds (i.e. enough to enter the voicemail and listen to any message</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">left as per the criteria used for the trial)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Albeit not proved at an evidential level that interception has taken place, if the data</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is correct then there is a case for saying that for these individuals the possession of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">their name/mobile/pin has probably gone beyond more than merely preparatory and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">therefore there is suspicion that some form of &#8216;phone tapping&#8217; may have taken place.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The following are options for informing them.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">&#8220;Option 1</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Police try to contact these people using the mobile numbers listed by Mulcaire and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">tell them that they fall into this category.</span>



<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;If we did this I would suggest we are quite firm on saying that we are not investigating</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the case, we are simply carrying out John Yates&#8217; promise to inform people and if they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have any concerns to contact their service provider.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;If we cannot contact them, because the phone is now out of use or has moved on to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">someone else then that would be the end of the process on the basis that we have</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8216;been diligent, reasonable and sensible, and taken all proper steps.&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;Issues to consider: &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">This case is now nearly 4 years old, we are not carrying out an investigation and all</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the time we are spending public money on something that is not making anyone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">safer. At best we would be handing someone an opportunity to make personal gain</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">through the civil courts which does not assist the wider public good.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">It probably would [be] possible to undertake further enquiries beyond ringing the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">phone numbers to try to contact those individuals. A view might be that some of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">people are well known and it would have been &#8216;easy&#8217; to make contact. However, it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">might not be as easy as it seems, because we could be limited in terms of our full range</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of research methods as this is not an investigation and that could delay notification in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">some instances. Equally the more lengths we go to [to] contact individuals, potentially</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">through other people, we risk breaching their anonymity around this case, again for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">no great gain. Where is the balance of reasonableness?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">For some of the 13 we are not sure who they are/their relevance in terms of known</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">individuals.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">This is something that could be done immediately, before the Nick Davies FOIA letter</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">goes out.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">&#8220;Option 2</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We approach the service providers directly and/or through Jack Wraith (who originally</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">coordinated much of the contact/press lines with the service providers) and supply</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">them with details of these last few people and ask them to clarify whether or not they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have any concerns and make contact with the customer.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">&#8220;Issues to consider: &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">This would share the responsibility for determining who is a &#8216;victim&#8217; with the service</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">providers as it was the weaknesses in their system that has caused all this work for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">us and in theory if they had any concerns back in 2006 they should have contacted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">their customers.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">This would take an unknown time and it is important to send out the Nick Davies FOIA</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this week.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">&#8220;Option 3</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">We could complete Option 1 immediately and then consider pursuing the remainder</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">through option 2. If the combination of both did not make contact then that would be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">deemed reasonable and diligent.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The paper did not reach a conclusion as to which option should be selected.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-183"><a href="#para8-183" name="para8-183">8.183</a></p>
 It is not clear whether any further victims were informed following this paper being written,
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but it does indicate a clear lack of enthusiasm for informing any further potential victims,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">despite the undertaking given by Mr Yates in July the previous year. It appears to have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered to be a time consuming and expensive exercise for no real gain. There were to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be no further charges and one of the purposes of informing potential victims was to enable</span>
<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">them to take steps, if so advised, to seek whatever redress they saw fit: the enforcement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of privacy rights in the civil courts, therefore, did not appear to register with the police as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">worthwhile outcome. In the circumstances, the lack of appetite for ensuring that all potential</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">victims were informed was a misjudgement.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-184"><a href="#para8-184" name="para8-184">8.184</a></p>
 It was noted in the minutes ofa Gold Group meeting on 10</span> September<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2010 that DCS Williams
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was to provide a brief on the victim strategy to date. At a further meeting on 17 September</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010 the approach for dealing with &#8220;potential new victims&#8221; was discussed. It was recorded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that a strategy for new victims was being devised and that the proposed course was to write</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to each prospective victim and ask them to approach their service provider to see if they held</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any information to support their suspicion.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref569" href="#footnote569">569</a></sup> There was also an action point requiring DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Williams<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> provide</span><span style="font-style:italic"> details</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> JY</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> notifications</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> potential</span><span style="font-style:italic"> victims&#8221;</span> .</span>

<p id="para-id-8-185"><a href="#para8-185" name="para8-185">8.185</a></p>
 In October 2010, Nick Davies reported that he had contacted the mobile phone service
<span style="font-size: 15px;">providers and ascertained that not all the victims had been contacted. The MPS began asking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the service providers, in terms, which victims they had contacted and asking them to notify</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those not yet contacted. It is remarkable that this had still not been done, particularly given</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the earlier correspondence from the phone companies which indicated that O2 had notified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">customers but only at their own instigation and that Orange and Vodafone had not notified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any customers. The minutes of a Gold Group meeting held on 21 October 2010<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref570" href="#footnote570">570</a></sup> recorded</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">that DCS Williams had completed the previous action that he provide details to Mr Yates of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">notifications to potential victims and that there was an on-going action involving liaison by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams with the telephone companies to establish which victims they had informed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and cross-compare them with the list compiled by the MPS. The action continued:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;If</span><span style="font-style:italic"> victims</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">remain outstanding consideration of joint letter (MPS and telephone companies) to inform</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">them accordingly&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span></span>

<p id="para-id-8-186"><a href="#para8-186" name="para8-186">8.186</a></p>
 It was following this meeting that DCS Williams wrote to O2,</span> Everything Everywhere<span style="font-weight:normal;"> (formerly
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Orange) and Vodafone asking them whether those who they (the phone companies) had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identified as potential victims during the 2005 to 2006 investigation had been contacted.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref571" href="#footnote571">571</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He asked them, if they had not informed those potential victims, to make arrangements to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bring to their attention the information that suggested they might have been victims. He also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">asked them to provide those customers with the MPS single point of contact. It is noteworthy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that, even in this letter, DCS Williams was not verifying whether the original victim notification</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">strategy had been implemented because that would have required him to ask whether the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">phone companies had completed the two stages: that is to say, they had both identified all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">customers whose voicemail boxes had been dialled by the suspect numbers and then notified</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those customers.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-187"><a href="#para8-187" name="para8-187">8.187</a></p>
 On 2</span> November<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2010, Orange responded stating that no Orange customers had been
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contacted and that at no point during the investigation, or subsequently, had the MPS asked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Orange or T-Mobile to contact any potential victims.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref572" href="#footnote572">572</a></sup> The letter also stated:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Orange assisted the investigation by providing a list of mobile numbers that had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">been called by a set of telephone numbers supplied to us by the MPS. Orange has</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">no knowledge if those Orange mobiles were being called legitimately or with the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">intention of attempting to access their voicemail without authorisation. This was part</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the police investigation and for the MPS to identify.&#8221;</span>




<!--new page--><p id="para-id-8-188"><a href="#para8-188" name="para8-188">8.188</a></p>
 On 12</span> November<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2010,</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> O2</span> responded by<span style="font-weight:normal;"> saying:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref573" href="#footnote573">573</a></sup>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I can confirm that the O2 customers identified in 2006 by us as potential victims of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">voicemail interception were contacted at the time and given advice &#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-189"><a href="#para8-189" name="para8-189">8.189</a></p>
 Finally,</span> on<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 22</span> November<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2010,</span> Vodafone dealt with the enquiry in the following<span style="font-weight:normal;"> terms:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref574" href="#footnote574">574</a></sup>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I am surprised that you say that you thought at the time of the investigation that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;all of the people potentially identified as being &#8216;victims&#8217; had been &#8216;contacted&#8217; by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Service Providers, including Vodafone. Whilst we were able to furnish the police</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with information and data requested, it is not for Vodafone to determine who is a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;potential victim&#8221; in a police led investigation &#8230; This is something for the police to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">establish and it is for the police to take such steps to inform potential victims of crime</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as they deem appropriate, which I accept could have included asking Vodafone to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contact a given list of customers &#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;A search of our files in relation to the matter has not revealed any request from your</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">officers that we do otherwise&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-190"><a href="#para8-190" name="para8-190">8.190</a></p>
 The police thereafter identified that in fact 58</span> people out of the list of<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 91 names with PIN

<span style="font-size: 15px;">numbers associated had not yet been contacted.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-191"><a href="#para8-191" name="para8-191">8.191</a></p>
 As regards this failure of this second attempt to ensure that all potential victims had been
<span style="font-size: 15px;">informed, Mr Yates said that the exercise had been conducted with the very best intentions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but that it was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;fairly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> torturous&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref575" href="#footnote575">575</a></sup> Mr Yates accepted responsibility for its failure and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained it as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref576" href="#footnote576">576</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; the day-to-day management of the exercise to place all documentation on the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Holmes computer was not at the level I expected or that was required. This resulted</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in some material not being placed on the system which resulted in incomplete or</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">incorrect responses to a number of people who were affected. This is a matter of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">great personal regret.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-192"><a href="#para8-192" name="para8-192">8.192</a></p>
 It should be noted,</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> however, that the process of scanning the documents in order to createa
<span style="font-size: 15px;">searchable database was not implemented to assist in positively identifying individuals who</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had not been informed but who should have been; rather it was to respond to individual</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requests for information from people who wanted confirmation whether or not they were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">potential victims. I find that the MPS (and, in particular, Mr Yates, DCS Williams and DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Surtees) failed to take effective steps, at any time before November 2010, to ensure that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those potential victims who had not been informed were informed as soon as practicable.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">They failed even to realise that the victim notification strategy had failed or the extent of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its failure until Orange and Vodafone spelled out in terms that they had not notified their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">customers, nor been asked to do so. These failings on the part of the police are difficult to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explain. The most likely explanation in my judgment is that the officers concerned did not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">look beyond the assumption that it had worked, at least substantially. Once more, however,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there is no evidential basis for inferring that the police approach was influenced in any way</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by relationships with NI.</span>




<!--new page--><p id="para-id-8-193"><a href="#para8-193" name="para8-193">8.193</a></p>
 It is worthwhile briefly to revisit the failure to identify that Lord Prescott wasa potential
<span style="font-size: 15px;">victim. By letter dated 15 December 2009, he was eventually informed by the Directorate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Legal Services at the MPS that he was a &#8220;person of interest&#8221; to Mr Mulcaire in that there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was a piece of paper containing the words &#8220;John Prescott&#8221; and &#8220;Hull&#8221;, and two self-billing tax</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">invoices dated 7 and 21 May 2006, addressed to News International Supply Company Limited</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and containing the words<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Story</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8211;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Other</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Prescott</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Assist</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8211;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> TXT&#8221;</span> and<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Story</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8211;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Other</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Prescott</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">his adviser, her phone numbers and her pass codes, which had been discovered in the short</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">space of time after Mr Mulcaire&#8217;s arrest but before his interview. Mr Yates attributed the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">failure to indexing problems on the HOLMES database:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref578" href="#footnote578">578</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think what happened, and I say &#8211; and I&#8217;ve absolutely stated this in my statement</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and accepted it, that there was an indexing issue around the name John Prescott</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">being linked to his &#8211; I think it was his adviser, whose name I would never have known</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or could never &#8211; I don&#8217;t think anyone could have made the link, to be honest &#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-194"><a href="#para8-194" name="para8-194">8.194</a></p>
 This is not,</span> however, the complete answer. In his<span style="font-weight:normal;"> evidence, Mr Yates stressed with some force
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he checked on a number of occasions whether there was evidence that Lord Prescott had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been a victim and that he always received the same answer, upon which he understandably</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relied<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref579" href="#footnote579">579</a></sup> . He emphasised:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref580" href="#footnote580">580</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; I cannot tell you the amount of times I checked and sought further and better</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">particulars about the possibility that Mr Prescott&#8217;s phone had been interfered with. It</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">would be literally scores &#8211; over the following months ...&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He continued:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref581" href="#footnote581">581</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; Because I was so concerned, the idea of misleading the Deputy Prime Minister is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not something I&#8217;d relish and I was absolutely desperate to get to the bottom if there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was something there.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-195"><a href="#para8-195" name="para8-195">8.195</a></p>
 DCS Williams has said that he briefed Mr Yates to the best of his ability; that he does not
<span style="font-size: 15px;">believe that all the material came to light until it had been scanned onto the HOLMES system</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">some months later; and that he ensured that he showed Mr Yates all the material as it became</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">available, including references to Tracey Temple. For the reasons explained above, I make no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">finding as to precisely what was brought to the attention of Mr Yates but, to say the very</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">least, it is disappointing that what was inferred by the interviewing detectives within hours</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the material being seized was not more clearly communicated to Mr Yates as he was being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pressed by the Deputy Prime Minister.</span>

<h3>The PCC response</h3>

<p id="para-id-8-196"><a href="#para8-196" name="para8-196">8.196</a></p>
 Although this will be discussed later in this Report,</span> as part of this<span style="font-weight:normal;"> narrative, it is worth including
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the response of the PCC. On 9 July 2009 the following statement was issued:</span>





<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The PCC has previously made clear that it finds the practice of phone message</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">tapping deplorable. Any suggestion that further transgressions have occurred since</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">its report was published in 2007 will be investigated without delay. In the meantime,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the PCC is contacting the Guardian newspaper and Information Commissioner for any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">further specific information in relation to the claims, published today about the older</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">cases, which suggest the Commission has been misled at any stage of its inquiries into</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">these matters.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-197"><a href="#para8-197" name="para8-197">8.197</a></p>
 The PCC was concerned about two issues:</span> whether it had been misled during its<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2007
<span style="font-size: 15px;">inquiry and whether its recommendations to the industry to help prevent any repetition of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the criminal activity had failed. It launched a further investigation, taking evidence from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW, the Guardian and the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref582" href="#footnote582">582</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-198"><a href="#para8-198" name="para8-198">8.198</a></p>
 On 27</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009</span> the PCC wrote to Mr Myler askinga number of<span style="font-weight:normal;"> questions, including the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">following:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref583" href="#footnote583">583</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Does it remain your position that the illegal behaviour of Clive Goodman was a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rogue exception and that no other journalists or executives of the newspaper were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">aware of the practice of phone message tapping by anyone employed by the paper?&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-199"><a href="#para8-199" name="para8-199">8.199</a></p>
 In his letter of response dated 5</span> August<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009 Mr Myler stated that the allegations in the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Guardian were<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> just</span><span style="font-style:italic"> unsubstantiated</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> irresponsible,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> they</span><span style="font-style:italic"> were</span><span style="font-style:italic"> wholly</span><span style="font-style:italic"> false.&#8221;</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref584" href="#footnote584">584</a></sup> In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">response to the particular question quoted in the paragraph above he said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref585" href="#footnote585">585</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Our internal enquiries have found no evidence of involvement by News of the World</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">staff other than Clive Goodman in phone message interception beyond the e-mail</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">transcript which emerged in April 2008 during the Gordon Taylor litigation and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">which has since been revealed in the original Guardian report. That email was dated</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">June 29 2005 and consisted of a transcript of voicemails from the phone of Gordon</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Taylor and another person which had apparently been recorded by Glenn Mulcaire.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The email and transcript were created by a junior reporter (who has since left the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspaper). When questioned after the email was supplied to us by Gordon Taylor&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">lawyers in April 2008, the junior reporter accepted that he had created the relevant</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">email document but had no recollection of it beyond that. Since by the end of June</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2005 he had been a reporter for only a week or so (having been promoted &#8216;off the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">floor&#8217; where he had been a messenger) and since the first months of his reporting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">career consisted largely of transcribing tapes for other people, his lack of recollection</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">when questioned three years later is perhaps understandable.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Email searches of relevant people &#8230; failed to show any trace of the email being sent</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to or received by any other News of the World staff member.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Those who might have been connected to the relevant story &#8230; denied ever having</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">seen or knowing about the relevant email and no evidence has been found which</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contradicts these assertions&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-200"><a href="#para8-200" name="para8-200">8.200</a></p>
 Mr Myler was asked during his evidence whether his internal enquiries had in fact
<span style="font-size: 15px;">demonstrated that the allegation made by the Guardian that there had been hacking into</span>




<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">thousands of mobile phones was unsubstantiated and irresponsible. He was asked to put to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one side what the police might or might not have found. Mr Myler responded as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref586" href="#footnote586">586</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t have any direct information that our internal enquiries had gone to that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">point, and as I said earlier, one of the things that weighed heavily with me when</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I came in was the fact that the police hadn&#8217;t interviewed anybody else other than</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Goodman in their enquiries.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-201"><a href="#para8-201" name="para8-201">8.201</a></p>
 To the suggestion that,</span> when making this assertion to the<span style="font-weight:normal;"> PCC, he had not relied on any
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information that he had obtained through internal enquiries Mr Myler said:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Other than the appeal that Mr Goodman &#8211; I had to conduct with the head of human</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">resources and the allegations that he made, and then talking to those individuals</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who he made allegations against. There was no evidence provided to me to support</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what the Guardian had said at all.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-202"><a href="#para8-202" name="para8-202">8.202</a></p>
 It was put to Mr Myler that his evidence had been that after June 2008 he no longer believed
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the single rogue reporter defence (on the basis that it was untenable after the &#8220;for Neville&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">email was discovered) but that in this letter to the PCC he was effectively stating that there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was no evidence which went beyond Mr Goodman and therefore that the single rogue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reporter defence was true. He said:</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, the rogue reporter defence failed to hold once the &#8216;for Neville&#8217; email was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">discovered. And I made that clear to the Select Committee I think in July of 2009, I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think it was, about its significance&#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;But &#8211; yes, and that clearly, perhaps, was an error, because this letter was dated 5</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">August and I&#8217;d appeared before the Select Committee in the month previously. So I&#8217;m</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sure that the PCC were aware of that, if that &#8211; clearly that was following my evidence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the Select Committee, which was very heavily covered.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-203"><a href="#para8-203" name="para8-203">8.203</a></p>
I am afraid thatI find this response was unconvincing. It is not and cannot be acceptable for
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Myler to rely on the evidence he gave to the Select Committee to support the proposition</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the PCC would not have been misled by an entirely contradictory assertion that was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contained in his response to them. On any showing, what he said to the PCC was neither full</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nor frank.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-204"><a href="#para8-204" name="para8-204">8.204</a></p>
 In addition, Mr Myler told the PCC that the process of internal investigation had been rigorous
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that News Group had instructed Burton Copeland, an independent firm of solicitors,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to deal with further police inquiries after the arrests of Mr Mulcaire and Mr Goodman. He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">claimed that Burton Copeland were given:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref587" href="#footnote587">587</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;every financial document which could possibly be relevant to the paper&#8217;s dealings</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with Mulcaire, and they confirmed that &#8216;they could find no evidence from these</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">documents or their other enquiries which suggested complicity by the News of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">World or other members of its staff beyond Clive Goodman in criminal activities&#8217;.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-205"><a href="#para8-205" name="para8-205">8.205</a></p>
 This is the most that the Inquiry has been told about the work carried out by Burton Copeland
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given that NI has not waived legal professional privilege. As referred to<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref588" href="#footnote588">588</a></sup> there is no available</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information about what documents were given to Burton Copeland (beyond certain limited</span>



<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">financial documentation); what sources of information they were able to access; the precise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terms of their instruction; what investigations they made; or what, if any, caveats surrounded</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their conclusions. As a result, the reliance by Mr Myler on their work is hardly persuasive.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-206"><a href="#para8-206" name="para8-206">8.206</a></p>
 Among its conclusions,</span> the PCC found as<span style="font-weight:normal;"> follows:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref589" href="#footnote589">589</a></sup>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;While people may speculate about the email referencing &#8216;Neville&#8217;, the Taylor</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">settlement, and the termination payments to Mulcaire and Goodman, the PCC can</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">only deal with the facts that are available rather than make assumptions. The PCC</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">has seen no new evidence to suggest that the practice of phone message tapping was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">undertaken by others beyond Goodman and Mulcaire, or evidence that News of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">World executives knew about Goodman and Mulcaire&#8217;s activities. It follows that there</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">is nothing to suggest that the PCC was materially misled during its 2007 inquiry.&#8221;</span>

<h3>The CMS Committee reaction</h3>

<p id="para-id-8-207"><a href="#para8-207" name="para8-207">8.207</a></p>
 The CMS Committee considered that the Guardian article cast doubt on the evidence they had
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been given by NI executives in 2007 and so reopened the hearings in the inquiry (launched in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">November 2008) into press standards, privacy and libel; the purpose was to examine whether</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was any evidence of a widespread conspiracy at the NoTW. The Committee heard</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence from representatives of the Guardian, the PCC, the Information Commissioner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the MPS as well as from then current and former NI executives. It also received written</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence from the DPP and Mark Lewis, the solicitor who acted for Gordon Taylor. The NI</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">witnesses comprised Tom Crone, Colin Myler, Andy Coulson, Stuart Kuttner and Les Hinton.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Committee also invited Glenn Mulcaire, Clive Goodman, Neville Thurlbeck and Rebecca</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Brooks to give evidence but all declined (save for Mr Thurlbeck who was prepared to give</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence but only in private). The Committee decided not to use its powers of compulsion for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasons of<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;time</span><span style="font-style:italic"> and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> practicality&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref590" href="#footnote590">590</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-208"><a href="#para8-208" name="para8-208">8.208</a></p>
 In giving evidence to the Committee, NI witnesses continued to assert that Mr Goodman had
<span style="font-size: 15px;">acted alone. Mr Hinton told the Committee:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref591" href="#footnote591">591</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There was never any evidence delivered to me that suggested that the conduct of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Clive Goodman spread beyond him.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-209"><a href="#para8-209" name="para8-209">8.209</a></p>
 In response to questions suggesting that termination payments to Mr Mulcaire and Mr
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Goodman could be interpreted as an attempt to prevent them speaking out about practices</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the newspaper, Mr Hinton said he had authorised the payments on the advice of specialist</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">employment lawyers.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-210"><a href="#para8-210" name="para8-210">8.210</a></p>
 Mr Coulson told the Committee that during his time as editor he<span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> &#8220;never</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> condoned</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> the</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> use</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">phone hacking&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> and</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> did</span><span style="font-style:normal"> not</span><span style="font-style:normal"> have</span> &#8220;any recollection of incidences where phone hacking</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">took place&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref592" href="#footnote592">592</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> He</span><span style="font-style:normal"> said:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref593" href="#footnote593">593</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;WhatwehadwiththeClive Goodmancasewasareporterwhodeceivedthemanaging</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">editor&#8217;s office and, in turn, deceived me. I have thought long and hard about this (I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">did when I left): what could I have done to have stopped this from happening? But if</span>





<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a rogue reporter decides to behave in that fashion I am not sure that there is an awful</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">lot more I could have done.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When asked whether he commissioned an enquiry when he found out about the arrests, Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Coulson said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref594" href="#footnote594">594</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Yes. Obviously we wanted to know internally very quickly what the hell had gone on.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Then I brought in Burton Copeland, an independent firm of solicitors to carry out an</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation. We opened up the files as much as we could. There was nothing that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they asked for that they were not given.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-211"><a href="#para8-211" name="para8-211">8.211</a></p>
 Mr Coulson did concede that Burton Copeland were tasked<span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> &#8220;with</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> the</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> primary</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> purpose,</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> I</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to say, of trying to find out what happened in relation to Clive&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref595" href="#footnote595">595</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-8-212"><a href="#para8-212" name="para8-212">8.212</a></p>
 On the remit of the internal investigations Mr Myler said:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref596" href="#footnote596">596</a></sup>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;My recollection was that a very thorough investigation took place where there was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a review of everything from how cash payments were processed &#8230;&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">When asked about the width of the internal enquiry Mr Crone gave the following account:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref597" href="#footnote597">597</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; By the time I got back, which must have been August 15, Burton Copeland were in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the office virtually every day or in contact with the office every day. My understanding</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of their remit was that they were brought in to go over everything and find out what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">had gone on, to liaise with the police &#8230; What I think was being enquired into was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what had gone on leading to the arrests; what, in the relationship with Mulcaire, did</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we have to worry about. Burton Copeland came in; they were given absolutely free-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">range to ask whatever they wanted to ask. They did risk accounts and they have got</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">four lever-arch files of payment records, everything to do with Mulcaire, and there is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">no evidence of anything going beyond in terms of knowledge into other activities.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-213"><a href="#para8-213" name="para8-213">8.213</a></p>
 Again, these assertions cannot be tested because legal professional privilege has not been
<span style="font-size: 15px;">waived in relation to the instructions given to Burton Copeland, the material provided, or,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indeed, any aspect of the work done. I do no more than record what Mr Crone said.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-214"><a href="#para8-214" name="para8-214">8.214</a></p>
 The Committee concluded,</span> in their report published on<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 24</span> February<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2010,</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> that:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref598" href="#footnote598">598</a></sup>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Evidence we have seen makes it inconceivable that no-one else at the News of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">World, bar Clive Goodman, knew about the phone-hacking &#8230; We cannot believe that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the newspaper&#8217;s newsroom was so out of control for this to be the case.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-215"><a href="#para8-215" name="para8-215">8.215</a></p>
 The Committee also noted that the newspaper&#8217;s</span> enquiries had been far from<span style="font-weight:normal;"> &#8220;full&#8221; or
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;vigorous&#8221;, as it &#8211; and the PCC &#8211; had been assured. It was struck by the<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;collective</span><span style="font-style:italic"> amnesia</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">afflicting witnesses from the News of the World&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref599" href="#footnote599">599</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> It</span><span style="font-style:normal"> concluded</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref600" href="#footnote600">600</a></sup></span>







<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;a culture undoubtedly did exist it the newsroom of the News of the World and other</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapers at the time which at best turned a blind eye to illegal activities such as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">phone-hacking and blagging and at worst actively condoned it &#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-216"><a href="#para8-216" name="para8-216">8.216</a></p>
 The determination of NI to maintaina line that the editor and the legal director believed was
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not true in the face of two investigations by the CMS Committee and two investigations by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC is extraordinary and, at the very least, a demonstration of loyalty to the NoTW and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its reputation which says a great deal about the culture of the paper (to say nothing of its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">practices and its approach to ethical propriety). In fact, the NoTW maintained the &#8220;one rogue</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reporter&#8221; defence until the Spring of 2011 when three NoTW journalists were arrested as</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">part of Operation Weeting.</span>

<p id="para-id-8-217"><a href="#para8-217" name="para8-217">8.217</a></p>
 The Committee also considered the actions of the MPS.</span> On<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2</span> September<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009, Mr Yates
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and DCS Williams gave evidence to the CMS Committee. Mr Yates told the Committee that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the approach during the investigation had been that an offence under s1 RIPA 2000 was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">committed only where the messages intercepted had not previously been listened to by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intended recipient. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref601" href="#footnote601">601</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Our job, as ever, is to follow the evidence and to make considered decisions based</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">upon our experience which ensures limited resources are used both wisely and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">effectively and, supported by senior counsel, including the DPP, the collective belief is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that there were then and there remain now insufficient grounds or evidence to arrest</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">or interview anyone else and, as I have said already, no additional evidence has come</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">to light since.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-218"><a href="#para8-218" name="para8-218">8.218</a></p>
 Mr Yates described his July 2009</span> review in the following<span style="font-weight:normal;"> terms:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref602" href="#footnote602">602</a></sup>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; I considered the approach adopted by the prosecution team in their papers, what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were they actually focused on, and it was those eight cases. I considered the amount</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of complexities and challenges around the evidence then and what evidence would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be available now, particular in relation to the availability of the data. I considered the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">level of disclosure and who would review the material. In this case senior counsel had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reviewed the material. I considered how the case was opened after the guilty pleas.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I considered whether there was anything new in the Guardian articles in terms of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">additional evidence, and I considered finally our approach to the victims, how they</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were managed and dealt with and the impact of further inquiries, if they had been</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">necessary, on them, and I came to the view, and I appreciate you all thought it was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">rather quick, that there was no new evidence in this case. It was a conflation of three</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">old stories.&#8221;</span>

 He said of the Guardian article that:
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;there is essentially nothing new in the story other than to place in the public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">domain additional material which had already been considered by both the police</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation into Goodman and Mulcaire and by the CPS and the prosecution team.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">There was certainly no new evidence and, in spite of a huge amount of publicity and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">our own request of the Guardian and others to submit to us any additional evidence,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nothing has been forthcoming since.&#8221;</span>


<!--new page--><p id="para-id-8-220"><a href="#para8-220" name="para8-220">8.220</a></p>
A key conclusion of the Committee was that the police had been wrong not to investigate
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further the contract or the &#8220;for Neville&#8221; email and that the reasons given on behalf of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MPS were not adequate:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref603" href="#footnote603">603</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In 2006 the Metropolitan Police made a considered choice, based on available</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">resources, not to investigate either the holding contract between Greg Miskiw</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and Glenn Mulcaire, or the &#8216;for Neville&#8217; email. We have been told that choice was</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">endorsed by the CPS. Nevertheless it is our view that the decision was a wrong one.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">The email was a strong indication both of additional lawbreaking and of the possible</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">involvement of others. These matters merited thorough police investigation, and the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">first steps to be taken seem to us to have been obvious. The Metropolitan Police&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reasons for not doing so seem to us to be inadequate.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-8-221"><a href="#para8-221" name="para8-221">8.221</a></p>
 As regard the PCC,</span> the Committee found as<span style="font-weight:normal;"> follows:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref604" href="#footnote604">604</a></sup>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We accept that in 2007 the PCC acted in good faith to follow up the implications of the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">convictions of Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire. The Guardian&#8217;s fresh revelations</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in July 2009, however, provided good reason for the PCC to be more assertive in its</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">enquiries, rather than accepting submissions from the News of the World once again</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">at face value. This Committee has not done so and we find the conclusions in the PCC&#8217;s</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">November report simplistic and surprising. It has certainly not fully, or forensically,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">considered all the evidence to this inquiry.&#8221;</span>

<h2>9. September 2010: The New York Times</h2>

<p id="para-id-9-1"><a href="#para9-1" name="para9-1">9.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 1 September 2010 the New York Times published an article entitled<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Tabloid</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Hack</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Attack</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on Royals, and Beyond&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref605" href="#footnote605">605</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> The</span><span style="font-style:normal"> article</span><span style="font-style:normal"> reported</span><span style="font-style:normal"> that,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> in</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> summer</span><span style="font-style:normal"> of</span><span style="font-style:normal"> 2010,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> five</span><span style="font-style:normal"> people</span><span style="font-style:normal"> had</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">issued claims alleging that the NoTW had been intercepting their voicemail messages; it also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">referred to the judicial review of the handling by the MPS of the investigation. The article</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">claimed that:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The litigation is beginning to expose just how far the hacking went, something</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that Scotland Yard did not do. In fact, an examination based on police records, court</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">documents and interviews with investigators and reporters show that Britain&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">revered police agency failed to pursue leads suggesting that one of the country&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">most powerful newspapers was routinely listening in on its citizens.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The police had seized files from Mulcaire&#8217;s home in 2006 that contained several</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">thousand mobile phone numbers of potential hacking victims and 91 mobile phone</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">PIN codes. Scotland Yard even had a recording of Mulcaire walking one journalist &#8211;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">who may have worked at yet another tabloid &#8211; step by step through the hacking of a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">soccer official&#8217;s voice mail, according to a copy of the tape. But Scotland Yard focused</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">almost exclusively on the royals case, which culminated with the imprisonment of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire and Goodman. When police officials presented evidence to prosecutors,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they didn&#8217;t discuss crucial clues that the two men may not have been alone in hacking</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the voice mail messages of story targets.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-2"><a href="#para9-2" name="para9-2">9.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The article also reported that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;several</span><span style="font-style:italic"> investigators&#8221;</span> had said in interviews that the MPS was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reluctant to conduct a wider inquiry in part because of its close relationship with the NoTW.</span>



<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">It reported that during interviews with more than a dozen reporters and editors at the NoTW</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">claims were made that voicemail interception was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;an</span><span style="font-style:italic"> industry-wide</span><span style="font-style:italic"> thing&#8221;</span> , that<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Every</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hack</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) That in the documents seized from Mr Mulcaire there were at least three names of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other NoTW journalists.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) That the MPS had a symbiotic relationship with the NoTW:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;The</span><span style="font-style:italic"> police</span><span style="font-style:italic"> sometimes</span><span style="font-style:italic"> built</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">high-profile cases out of the paper&#8217;s exclusives, and News of the World reciprocated</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with fawning stories of arrests&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) The MPS detectives had faced pressure from within their own organisation and were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reminded of the<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;long-term</span><span style="font-style:italic"> relationship</span><span style="font-style:italic"> with</span><span style="font-style:italic"> News</span><span style="font-style:italic"> International&#8221;</span> .</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) The MPS did not discuss certain evidence with the CPS, including the notes which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suggested the involvement of other reporters.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) By<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;sitting</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on&#8221;</span> the evidence for so long, the MPS had made it impossible to get</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information from phone companies, which do not keep records indefinitely.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">(f) By only notifying a small proportion of those whose phones may have been illegally</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accessed, the MPS had effectively shielded the NoTW from a large number of civil</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">actions.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-3"><a href="#para9-3" name="para9-3">9.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 3 September 2010 one of the reporters quoted in the New York Times article, Sean Hoare,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was interviewed on BBC Radio 4. He repeated the expression<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> dark</span><span style="font-style:italic"> arts&#8221;</span> and said that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;phone hacking&#8221; was endemic in the industry. He made clear allegations which, in order to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">avoid prejudice to the ongoing investigation, are not repeated here.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-4"><a href="#para9-4" name="para9-4">9.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Given the resurgence of the allegations and the additional detail provided by the New</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">York Times and Mr Hoare, Mr Yates should have reflected carefully on the exercise that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he conducted in 2009 and reviewed, in more depth, what evidence was gathered during</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Caryatid and what it might show. Once again, however, he failed to engage with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the substance of what was alleged. He did not, as he should have done, revert to DCS Williams</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and DCS Surtees and ask them for full details of what the<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;crucial</span><span style="font-style:italic"> clues&#8221;</span> or leads might be that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">indicated that Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire were not acting alone or ask them to explain</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fully what indications there might be that the three named journalists had been involved in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the conspiracy. It is quite clear that having made the dogmatic and over-hasty decision on 9</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">July 2009, he then failed to assess anything that might conceivably challenge the correctness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of his initial decision with anything approaching an open mind. It remained the case that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Yates was not prepared to entertain the possibility that there was anything in the vast</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">quantity of documentation held by the police, that had not been analysed, that could itself</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">generate lines of enquiry; he was interested only in the question of whether the New York</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Times could itself produce evidence.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-5"><a href="#para9-5" name="para9-5">9.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 5 September 2010 Mr Yates issued a press statement which included the following:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref606" href="#footnote606">606</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The New York Times contacted the MPS about their investigation. Our stance remains</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as before. We have repeatedly asked them for any new material that they have for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">us to consider. We were never made aware of the material from Sean Hoare before</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the article&#8217;s publication. We have sought additional information from them and will</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consider this material, along with Sean Hoare&#8217;s recent BBC Radio interview, and will</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consult the CPS on how best to progress it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-6"><a href="#para9-6" name="para9-6">9.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Yates also took the opportunity to re-state the lack of evidence that Lord Prescott had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been a victim:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Separately, we are aware of the current claims in the media from, amongst others,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Lord Prescott about his view that his phone was hacked. There remains to this day no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">evidence that his phone was hacked by either Mulcaire or Goodman. This is a matter</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of public record.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-7"><a href="#para9-7" name="para9-7">9.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 6 September 2010 Mr Yates chaired a Gold Group meeting. Neither DCS Williams nor DCS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Surtees were invited to the meeting. The terms of reference for the Gold Group<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref607" href="#footnote607">607</a></sup> were stated</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to be:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;To</span><span style="font-style:italic"> provide</span><span style="font-style:italic"> ACPO</span><span style="font-style:italic"> oversight</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> various</span><span style="font-style:italic"> MPS</span><span style="font-style:italic"> strands</span><span style="font-style:italic"> relating</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;phone</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hacking&#8217;&#8221;</span> .</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The strands were listed and included<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;New</span><span style="font-style:italic"> information</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> public</span><span style="font-style:italic"> domain</span><span style="font-style:italic"> by</span><span style="font-style:italic"> ex</span><span style="font-style:italic"> News</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;JY explained that the purpose of the actions required was to seek clarity as to whether</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there was any new evidence amongst the recent media reporting before making any</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">further decision. This is not, at this stage, a further investigation. DSupt Haydon (as</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">ACSO&#8217;s former Staff Officer) will lead this separate and independent effort to clarify</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">the above.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-8"><a href="#para9-8" name="para9-8">9.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Action points required Detective Superintendent Haydon (who had been appointed SIO) to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">review the transcripts of different statements in the public domain, liaise with the CPS to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">discuss any new material that might come to light and consider interviewing Sharon Marshall</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the statements made in her book. There was also an action point for Mr Yates to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">consult the DPP or an appropriate deputy. Late in the evening of 6 September 2010, Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Yates made contact with the CPS. According to the Chief Crown Prosecutor for London, to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whom he spoke, Mr Yates said that he wanted to update Mr Starmer and let him know that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he (Mr Yates) did not intend to reopen the investigation but merely to clarify what had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">said in the New York Times article by inviting the journalists to provide their material and by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interviewing Sean Hoare; thereafter, they might then seek the advice of the CPS.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-9"><a href="#para9-9" name="para9-9">9.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 8 September 2010 D/Supt Haydon sent an email to the CPS setting out the action the MPS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was proposing to take following the article. In his email he said that he had been asked:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref609" href="#footnote609">609</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;to clarify the new information in the public domain (since 1st September 2010) to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">establish if there is any new evidence in the phone hacking case &#8230; I wish to make it</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">clear that I am not reinvestigating the original case so knowledge of the case and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">retrieving case papers is not necessary.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-10"><a href="#para9-10" name="para9-10">9.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 9 September 2010, Mr Yates convened a Gold Group meeting to agree current actions.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">D/Supt Haydon was directed to define the terms of reference for the work being undertaken</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">andextendtheremittocoveradditionalindividualswhowerecomingforward.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref610" href="#footnote610">610</a></sup> Theexercise,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although stated not to be an investigation, was subsequently given the name Operation Varec</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the following terms of reference:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref611" href="#footnote611">611</a></sup></span>





<a name="page403"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;To assess whether allegations being made in the media since 1st September 2010</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">communications, at News of the World, in 2005/2006.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-11"><a href="#para9-11" name="para9-11">9.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At a meeting of the Gold Group on 10 September 2010, it was noted that the new witnesses,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">who had been identified by the New York Times article, would need to be approached as part</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Operation Varec. D/Supt Haydon informed those present that the New York Times had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been asked for their material.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref612" href="#footnote612">612</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-9-12"><a href="#para9-12" name="para9-12">9.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At around this time, D/Supt Haydon asked a HOLMES supervisor to carry out a search on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the HOLMES database for evidence that Lord Prescott had been targeted by Mr Mulcaire.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In an email dated 10 September 2010,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref613" href="#footnote613">613</a></sup> he was informed by that supervisor that the name</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;John Prescott&#8221; appeared on p183 of seven notepads seized from Mr Mulcaire and that word</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;PRE A&#8221;appearedonceinhandwrittennotes.Thereferencesto&#8220;JLPresetPIN3333&#8221;and&#8220;JLP&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">information, they related to Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton. He was also informed that there were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no results for searches on popular media nick-names for Lord Prescott. It appears that Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prescott was not given this information, but it is right to repeat that, in December 2009, he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been informed that his name and other details appeared in the Mulcaire documents.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-13"><a href="#para9-13" name="para9-13">9.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Reverting to the position of the CPS, following the publication of the New York Times article,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Starmer quickly took stock of what action he needed to take. Mr Starmer explained that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref614" href="#footnote614">614</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Whilst respecting the views of David Perry QC and Louis Mably, I had in fact had</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">concerns for some time about the emphatic view of the construction of sections 1</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and 2 of RIPA that had been articulated by Mr Perry QC in 2009 and adopted by me</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in my letters and evidence to the CMS committee. I therefore decided that it would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be sensible to look again at the matter, particularly since it appeared that the CPS</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">might be required to give the MPS advice in relation to the allegations in the New</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">York Times.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-14"><a href="#para9-14" name="para9-14">9.14</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the result, Mr Starmer decided to commission two written advices: the first was to be from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">original counsel, who would be asked to consider the original papers and give a definitive</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view of the approach taken to s1 of RIPA in 2006 to 2007; the second advice was sought from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fresh counsel, Mr Mark Heywood QC, who had had no previous connection to the case.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-15"><a href="#para9-15" name="para9-15">9.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The DPP received the written advice from Mr Perry on 14 September 2010.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref615" href="#footnote615">615</a></sup> Having this time</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had the opportunity to consider the papers, Mr Perry concluded that for purposes of the 2006</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecution it had not in fact been necessary to resolve the question of whether or not s1 of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">RIPA required proof that the interception had taken place before the intended recipient had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accessed the message (given that Mr Mulcaire had pleaded guilty to the indictment). Having</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">refreshed his memory from the papers, Mr Perry stated that the oral advice he gave in 2006</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been that the proper construction of RIPA was a difficult issue, with tenable arguments</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">either way; and that a narrow approach to the construction of RIPA had not limited the scope</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the police investigation.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-16"><a href="#para9-16" name="para9-16">9.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Upon receipt of this advice Mr Starmer was naturally concerned that this did not fully</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">correspond with what he had been told in 2009, which itself had been the basis of his letters</span>




<a name="page404"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">and evidence to the CMS committee. Mr Perry was therefore instructed to advise to whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the &#8220;for Neville&#8221; email should now be viewed in a different way in the light of his more recent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advice. On 16 September 2010, Mr Perry provided a note<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref616" href="#footnote616">616</a></sup> in which he confirmed that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">construction of RIPA set out in his advice written 18 months earlier had been taken from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">note drafted by DCS Williams. He also made it clear that his conclusions in relation to the &#8220;for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Neville&#8221; email remained unchanged.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-17"><a href="#para9-17" name="para9-17">9.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 17 September 2010, the DPP received written advice from Mr Heywood.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref617" href="#footnote617">617</a></sup> In a sustained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and sophisticated analysis of the competing legal arguments, Mr Heywood inclined to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">view that the broader construction of RIPA was to be preferred, having regard to the purpose</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">underpinning the legislation and additional materials sent to him by First Parliamentary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Counsel. Mr Heywood added that, in any event, even if the narrow interpretation should turn</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out to be correct, it would make no difference to investigators, because the inchoate offences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of conspiracy or attempt would be unaffected by a narrow construction of the legislation.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-18"><a href="#para9-18" name="para9-18">9.18</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In his subsequent dealings with Parliamentary Select Committees, Mr Starmer no longer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">adhered to a narrow interpretation of RIPA: in essence, he indicated that the approach he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intended to adopt would be to advise the police and CPS prosecutors to proceed on the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assumption that a court<span style="font-style:italic"> might</span> adopt a wide interpretation of sections 1 and 2 of RIPA.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-19"><a href="#para9-19" name="para9-19">9.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 1 October 2010, D/Supt Haydon and another officer had a meeting with Simon Clements</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Asker Hussain of the CPS. D/Supt Haydon provided a detailed update on the progress of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Varec.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref618" href="#footnote618">618</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-9-20"><a href="#para9-20" name="para9-20">9.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 4 October 2010, The Dispatches programme, &#8220;Tabloids, Tories and Telephone Hacking&#8221;,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reported allegations that the NoTW had been involved in the unlawful interception of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail messages. Following this programme, D/Supt Haydon wrote to Colin Myler asking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">him to provide relevant material including transcripts of telephone calls or emails that may</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be related to unlawful interception and a full list of the names of employees who worked on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the &#8216;Features&#8217; or &#8216;News&#8217; desks for the period 2005 to 2006.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref619" href="#footnote619">619</a></sup> Mr Myler replied on 13 October</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2010, stating:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref620" href="#footnote620">620</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I am aware of the allegations made in the Dispatches programme, concerning</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">telephone voicemail accessing in 2005-2006. However, I am as sure as I can be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that since I became editor of the News of the World in January 2007 neither the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspaper nor its staff have collected or obtained information by means of unlawful</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">interception. Similarly, I am as sure as I can be that neither the newspaper nor its staff</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">are in possession of such material whenever it may have originally been collected.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-21"><a href="#para9-21" name="para9-21">9.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He indicated that they were putting together a list of names which they would forward to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">him. That list was emailed by Tom Crone to the MPS.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref621" href="#footnote621">621</a></sup> D/Supt Haydon then drafted a letter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which Mr Crone circulated on his behalf, on 22 October 2010, to 19 members of staff.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref622" href="#footnote622">622</a></sup> In</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that letter D/Supt Haydon explained that he was considering any new material that had come</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to light as a result of the Dispatches programme and said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref623" href="#footnote623">623</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Meanwhile, at the CPS, it appears that Mr Starmer was frustrated that the matter was not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">going to be investigated. Mr Clements recorded in a note of a meeting on 19 October 2010</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that Mr Starmer said:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;No</span><span style="font-style:italic"> one</span><span style="font-style:italic"> wants</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> reopen</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> investigation&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref624" href="#footnote624">624</a></sup> Mr Starmer explained in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref625" href="#footnote625">625</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; I honestly can&#8217;t remember what I said at that meeting but I obviously said</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">something. Mr Clements does remember it and wrote it down at the time and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">thought I was frustrated because it appeared to me that others wouldn&#8217;t reopen the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">investigation.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I&#8217;d had the meeting back in 2009 where a course of action I thought was reasonably</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sensible didn&#8217;t look as if it was going to find favour, and I&#8217;d been told in September</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">2010 that whatever else was going to happen, this was not going to be reinvestigated.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I think if I was expressing any frustration, it was probably borne of these two things.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-23"><a href="#para9-23" name="para9-23">9.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 12 November 2010, D/Supt Haydon submitted to the CPS an &#8220;Advice file&#8221;, dated 10</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">November2010,whichwasaformalrequestforadviceonissuesarisingfromOperationVarec,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including whether there was evidence to justify or support a re-opening or re-investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of Operation Caryatid and the prospects of prosecuting any individuals. He stressed in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">document that his task had not been to re-open or re-investigate the cases of Mr Goodman</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Mr Mulcaire, but noted that there were links and crossovers with the prosecution. He set</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out details of the four phases of the investigation (or scoping exercise).</span>

<p id="para-id-9-24"><a href="#para9-24" name="para9-24">9.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first phase had been to ask the New York Times to provide any material in support of its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">article. The paper had refused the request, claiming journalistic privilege. It was also reported</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">that:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) The police interviewed Sean Hoare under caution in the hope that they could convert</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his claims and admissions into evidence, but he made no comment.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) The police interviewed Sharon Marshall, not under caution, but she did not disclose any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">new evidence.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) The police approached Paul McMullan, a former &#8216;features&#8217; journalist at the NoTW,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on numerous occasions in order to interview him under caution, but he declined to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cooperate.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) The police interviewed Brendan Montague, a freelance journalist, not under caution</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and more as a victim, but he did not disclose any new evidence.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) The police interviewed under caution Ross Hall, who had authored the &#8220;for Neville&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">email and that he had given an account of his employment at the NoTW as a runner in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2005/6 but made no disclosures relating to voicemail interception.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(f) The police interviewed Andy Coulson in the presence of his solicitor, who denied any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involvement with or knowledge of phone hacking.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-25"><a href="#para9-25" name="para9-25">9.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">D/Supt Haydon noted that there were no communications data that would support a criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation or prosecution.</span>


<!--new page--><p id="para-id-9-26"><a href="#para9-26" name="para9-26">9.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">During phase two the police approached Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire but both declined</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to assist the investigation. Neville Thurlbeck was interviewed under caution. Mr Thurlbeck</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">produced a pre-prepared statement and denied knowledge of ever receiving the &#8220;for Neville&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">email. He also denied any involvement in voicemail interception and refused to answer any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further questions. Greg Miskiw was interviewed under caution. He produced a pre-prepared</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statement in which he outlined his dealings with Mr Mulcaire but refused to answer any</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">further questions. Matt Driscoll was interviewed. He was employed at the NoTW as a sports</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reporterbutwasdismissedin2007forsupposedinaccuratereporting.Hesaidininterviewthat</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he knew that voicemail interception was used as a technique but never used the technique</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">himself and that it was not one used on the sports desk where he was employed. The police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also sent letters to three supervisors employed by the NoTW who had been named in an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">anonymous letter. The police did not receive any responses to the letters.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-27"><a href="#para9-27" name="para9-27">9.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">During phase three, the police wrote to the Producer of the Dispatches programme &#8220;Tabloid,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Tories and Telephone hacking&#8221;. In a letter to the MPS dated 22 October 2010, the Controller</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of legal and compliance for Channel 4 wrote:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Havingdiscussedthematterfurtherwiththeproducerswhohavedirectdealingswith</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the 13 individuals, they do not believe that any of the individuals would be prepared</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to assist your investigation. I also confirm that having spoken with the producers</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">they do not have any additional evidence that was not included in the broadcast</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">programme that could assist the MPS and that is not already in the public domain.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-28"><a href="#para9-28" name="para9-28">9.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The MPS also wrote to the editor of the Guardian, the Daily Telegraph, the Independent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the NoTW seeking any new or additional material they held that could assist in the MPS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation. No new material was forthcoming.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-29"><a href="#para9-29" name="para9-29">9.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, phase four involved writing to 19 members of staff still employed by the NoTW</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(paragraph 9.21 above refers) to establish if any could assist or provide any information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relating to voicemail interception. No response was received from any of them.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-30"><a href="#para9-30" name="para9-30">9.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">D/Supt Haydon then set out the following under the heading &#8216;Conclusion&#8217;:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;1. Has the current MPS investigation revealed any further evidence relating to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">unlawful interception of communications, namely mobile telephone voicemails,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">involving The News of the World?</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;It is my view that there remains a vast amount of press and media coverage, claims</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and allegations but with no substantive &#8216;evidence&#8217; in support. There is some possible</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">circumstantial evidence but in the absence of any communications data and any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">other supporting evidence, this cannot be progressed.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I accept that the evidential position does not meet the threshold for a referral to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">CPS but in view of the vast media, public and political scrutiny in this case and due</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to both the MPS and CPS involvement to date, I consider a referral is appropriate in</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">order to agree a joint current and future position in this case &#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-31"><a href="#para9-31" name="para9-31">9.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 10 December 2010 Mr Clements advised on Operation Varec on behalf of the CPS.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref626" href="#footnote626">626</a></sup> He</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concluded that the case did not pass the evidential stage of the test contained in the Code</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for Crown Prosecutors, namely that there must be sufficient evidence to establish that there</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is a realistic prospect of conviction. He added that he considered that the available evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in fact fell &#8220;well below&#8221; the evidential threshold for prosecution. Given the on-going police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation, it would be inappropriate for me to identify precisely what material had formed</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">part of the papers submitted to the CPS or to consider any analysis of the underlying material.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Clements also stated in the advice document that:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I have agreed with Detective Superintendent Haydon that in the future if any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">revelations come to the attention of the Metropolitan police that he considers could</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">properly be said to constitute new and substantial evidence of offending that we will</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">meet together as a panel and conduct a joint assessment of the material and decide</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">whether further assessment or investigation is likely to provide evidence to support</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">criminal proceedings.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-9-32"><a href="#para9-32" name="para9-32">9.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The DPP announced the conclusions reached by Mr Clements in a press statement that day.</span>

<p id="para-id-9-33"><a href="#para9-33" name="para9-33">9.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Based on Operation Varec, Mr Yates has claimed that the issues raised by the New York Times</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">article were properly scoped in collaboration with the CPS.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref627" href="#footnote627">627</a></sup> I do not agree. What Mr Yates</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scoped was a consideration of the material that had been put in the public domain by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">New York Times and the Dispatches programme which itself involved a number of requests</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and interviews; having regard to the circumstances, it is not surprising that these were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unrevealing. What he did not do was go back to the original allegation both in the Guardian</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the New York Times, namely, that there was information in the documents seized from</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Mulcaire which incriminated others at the NoTW. This was the reason for the allegation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that was so potentially damaging to the MPS that it was engaged in a cover up. The answer</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to this allegation was straightforward: without deciding to re-open Operation Caryatid, look</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the material to find out if there is anything in it which bears out what has been alleged.</span>

<h2>10. December 2010: The Guardian article and the aftermath</h2>

<p id="para-id-10-1"><a href="#para10-1" name="para10-1">10.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 15 December 2010, the allegations were provided with a fresh impetus when the Guardian</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">published allegations made by Sienna Miller in her civil claim against NGN and Mr Mulcaire.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The article, entitled<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Phone</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hacking</span><span style="font-style:italic"> approved</span><span style="font-style:italic"> by</span><span style="font-style:italic"> top</span><span style="font-style:italic"> News</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> World</span><span style="font-style:italic"> executive</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8211;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> new</span></span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">scheme commissioned by the [News of the World] and not simply the unauthorised work of its</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">former royal correspondent, Clive Goodman, acting as a &#8216;rogue reporter&#8217; as it [had] previously</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">claimed.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-10-2"><a href="#para10-2" name="para10-2">10.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Particulars of Claim were based upon documents disclosed to her legal advisers by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MPS following a disclosure application to the High Court. The Guardian article alleged that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">one of the documents disclosed implied that Mr Mulcaire had been instructed to intercept</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail messages received by Ms Miller and also by her mother, her publicist, one of her</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">closest friends, as well as Jude Law, her former partner, and his personal assistant. The article</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also reported that:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The document, which has been released to the Guardian by the high court, suggests</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that the hacking of the two actors was part of a wider scheme, hatched early in 2005,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">when Mulcaire agreed to use &#8216;electronic intelligence and eavesdropping&#8221; to supply</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the paper with daily transcripts of the messages of a list of named targets from the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">worlds of politics, royalty and entertainment.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">&#8230;</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The document is gravely embarrassing for Scotland Yard, which has held the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information about the two actors in a large cache of evidence for more than four</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">years and repeatedly failed to investigate it&#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The new evidence implies that the targeting of the royal household, which led to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">original police inquiry, was specifically commissioned by the paper.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In or about January 2005 the News of the World agreed a scheme with Glenn</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire whereby he would, on their behalf, obtain information on individuals relating</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to the following: &#8216;political, royal and showbiz/entertainment&#8217;; and that he would use</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">electronic intelligence and eavesdropping in order to obtain this information. He also</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">agreed to provide daily transcripts.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-10-3"><a href="#para10-3" name="para10-3">10.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The article also alleged that the police had failed to interview four journalists who were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">implicated by the material already in police possession.</span>

<p id="para-id-10-4"><a href="#para10-4" name="para10-4">10.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 6 January 2011, the Guardian asked the CPS a series of detailed questions about whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or not the CPS had been aware, in 2006, of the evidence that was emerging from the civil</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">action brought by Ms Miller. Mr Starmer explained, frankly, that these were not easy questions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to answer given that there was no one to hand within the CPS who had first-hand knowledge</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the investigation and prosecution in 2006. Having said that, however, Mr Starmer was</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">becoming increasingly concerned by the evidence emerging from the civil claim and he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decided that the time had come for a much fuller exercise. At that stage, what he wanted was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an examination of all material available at that time, whether in the possession of the police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or the CPS, and for some further assistance to be given to him about what consideration was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given to it at the time. He explained:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref628" href="#footnote628">628</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;What then happened &#8230; was that as I understood it, some of the information that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was emerging from the Sienna Miller civil action I was told had in fact been amongst</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the unused material. Now, this was the second time this had occurred. The first time</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">was in relation to the Neville email, and now it was happening again in relation to the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Sienna Miller material. And I&#8217;m afraid at that stage I thought nothing less than a root</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and branch review of all the material that we have and the police had is now going</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to satisfy me about this case. And that&#8217;s why I indicated in fact to Tim Godwin, who I</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">think was then Acting Commissioner, that I had for my part reached the view that we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">could no longer approach this on a piecemeal basis looking at bits of material and we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">really had to roll our sleeves up and look at everything.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-10-5"><a href="#para10-5" name="para10-5">10.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In that context, a meeting took place on Friday 14 January 2011 attended by Mr Starmer,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Yates and various other officials and police officers. Mr Starmer opened the meeting by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stating that in view of recent events the time may well have come to reconsider everything</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that is or was available thereby enabling the CPS, if asked, to give comprehensive answers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to current and future questions. The immediate riposte of Mr Yates was to assert that if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">new evidence were available he would examine it but that he did not believe this to be the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">position. The following appeared in notes of the meeting:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref629" href="#footnote629">629</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;DH [a police officer]: Op Varec is the only new material in terms of G/M. There is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">nothing new &#8211; all the stuff is on the system.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;JY: puts both organisations in difficult position: what did we do in 2009?</span>


<a name="page409"></a><!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;DPP: looked at G/M and the decisions made and whether they were correct. This is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a broader examination to go before panel (2006 and subsequent).&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-10-6"><a href="#para10-6" name="para10-6">10.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In answer to the question whether the mood of the meeting was &#8220;all sweetness and light&#8221;,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Starmer stated the following in evidence:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref630" href="#footnote630">630</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I was absolutely clear in my mind at the beginning of that meeting I was going to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">settle for nothing less than a full review of all this material unless somebody blocked</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">me access to it, and I approached it in that way. To be fair to Mr Yates, who did not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">seek to block that approach, and in the end agreed to it, but I have to say but by then</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I had reached the stage where I really was not in the mood for being dissuaded from</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">my then course of action, I am afraid.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-10-7"><a href="#para10-7" name="para10-7">10.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Starmer also said that Mr Yates had a number of concerns about how the review would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">be handled, but did not resist his proposal that there be a root and branch review.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref631" href="#footnote631">631</a></sup> Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Starmer highlighted that Mr Yates was keen that the MPS should request the review rather</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">than having it imposed on them. They therefore agreed that Mr Yates would formally invite</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the DPP to conduct a review. After the meeting Mr Starmer decided that his Principal Legal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Adviser, Ms Alison Levitt QC, should carry it out.</span>

<p id="para-id-10-8"><a href="#para10-8" name="para10-8">10.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The account given by Mr Yates of this meeting had a different emphasis, and suggested that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he was, indeed, concerned about how matters had been dealt with and did not simply adopt</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a refrain that he would act if there were new evidence. He stated as follows in his witness</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">statement:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref632" href="#footnote632">632</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In early January 2011, my level of concern as to how matters had been dealt with to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">date caused me to formally request the DPP to undertake a review of all the material</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in police possession. This he agreed to do and he tasked Alison Levitt, QC to undertake</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this task on his behalf.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-10-9"><a href="#para10-9" name="para10-9">10.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It should be noted that Mr Yates was not questioned about this meeting or asked if he agreed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he said that both organisations had been put in a difficult position, and if so, what he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">meant by it.</span>

<p id="para-id-10-10"><a href="#para10-10" name="para10-10">10.10</a></p>
 That same day Mr Yates wrote to the DPP in the following terms,</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> acknowledging, apparently
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the first time, the possibility that there might be evidence in the existing material which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would warrant further investigation:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref633" href="#footnote633">633</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Wearebothawarethatthereremainoutstandingpublic,legalandpoliticalconcerns.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">This is particularly so in relation to the various and recently reported high profile civil</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">cases &#8230;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;As a result, I consider it would be wise to invite you to further re-examine all the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">material collected in this matter. This would also enable you to advise me and assure</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">yourself as to whether there is any existing material which could now form evidence</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in any future criminal prosecution relating to phone hacking.&#8221;</span>




<!--new page--><p id="para-id-10-11"><a href="#para10-11" name="para10-11">10.11</a></p>
 Also on 14</span> January<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011</span> the CPS and the MPS issueda joint press statement to that effect.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref634" href="#footnote634">634</a></sup>

<p id="para-id-10-12"><a href="#para10-12" name="para10-12">10.12</a></p>
 On 26</span> January<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011, NI provided the MPS with significant new information relating to
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allegations of voicemail interception at the NoTW in 2005 to 2006, which had apparently</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been discovered whilst NI was dealing with requests for disclosure in the civil actions. NI had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">found three key emails implicating an employee other than Mr Goodman. That same day the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MPS announced that it was re-opening its investigation into allegations of unlawful voicemail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interception at the NoTW. Mr Yates claimed that it was this new evidence that brought about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">his decision to reopen the investigation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref635" href="#footnote635">635</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-10-13"><a href="#para10-13" name="para10-13">10.13</a></p>
 Once NI decided to cooperate,</span> the evidential flood gates<span style="font-weight:normal;"> opened, providing material that
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had not been made available to the police by Burton Copeland. I can only repeat that it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impossible to ascertain to what material Burton Copeland had access or what advice they</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">provided.</span>

<p id="para-id-10-14"><a href="#para10-14" name="para10-14">10.14</a></p>
 To complete the chronology,</span> on<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 4</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011, the Guardian reported that the NoTW had
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;hacked&#8221; the mobile phone belonging to Milly Dowler. On 7 July 2011 the final edition of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NoTW was published, with the editorial admitting:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Quite simply, we lost our way &#8230; Phones were hacked, and for that this newspaper is</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 14px;">truly sorry.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-10-15"><a href="#para10-15" name="para10-15">10.15</a></p>
 On 17</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011, for reasons not connected with this investigation but in the light of further
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allegations relating to his conduct,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref636" href="#footnote636">636</a></sup> Sir Paul Stephenson resigned and, on 18 July 2011, Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Yates also resigned.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref637" href="#footnote637">637</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-10-16"><a href="#para10-16" name="para10-16">10.16</a></p>
 On 20</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011</span> the Home Affairs Committee published its<span style="font-weight:normal;"> report:</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> &#8220;Unauthorised</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;"> tapping

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the exercise conducted by Mr Yates:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref638" href="#footnote638">638</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Although what Mr Yates was tasked to do was not a review in the proper police use</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the term, the public was allowed to form the impression that the material seized</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from Mr Mulcaire in 2006 was being re-examined to identify any other potential</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">victims and perpetrators. Instead, the process was more in the nature of a check</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">as to whether a narrowly-defined inquiry had been done properly and whether any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">new information was sufficient to lead to that inquiry being re-opened or a new one</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">instigated. It is clear that the officers consulted about the earlier investigation were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">not asked the right questions, otherwise we assume it would have been obvious that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">there was the potential to identify far more possible perpetrators in the material</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">seized from Mr Mulcaire ...&#8221;</span>

<h2>11. The past unravels</h2>

<h3>The civil proceedings before Vos J and the disclosure process</h3>

<p id="para-id-11-1"><a href="#para11-1" name="para11-1">11.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The civil litigation has attracted extensive public interest and attention. It has also had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wider consequences beyond the confines of the claims for damages themselves. In order to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">understand the full extent of the interception, recording and use of their voicemail messages,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">so that they could properly present their claims, the claimants made disclosure applications</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which required NGN and the MPS<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref639" href="#footnote639">639</a></sup> to disclose various documents.</span>

<p id="para-id-11-2"><a href="#para11-2" name="para11-2">11.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">By way of example, on 6 December 2010 Vos J ordered the MPS to disclose the following</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">classes of documents to Skylet Andrew:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref640" href="#footnote640">640</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) Telephone records used by Mr Muclaire relating to the accessing of Mr Andrew&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail messages.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) Documents evidencing communications between Mr Mulcaire and another person</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerning the interception activities of Mr Mulcaire in relation to Mr Andrew&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail messages.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) Documents evidencing communications between Mr Mulcaire and employees of NGN</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerning information about Mr Andrew.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) Documents concerning payments for information made by NGN to Mr Mulcaire.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) Transcripts of Mr Andrew&#8217;s voicemail messages obtained from Mr Mulcaire.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(f) Documents found during the MPS investigation referring to Mr Andrew or his mobile</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">phone.</span>

<p id="para-id-11-3"><a href="#para11-3" name="para11-3">11.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 17 January 2011, Mr Mulcaire provided information to Mr Andrew indicating that he had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">supplied information from voicemail messages belonging to Mr Andrew to the news desk at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the NoTW, identifying the name of the person whom he alleged had asked him to intercept</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the voicemail messages.</span>

<p id="para-id-11-4"><a href="#para11-4" name="para11-4">11.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As a further example, on 20 July 2011, Hugh Grant and Jemima Khan obtained an order, with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the consent of the MPS, for the disclosure of documents concerning the voicemail messages</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allegedly intercepted by Mr Mulcaire and forming the subject of newspaper articles about</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them in the NoTW and other newspapers.</span>

<p id="para-id-11-5"><a href="#para11-5" name="para11-5">11.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As a result of the claim brought by Lord Prescott, the following statement entered the public</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">domain,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref641" href="#footnote641">641</a></sup> on 19 January 2012:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;On 3 December 2011 [NGN] admitted a list of matters including that it had entered</span>

<h3>The judicial review of the actions of the MPS</h3>

<p id="para-id-11-7"><a href="#para11-7" name="para11-7">11.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The July 2009 Guardian article prompted a number of individuals to question whether their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail messages had been intercepted. Four such individuals were Chris Bryant, MP for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Rhondda, Brendan Montague, Brian Paddick and Lord Prescott. All four contacted the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">MPS asking whether this was the case.</span>

<p id="para-id-11-8"><a href="#para11-8" name="para11-8">11.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Bryant was informed that his name and telephone number appeared in the material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">retrieved during the investigation. Mr Bryant said that the information provided was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;vague</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and incomplete&#8221;<span style="font-style:normal"> .</span><span style="font-style:normal"> By</span><span style="font-style:normal"> letter</span><span style="font-style:normal"> dated</span><span style="font-style:normal"> 25</span><span style="font-style:normal"> February</span><span style="font-style:normal"> 2010,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> he</span><span style="font-style:normal"> requested</span><span style="font-style:normal"> further</span><span style="font-style:normal"> details</span><span style="font-style:normal"> having</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">received information from his service provider to the effect that, in about December 2003,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there had been three unlawful attempts to intercept his communications. He said that he</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was told by the MPS<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;informally</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> telephone</span><span style="font-style:italic"> conversation</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> he</span><span style="font-style:italic"> would</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be</span><span style="font-style:italic"> given</span><span style="font-style:italic"> any</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">further information without a court order.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref643" href="#footnote643">643</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-11-9"><a href="#para11-9" name="para11-9">11.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Paddick was told that there was no information to suggest that he had been subject</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to unlawful monitoring or interception of his telephone. His solicitors enquired again and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the MPS then reported that, in fact, his name and occupation did appear in the documents</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obtained during the investigation.</span>

<p id="para-id-11-10"><a href="#para11-10" name="para11-10">11.10</a></p>
 As regards Lord Prescott,</span> as set out above,<span style="font-weight:normal;"> initially, Mr Yates personally assured him that
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was no evidence to suggest that his voicemail messages had been intercepted; he was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not told about the references to his adviser and her telephone numbers and pass codes. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">first intimation that this was not the case came in December 2009.</span>

<p id="para-id-11-11"><a href="#para11-11" name="para11-11">11.11</a></p>
 So far as Mr Montague was concerned, there was no evidence at the time the proceedings
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were instituted that his name appeared in the documentary material recovered during the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation. His concerns were generalised, rather than being based upon any specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">incident or report. Ultimately, he did not dispute that no evidence had emerged that his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">name or details featured in any of the materials seized from Mr Mulcaire in 2006.</span>

<p id="para-id-11-12"><a href="#para11-12" name="para11-12">11.12</a></p>
 The claim for judicial review was issued on or around 14</span> September<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2010. Lord Prescott was
<span style="font-size: 15px;">added to the proceedings in November 2010. The claimants challenged the decisions of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MPS as to the scope of Operation Caryatid and the decision not to inform every person whose</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail messages had or may have been intercepted that this had or may have occurred.</span>


<!--new page--><p id="para-id-11-13"><a href="#para11-13" name="para11-13">11.13</a></p>
 On 9</span> February<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011, the Directorate of Legal Services at the MPS wrote to Lord Prescott and
<span style="font-size: 15px;">informed him that in<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;recent</span><span style="font-style:italic"> material</span><span style="font-style:italic"> supplied</span><span style="font-style:italic"> &#8230;</span><span style="font-style:italic"> by</span><span style="font-style:italic"> News</span><span style="font-style:italic"> International&#8221;</span> there was an email</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(from an email address associated with Mr Mulcaire) dated 28 April 2006 which appeared to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contain the details of the mobile telephone number and PIN number of the adviser to Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prescott and that there was reference to 45 messages.</span>

<p id="para-id-11-14"><a href="#para11-14" name="para11-14">11.14</a></p>
 On 10</span> March<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011, Mr Bryant was shown facing pages ina notebook seized from Mr Mulcaire
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which contained telephone numbers which would have dialled his phone and very probably</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">left voicemails messages, various addresses where he has lived, the names of his partners, his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">constituency, his home telephone numbers and other personal information.</span>

<p id="para-id-11-15"><a href="#para11-15" name="para11-15">11.15</a></p>
 On 15</span> March<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011,</span> Mr Paddick was shown three documents obtained by the police in<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2006.
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The information included his police mobile phone number, the mobile phone number of his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">then partner and his former partner, the addresses and telephone numbers of numerous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">other associates, his own landline number and landline numbers of others. There was also a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">print out from the electronic records held by Mr Mulcaire which described Mr Paddick as a</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">&#8220;project&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-11-16"><a href="#para11-16" name="para11-16">11.16</a></p>
 On 23</span> May<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011 the application for permission to proceed witha claim by way of judicial

<span style="font-size: 15px;">review came before the Administrative Court.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref644" href="#footnote644">644</a></sup> Mr Justice Foskett considered the facts</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">set out above and decided that in relation to the cases of Mr Bryant, Mr Paddick and Lord</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Prescott, each raised a claim worthy of consideration at a full hearing.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref645" href="#footnote645">645</a></sup> Ultimately the claim</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for judicial review was compromised, with admissions being made by the MPS. The following</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">declaration was agreed between the parties:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;In breach of its duties under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in circumstances where the interference with the individuals&#8217; right to respect for</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">their private lives may have amounted to the commission of a criminal offence, the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">defendant failed to take prompt, reasonable and proportionate steps to ensure that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">those identified as potential victims of voicemail interceptions were made aware of:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The interference with their right to respect for private life that may have occurred;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The possibility of continuing threats, where such threats had been identified;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The steps they might take to protect their privacy; and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Following the conclusion of the criminal proceedings against Glenn Mulcaire and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Clive Goodman, the identity of those whom the police believed to be primarily</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">responsible for the interception.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Such steps should have included informing the public generally, by announcements</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">in the media, through the mobile telephone companies, or otherwise (and should</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">have included, where appropriate, individual notification.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-11-17"><a href="#para11-17" name="para11-17">11.17</a></p>
 The declaration came before the court (Gross</span> LJ and Irwin<span style="font-weight:normal;"> J)</span> for<span style="font-weight:normal;"> approval. Given the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">circumstances (namely a desire by both parties, for their own reasons, to settle the claim,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">together with the absence of argument as to the law), the Court made the agreed declaration</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">but, at the same time, directed that it had no value as a precedent for future cases.</span>

<h2>12. Conclusions: the police and the CPS</h2>

<h3>2006 to 2007</h3>
<h4>The police</h4>

<p id="para-id-12-1"><a href="#para12-1" name="para12-1">12.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am entirely satisfied that the officers who worked on Operation Caryatid approached their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">task with complete integrity and that each of the decisions taken during the investigation and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecution was appropriate, justified and in keeping with the operational imperatives of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police at that time. I have no doubt that neither Peter Clarke nor any of the other officers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were or would have been affected by any relationships between some senior officers and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NI personnel. There is no evidence that the relevant officers approached the task from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">standpoint of seeking to deal with any alleged wrongdoers other than properly and so as to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">bring the force of the law to bear.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-2"><a href="#para12-2" name="para12-2">12.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Furthermore, I find no evidence of compromise to the independence of the police officers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">engaged on Operation Caryatid who were prepared to follow evidence as far as it went but</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were equally mindful of other operational imperatives. Given how little was known about</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail interception when the investigation began in December 2005 and the challenges</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involved in understanding how the interceptions were taking place and then proving the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">interceptions, it could only have been (and was) a robust, tenacious, well-motivated and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">skilful team that achieved such extensive evidence that Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were driven to admit their guilt. Important convictions followed, this criminality was brought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the attention of the public and mobile phone companies were prompted to improve their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">security systems.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-3"><a href="#para12-3" name="para12-3">12.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">There is equally no doubt that the decision made in or around late September 2006 by Peter</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Clarke not to expand the investigation was wholly justified given the threat from terrorism</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the enormous counter terrorism operations then in play (to say nothing of other serious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">crime the investigation of which would be under-staffed because of the demands of such</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigations). In my judgment, there is simply no scope for concluding that the decision was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in any way influenced by pressure from, fear of, or any personal relationships with, employees</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of NI or the NoTW.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-4"><a href="#para12-4" name="para12-4">12.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">That is, however, only the start of the matter. Having decided, albeit for irreproachable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasons, not to investigate journalists other than Clive Goodman, it was imperative that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reasons for the decision were fully and accurately recorded and, furthermore, that the police</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">devise, institute and execute a suitable strategy to deal with the many unresolved issues</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">surrounding the investigation. It is unnecessary to say more about the former (although it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">might have assisted years later when the Operation came to be revisited). As to the latter, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police rightly identified that potential victims of voicemail interception needed to be informed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and it was intended to devise a proportionate and cost-effective strategy. Unfortunately, at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">almost every turn, the strategy devised was not fit for purpose; neither did it succeed.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-5"><a href="#para12-5" name="para12-5">12.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">First, the strategy was insufficiently thought out. Its formulation did not even encompass</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">everyone identified in the blue book. It was intended that those whose voicemail boxes had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been rung by the &#8220;suspect numbers&#8221; would be informed. The strategy therefore overlooked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those identified in the blue book whose voicemail boxes may have been infiltrated by a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalist other than Mr Goodman. It also overlooked those whose voicemail boxes had been</span>
<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">accessed by the suspect numbers but at such an early date that the phone companies no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">longer retained the relevant records.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-6"><a href="#para12-6" name="para12-6">12.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Second, the police did not make the phone companies aware (sufficiently or, probably at all) of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the role that it was intended for them to play; neither did the police obtain their agreement to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">undertakesucharole.Itwassimplyassumedthat,havingbeenaskedtoidentifyanycustomers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whose voicemail boxes had been called by the suspect numbers, the phone companies would</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">naturally inform all those that they identified. Further, despite proceeding on this assumption,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">no steps at all appear to have been taken to check that the phone companies had carried out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the task as anticipated. Although the investigating officers knew that there was an enormous</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">body of material seized from Glenn Mulcaire which pointed towards large scale collection of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information about mobile phones, PINs and other personal details, no sufficient thought was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">given to what impact that material had on the issue of warning victims or potential victims.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-7"><a href="#para12-7" name="para12-7">12.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is entirely understandable that, as more and more has emerged, concern has been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">increasingly expressed that the MPS was protecting the NoTW for it was the reputation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of that paper that benefited from the targeted focus of the investigation and the fact that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">only a small number of potential victims were notified of the facts. In the same way that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I have no doubt that the decision to limit the scope of the investigation was not linked to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">any relationship with NI, I am similarly sure that the failure either to devise or to execute an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">appropriate strategy was not influenced in any way by, or connected to, any inappropriate</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relationship between the MPS and NI.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-8"><a href="#para12-8" name="para12-8">12.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Third, the exit strategy ought also to have given some thought to advising senior management</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the NoTW and NI, about their position and the reasons for the curtailment of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation not least so that management could consider whether (and if so, what) steps</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should be taken to improve corporate governance in this area. In truth, in the light of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">stance taken by the NoTW over a period of years, it is likely that nothing would have been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">done and police concern would have been dismissed. When NI and the NoTW declared that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was just &#8220;one rogue reporter&#8221;, however, consideration should have been given to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extent to which silence on the part of the MPS provided implicit support for the claim. At</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this distance of time and with so much more now known, it is difficult to know what could or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">should have been done. As it was, the issue was not even considered.</span>
<h3>The response of NI to the prosecution and allegations of widespread criminality within the News of the World</h3>

<p id="para-id-12-9"><a href="#para12-9" name="para12-9">12.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NI failed to carry out a proper internal investigation into what had emerged from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecution or into the allegations made by Mr Goodman when appealing against his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">dismissal. Apart from a review of emails sent or received by the individuals named by Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Goodman, the investigation was limited to Mr Cloke and Mr Myler asking the individuals</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">concerned whether there was any substance to the allegations and accepting at face value</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their denials. There was no detailed analysis of precisely what Mr Mulcaire had done to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">justify the enormous sums that he had been paid and no sign that the NoTW was concerned</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with anything other than further damage to its reputation or that it regarded the fact that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal conduct may have flourished as a significant risk either from a corporate governance</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or operational perspective.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-10"><a href="#para12-10" name="para12-10">12.10</a></p>
 Despite the inadequacy of the internal enquiries that were conducted and despite the belief
<span style="font-size: 15px;">held by Mr Crone that it was inaccurate to assert the &#8220;one rogue reporter&#8221; defence, NI</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">maintained publicly that Mr Goodman acted alone. The episode was viewed as an aberration,</span>
<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">involving one journalist and it was maintained that a<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;full,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> rigorous</span><span style="font-style:italic"> internal</span><span style="font-style:italic"> inquiry&#8221;</span> was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being carried out. Rather than face and tackle the problem, the title followed its wish simply</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;draw</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> line&#8221;</span> under it the entire affair and hope that it all went away.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-11"><a href="#para12-11" name="para12-11">12.11</a></p>
 Even when Mr Silverleaf QC advised that there was powerful evidence ofa culture of
<span style="font-size: 15px;">illegal information access used to produce stories for publication, there was no internal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation. Rupert and James Murdoch claimed that there had been a cover up to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which senior management had been victim. If that was right, then the accountability and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">governance systems at NI would have to be considered to have broken down in an extremely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">serious respect. Both Mr Myler and Mr Crone strongly denied that there had been a cover</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">up. Whatever the truth, there was serious failure of governance within the NoTW. Given the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal investigation and what are now the impending prosecutions, it is simply not possible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to go further at this stage. In any event, what can be said is that there was a failure on the part</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the management at the NoTW to drill down into the facts to answer the myriad of questions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that could have been asked and which could be encompassed by the all embracing question</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(whether or not it was in fact asked)<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;what</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> hell</span><span style="font-style:italic"> was</span><span style="font-style:italic"> going</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on?&#8221;</span> This is a significant finding</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the context of the practices of this newspaper at least; whether it can now be said by the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">press generally that it was a case of &#8216;one rogue newspaper&#8217; is another matter.</span>

 NI,</span> through Colin Myler, reacted to the Guardian article by going on the<span style="font-weight:normal;"> attack, labelling the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allegations in a letter to the PCC to be unsubstantiated, irresponsible and wholly false. Before</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC and the CMS Committee, NI maintained the stance that there was no evidence that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any member of staff at the NoTW had been involved in voicemail interception other than Mr</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Goodman. The determination of NI to maintain a line that, at the very least, the legal director</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">believed was not true (and in which, at the very least, the editor, Mr Myler could not be said</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to have had confidence) in the face of two investigations by the CMS Committee and two</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigations by the PCC is extraordinary and, at the very least, a demonstration of loyalty to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the NoTW and its reputation which says a great deal about the culture of the paper (to say</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nothing of its practices and its approach to ethical propriety). In fact, the NoTW maintained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the &#8220;one rogue reporter&#8221; defence until the Spring of 2011 when three NoTW journalists were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">arrested as part of Operation Weeting.</span>
<h4>Police</h4>

<p id="para-id-12-13"><a href="#para12-13" name="para12-13">12.13</a></p>
 Between July 2009</span> and January<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011,</span> the failure to reopen Operation Caryatid<span style="font-weight:normal;"> (or at the very
<span style="font-size: 15px;">least to conduct a proper scoping exercise to decide whether it should be reopened) can be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reduced into five overlapping errors. These are:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) In reality, Mr Yates failed adequately to address any question other than whether</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there was anything in the newspaper reports that constituted &#8220;new evidence&#8221;. This</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was notwithstanding the fact that a vast amount of documentation available from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">August 2006 seizures had not been fully analysed by the MPS itself; very little of it had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been considered (let alone reviewed) by the CPS, save only for the very limited exercise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of disclosure of unused material.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) There was a failure correctly to assimilate the admittedly nuanced advice given by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">counsel in August 2006 as to the likely interpretation of s1 of RIPA, and, probably</span>
<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">because of a misunderstanding, it was later misrepresented.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) There was a mischaracterisation of the evidence which had been provisionally reviewed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in August/September 2006 as amounting to &#8220;no evidence&#8221; either of other criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offences or as implicating other potential defendants or, alternatively, if it was thought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there was evidence but only insufficient to prosecute, to consider whether, in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">light of the Guardian&#8217;s article, that approach continued to be correct.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(d) There was a failure to appreciate that the determinative reason for closing the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation down in September 2006 was not the quality of the evidence but an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operational assessment of competing demands on the resources of SO13 and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">impact of counter terrorism generally and the limited comparative value in further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">pursuing the matter compared to the input that would have been required.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(e) No assessment was made of the impact of the revelations emanating from the Guardian</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the New York Times other than in a defensive frame of mind that the decisions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">taken in 2006 had to be correct (not least because Peter Clarke had made them).</span>

<p id="para-id-12-14"><a href="#para12-14" name="para12-14">12.14</a></p>
I am not in doubt that the reaction of the MPS to the Guardian article published on 8 and
<span style="font-size: 15px;">9 July 2009 was wholly inadequate. For Mr Yates to treat this well-researched piece as &#8216;just</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">another newspaper article&#8217; is wholly at odds with the immediate reaction of others; outside</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the police service, they included the Home Secretary, Parliament, the DPP and, incidentally,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the PCC. Whereas I do not believe that Mr Yates was, in fact, influenced in his decision-making</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by his friendship with Mr Wallis, given the reference to<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;suppressed</span><span style="font-style:italic"> evidence&#8221;</span> , the fact that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the MPS had not alerted all those whose phones were targeted and the fact that a targeted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(albeit comparatively limited) prosecution had been pursued, it was a serious misjudgement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to accept responsibility for making a decision affecting the NoTW (particularly one in favour</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of doing nothing) knowing he was a personal friend of the deputy editor. It did not need to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">him who considered the allegations: it could have been any senior officer.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-15"><a href="#para12-15" name="para12-15">12.15</a></p>
 To make matters worse, Mr Yates dismissed the allegations made by the Guardian ina matter
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of hours. He did not give DCS Williams any real opportunity to refresh his memory as to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">nuances of what had been a comparatively complex investigation which had concluded just</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">short of three years beforehand. Neither did he wait for the documents to be retrieved from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">storage. Further, he did not engage with the substance of the allegations or scrutinise the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information he was given. At the very least, he accepted at face value that there had been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">&#8220;no evidence&#8221; that journalists other than Mr Goodman had been involved in the criminality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and that what leads there might have been were no longer viable. This approach is explained</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">entirely by the inappropriately dismissive, defensive and closed-minded attitude he adopted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from the outset.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-16"><a href="#para12-16" name="para12-16">12.16</a></p>
 Then,</span> having reached his dogmatic conclusion on<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 9</span> July<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2009, he closed his mind to the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">question of whether there might be material in police possession that could justify reopening</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the investigation and clung over-tenaciously to the shibboleth &#8220;no new evidence&#8221;. Operation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Varec in 2010, (following the article in the New York Times) took the same path. The only</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">steps taken were aimed at obtaining &#8220;new evidence&#8221;, including seeking interviews with those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to whom the article referred, requesting material from the New York Times and other titles</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and information from NoTW reporters: there was no question even of scoping the exercise of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">looking at the material that had been in the possession of the police for four years. Even as late</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as January 2011, Mr Yates was warning the DPP of the risk of presentational embarrassment</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to both the MPS and the CPS if matters were re-opened. Unfairly and tendentiously he was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">placing both organisations in the same boat, when plainly they were occupying different</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">vessels. Even to this day, Mr Yates maintains that it was the provision of new information by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NI in January 2011 which warranted the reopening of the investigation and nothing before.</span>
<!--new page--><p id="para-id-12-17"><a href="#para12-17" name="para12-17">12.17</a></p>
 The judgment of DCS Williams was also clouded by his defensiveness. He did not see beyond
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the need to rebut the suggestion of a police cover-up. Rather than conducting a thorough</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">review of his decision-making, DCS Williams simply adopted the position that there was &#8220;no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence&#8221; to implicate any other journalists without making clear that although there had not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been sufficient evidence to charge any other journalists, there was circumstantial evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that had generated further lines of enquiry and therefore that the Guardian was right to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">extent that there was material in police possession that could have been acted upon. There</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was simply no reason for not, at any time, providing the explanation that this additional work</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not undertaken because of an operational decision essentially consequent upon intense</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">counter terrorism duties.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-18"><a href="#para12-18" name="para12-18">12.18</a></p>
 Having said that,I must make it clear thatI accept entirely that DCS Williams was acting
<span style="font-size: 15px;">entirely in good faith; he did not hide evidence or intend to mislead Mr Yates. At its highest,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he mischaracterised what was available and mis-recollected or misunderstood the effect of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the legal advice which had been received. Furthermore, although he secured the documents</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fromstorageandreviewedthepositionoverthefollowingdays,afterthepressannouncement</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which Mr Yates made on the day of the Guardian report, in reality, a defensive mindset had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been engaged and there was no prospect of that decision being revisited.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-19"><a href="#para12-19" name="para12-19">12.19</a></p>
I must also make clear thatI find no evidence to suggest that DCS Williams was influenced in

<span style="font-size: 15px;">any way by the fact that the object of this investigation had been the NoTW. As he had done</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in 2006, if required, he would have been fully prepared to pursue any investigation as far as it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">could be taken. Neither is there any question of his seeking to curry favour with the press or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of him having regard to what might have been considered the overly close social relationships</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of some senior officers with senior members of the press. Having acquitted Mr Yates of being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">affected by the relationship, there is nothing even to base an allegation of that nature against</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Williams: I do not impugn the integrity of DCS Williams in any way.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-20"><a href="#para12-20" name="para12-20">12.20</a></p>
 There is no doubt that the manner in which the MPS remained implacable in the face of
<span style="font-size: 15px;">increasingly strident allegations in the press and demonstrated an unwillingness to revisit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the investigation fuelled a legitimate concern that influence was at work. It is not surprising</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that in the years that have followed there should have developed a belief that relationships</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">between NI and senior figures within the MPS had become so inappropriately close that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">integrity of decision-making by the MPS could not be trusted. Public concern would have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been reinforced by the ill-judged article written by Mr Hayman and published in the Times</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on 11 July 2009. He gave the impression, no doubt inadvertently but undeniably, that he was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being deployed by NI to give support to the police line which, itself, was in support of NI. It</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was also not surprising that the claim for judicial review should follow.</span>
<h4>The CPS</h4>

<p id="para-id-12-21"><a href="#para12-21" name="para12-21">12.21</a></p>
 The conduct of the CPS and counsel in relation to the prosecution of Clive Goodman and
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Glenn Mulcaire cannot be criticised. In the light of the material provided by the police, they</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">advised on an entirely appropriate strategy of targeted prosecution which was pursued</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">effectively to conviction. Analysis of unused material for the purposes of disclosure in that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">case did not involve any assessment of whether others at the NoTW should be investigated or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecuted and there is no suggestion that they were asked to review the Mulcaire material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to advise on whether further investigations should be pursued. That, as I have made clear,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was an operational decision for the police.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-22"><a href="#para12-22" name="para12-22">12.22</a></p>
 Between July 2009</span> and January<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2011, the DPP approached successive revelations in the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">media with an ever open mind and ever-increasing frustration. Quite properly, he took the</span>
<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">Guardian article of July 2009 seriously and commissioned appropriate internal enquiries.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Given the allegation that the CPS had not pursued all possible charges those enquiries</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">naturally focused on the material with which the CPS had been provided and the decisions</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that prosecutors had been required to make. Going further, however, the CPS in general and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the DPP in particular were hampered by the fact that all relevant key personnel had since left</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the CPS. The inevitable diminution of memories by the lapse of time, not surprisingly made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them reliant on briefing notes from the MPS and the review was not assisted by the failure to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">examine witness statements and exhibits from the prosecution. It was, however, correct to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conclude that the original prosecution had been conducted properly.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-23"><a href="#para12-23" name="para12-23">12.23</a></p>
 It was difficult for the DPP to go behind the note prepared by counsel that they were told
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there was no evidence connecting Glenn Mulcaire to other journalists but the press</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">release (<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;I</span><span style="font-style:italic"> am</span><span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic"> position</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> say</span><span style="font-style:italic"> whether</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> police</span><span style="font-style:italic"> had</span><span style="font-style:italic"> any</span><span style="font-style:italic"> information</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span><span style="font-style:italic"> any</span><span style="font-style:italic"> other</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Neville&#8221; email swiftly and, in the circumstances, reviewing the matter on 20/21 July 2009,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it is not surprising that Mr Starmer needed urgent advice from Mr Perry. In that regard, it is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">unfortunate that Mr Perry did not request further time in order to re-acquaint himself with</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the relevant facts and law before advising, and that the resultant product did not accurately</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reflect the advice he had given in August 2006. In reality, however, this made little or no</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">difference to the subsequent course of events.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-24"><a href="#para12-24" name="para12-24">12.24</a></p>
 The further allegations in the New York Times caused the DPP to re-evaluate</span> the legal<span style="font-weight:normal;"> advice:
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he was then put on the right track. Given what the police placed before the CPS in relation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to Operation Varec, the decision as to prosecution was inevitable. In January 2011, following</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the revelations arising from the civil claim brought by Sienna Miller, Mr Starmer reached the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">point where nothing less than a full review would reassure him that all relevant evidence had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been acted on appropriately: that, again, was entirely the correct approach.</span>

<p id="para-id-12-25"><a href="#para12-25" name="para12-25">12.25</a></p>
I conclude by endorsing the position as articulated by Mr Godwin during his evidence:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref646" href="#footnote646">646</a></sup>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230; the police are in a unique position because they&#8217;re an institution that can be called</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">upon to investigate any other part of the establishment machinery, if you like, at any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">time, so in a sense they have to stand slightly apart, and that psychological distance</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">between other institutions and the police.</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean to say you can&#8217;t have completely cordial relations and high quality</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">engagement with other professions or institutions, but at the same time I think the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">police are that organisation who can sometimes be called upon to investigate, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">therefore the need for transparency, the need for accountability, is very high, quite</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">properly, and I wasn&#8217;t entirely convinced some of those risks were identified &#8230;&#8221;</span>
