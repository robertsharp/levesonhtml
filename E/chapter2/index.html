<h1>CHAPTER 2<br/>POLICE INVESTIGATIONS START</h1>

<a name="section1"></a>
<h2>1. Operation Reproof</h2>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In 2001, the Devon and Cornwall Police were investigating an allegation of blackmail in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Plymouth which sprang from the fact that a member of the public had obtained details of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal convictions of someone else. Not surprisingly, the police were concerned to discover</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">how those details had been obtained and, in the course of the investigation, evidence was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">uncovered that an officer serving with the same force had accessed the Police National</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Computer (PNC) record of the victim. It was suspected that he had passed the information to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">individuals working as private investigators, and that the information had ultimately reached</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the hands of the suspect.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In December 2001, therefore, a series of searches of various premises, which supported</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that concern, were carried out. Material was seized which indicated that police officers and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">support staff fromtheforcehad been obtaining details of criminal convictions and information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the keepers of identified vehicles which were stored on police computer systems and</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">then passing that information to private investigators, who would in turn pass it onto their</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">customers. The private investigators were, in the main, retired police officers.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Thus, in January 2002, Operation Reproof was initiated. The Senior Investigating Officer for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that investigation has now retired: his deputy, now Detective Chief Superintendent Middleton</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(then holding the rank of Detective Inspector) gave evidence to the Inquiry.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> The purpose of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the operation, initially, was to scope the material that had been seized during the blackmail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation, with the following terms of reference:</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(a) to investigate the alleged offences and conduct interviews of the individuals identified</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px;">as being in &#8220;jeopardy&#8221;;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(b) to establish links with other agencies to identify individuals who had unlawfully revealed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">confidential information, and to preserve evidence in support of suspected offences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and to interview those individuals; and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(c) to report to the Crown Prosecution Service and the Police Complaints Authority.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Through an analysis of a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> huge</span><span style="font-style:italic"> amount</span><span style="font-style:italic"> of</span><span style="font-style:italic"> evidence&#8221;</span> the police discovered a network of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">companies and individuals throughout the UK, acting as investigators, who were sourcing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information on demand, either directly from a person serving with the police or through a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">third party.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> In particular, the police found that a small number of police officers who had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">retired from the Devon and Cornwall Police had set themselves up as private investigators for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the commercial market and were obtaining information from former colleagues who were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">still working within the police service or other agencies, such as the Department for Work</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and Pensions. The information was then passed through a network of individuals before it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reached the ultimate customer. In most cases that ultimate customer was three or four links</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">up the chain.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref1" name="footnote1" title="Go back to footnote reference 1 in the text">1</a>.  http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Witness-Statement-of-T-ACC-Russell-Middleton.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref2" name="footnote2" title="Go back to footnote reference 2 in the text">2</a>.  p76, line 1, DCI Middleton, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-9-May-2012.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<!--new page--><p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The police sought to identify all the links in the chain and ascertain who in the chain knew</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the information had been obtained unlawfully. The customers were found to be</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requesting either specific pieces of information or packages, which could include a person&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminal background, their financial situation, medical history, telephone records and current</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whereabouts. The customers ranged from individuals involved in matrimonial disputes to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">large financial institutions including insurance companies and debt recovery agents. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police found no evidence that the companies were aware that the information was being</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obtained illegally.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The investigation also showed that serving and retired officers from other police forces were</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involved in similar illegal activities, and had links with the suspects in Devon and Cornwall.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The relevant forces were contacted, including the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police forces of Dorset, Northumbria, Surrey and Essex.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The investigation led the police to a &#8216;data gathering&#8217; company based in Surrey called Data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Research Ltd. Data Research featured heavily as the third link in the chain. As it happened,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the same time, the Information Commissioner was conducting an investigation into the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">same company. On 8 March 2003, the police executed a search warrant at the company&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">offices during the course of which a significant amount of information was found which</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">indicated that data had been obtained unlawfully from the DVLA. This information formed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the basis of Operation Motorman, an investigation then also conducted by the Information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Commissioner (ICO) which has formed an important part of the narrative to the Inquiry. From</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this investigation, the ICO passed material to the MPS, which gave rise to Operation Glade.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">For convenience, having dealt with Operation Reproof, the narrative will pass on to Operation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Glade and then to Operation Motorman.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCS Middleton explained that the CPS and the Police Complaints Authority advised the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police to focus the investigation on (i) individuals who were either systematically providing or</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">receiving information unlawfully from databases, and (ii) the customers who knew or ought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to have known that the information had been obtained unlawfully. The upshot was that two</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">serving police officers, two retired police officers and two individuals associated with Data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Research Ltd were charged with misconduct in public office offences and Data Protection Act</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">offences.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 17 October 2005 a pre-trial hearing took place at Exeter Crown Court before the trial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">judge, His Honour Judge Darlow. The defence argued that the proceedings should be stayed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for an abuse of process. Although not directly relevant to this abuse of process submission,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the defence also contended that accessing the databases and the subsequent passing of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information obtained to insurance companies was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic"> not</span><span style="font-style:italic"> that</span><span style="font-style:italic"> serious</span> &#8221; and that unlawfully</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">accessingthePNCcouldnotamounttothecriminaloffenceofmisconductinpublicoffice.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">prosecution argued that the unlawful disclosure of the information was serious, irrespective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the use to which the data was intended to be put.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-10"><a href="#para1-10" name="para1-10">1.10</a></p>
 On 19</span> October<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2005</span> the judge gave judgment on the issues<span style="font-weight:normal;"> raised. He roundly rejected the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">defence submission that the proceedings should be stayed for an abuse of process. However,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he also expressed the provisional view, not central to his principal conclusion in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the application of which he was formally seized, that the act of a police officer accessing the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">PNC and providing the information to a former colleague might not in the circumstances of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this particular case amount to misconduct in public office, and in any event the matter was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not terribly serious.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref3" name="footnote3" title="Go back to footnote reference 3 in the text">3</a>.  p13, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Witness-Statement-of-T-ACC-Russell-Middleton.pdf</p><!--footnote-->
<!--new page--><p id="para-id-1-11"><a href="#para1-11" name="para1-11">1.11</a></p>
 In any event,</span> following the<span style="font-weight:normal;"> judge&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> comments,a number of case conferences took place with
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the CPS and prosecution counsel. With the judge&#8217;s comments in mind it was decided not to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">proceed on the basis that it would not be in the public interest given the potential costs that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would be incurred. In short, DCS Middleton confirmed in evidence that a fair summary of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">position was that the judge caused the CPS to ask itself,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;do</span><span style="font-style:italic"> we</span><span style="font-style:italic"> want</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to</span><span style="font-style:italic"> spend</span><span style="font-style:italic"> all</span><span style="font-style:italic"> this</span><span style="font-style:italic"> time</span><span style="font-style:italic"> on</span></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">a trial if the judge is of the view either (a) that the facts may not make out an offence, or (b)</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that if they did, it is not a terribly serious matter.&#8221;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> I</span><span style="font-style:normal"> do</span><span style="font-style:normal"> not</span><span style="font-style:normal"> comment</span><span style="font-style:normal"> on</span><span style="font-style:normal"> the</span><span style="font-style:normal"> judge&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style:normal"> expression</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of opinion (also reflected in the sentences which had been passed in relation to Operation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Glade discussed below). I do, however, add that whatever might have been the position</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">considered by the judge and, in consequence, by the CPS in 2005 should not be assumed to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">represent a current assessment of whether conduct of that type constitutes misconduct in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public office or the gravity of such conduct.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-12"><a href="#para1-12" name="para1-12">1.12</a></p>
 In evidence, DCS Middleton was asked why journalists were not within the scope of Operation
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Reproof. He answered:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;I think I need to make clear that they weren&#8217;t out of scope. The whole inquiry right</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">from the outset was extremely open, an open-minded approach as to what we would</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">discover. The initial information, as we said, linked pretty much specifically to a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">local investigation, detective private investigation agency in Devon and the flow of</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">information was from the police officer and the other staff I&#8217;ve mentioned through to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that private investigator, up one or two more chains, and we were tracking customers</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">each and every occasion, open-minded as to who those customers would be, and we</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">never found any direct evidence or indirect evidence linking that information being</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">requested by or for any part of the media or journalists.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-13"><a href="#para1-13" name="para1-13">1.13</a></p>
 In his witness statement,</span> DCS Middleton said<span style="font-weight:normal;"> that:</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There was no direct evidence found during the course of the investigation that any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">media organisation was in any way involved in the obtaining of illicit information</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">being investigated&#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-14"><a href="#para1-14" name="para1-14">1.14</a></p>
 In evidence he was asked whether there was any indirect or inferential evidence thata media
<span style="font-size: 15px;">organisation was involved. DCS Middleton responded:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;As I&#8217;ve said right from the outset, the mindset of myself as the senior investigating</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">officer and my team, who were thoroughly professional throughout, was we were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">open-minded as to what we would find and we would have dealt with that and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 16px;">pursuedthatbasedoninformationorevidencethatwehad.Wedealwithinformation,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">intelligence and evidence. The CPS were working alongside us, as were the Police</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Complaints Authority. We did not have anything that directly or indirectly linked to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">journalists. Had we done so, we&#8217;d have thoroughly investigated that.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the press and the MPS generally or with certain senior officers in particular. Although self</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Motorman<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> was commenced because an audit by Devon and Cornwall Police had</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">identified that Paul Marshall, a civilian member of the police staff at Tooting police station,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">had been accessing the PNC and obtaining information for Steve Whittamore, a private</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigator. A search warrant (executed with the Information Commissioner&#8217;s investigators</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">present) at the latter&#8217;s premises demonstrated that he was involved in obtaining details of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an individual&#8217;s criminal history by way of a check through the Criminal Records Office (CRO)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or details of his or her address by way of a check on the registered keeper of a vehicle. A</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">large number of such checks were on behalf of the national press, where the information</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subsequently appeared. As we have seen above, Devon and Cornwall Police had also searched</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the premises of the data gathering company, Data Research Ltd; this was the corporate<span style="font-style:italic"> alter</span></span>

<p id="para-id-2-3"><a href="#para2-3" name="para2-3">2.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The evidence relating to Data Research Ltd was referred to the MPS, which first carried out a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scoping exercise in order to decide whether the matter should formally be investigated. The</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation (Operation Glade), began in August 2003 with Detective Chief Inspector Mick</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Allen appointed as the Senior Investigating Officer and DCI Brendan Gilmour (then Detective</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inspector Gilmour) as the Investigating Officer.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">he and his colleagues were alive to the sensitivity of investigating journalists but said that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">he could not recall specific discussions about the issue. He expressly disavowed that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigators were in fear of the press:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;Well, considering the work that we were doing, investigating corrupt police</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">employees, police officers and members of civilian staff, investigating journalists</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">didn&#8217;t present any fear. There wasn&#8217;t any fear involved at all. But we did recognise</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the significance of what we were doing and the attention that that would attract and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that would obviously shape how we approached that, but it certainly wouldn&#8217;t have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">stopped us doing it and there was no trepidation around it.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-5"><a href="#para2-5" name="para2-5">2.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He also denied fearing a backlash from the press.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DCI Gilmour was asked whether the resource implications of taking on journalists and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">powerful newspapers, who would have access to sophisticated legal advice, were a factor in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">their decision-making. His response was that such considerations would not have stopped</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the investigating team from doing what it needed to do.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">The terms of reference of Operation Glade were ultimately set down as follows:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;To investigate (covertly) at this time the allegations against Marshall in order to</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Stephen Whittamore. There appears to be clear evidence that Marshall is conducting</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">illegal PNC or CRO checks on behalf of John Boyall at the request of a number of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reporters. The aim of the investigation will be to gather evidence of Marshall, Boyall</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and Whittamore&#8217;s involvement in the misuse of the PNC or CRO systems with a view</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to prosecuting them for any offences disclosed or to prevent further misuse. Early</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consultation will take place with the CPS regarding appropriate charges should</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">sufficient evidence be obtained.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-8"><a href="#para2-8" name="para2-8">2.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is noteworthy that the terms of reference did not expressly encompass investigating the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists who had received the information. In the event, however, it became clear that DCI</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Gilmour did not consider that this limited the extent of the investigation or prevented the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigators from turning their attention to those journalists at the appropriate time.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-9"><a href="#para2-9" name="para2-9">2.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Through analysis of telephone data relating to Mr Marshall, the Operation Glade investigators</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">established that a retired police sergeant, Alan King, had been acting as the conduit between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Marshall on the one hand and Mr Boyall and Mr Whittamore on the other. There was no</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence that any other police personnel were involved. On 10 November 2003, Mr King was</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">arrested.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
 Meanwhile,</span> from the very detailed ledgers of Mr<span style="font-weight:normal;"> Whittamore&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> business, the investigators

<span style="font-size: 15px;">found invoices to journalists setting out what information was sought and his fee for obtaining</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that information. Contrary to the approach adopted in relation to Mr King, on or around 16</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">January 2004 DCI Gilmour decided to interview the journalists identified in the ledgers under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">caution (and therefore as suspects) but also decided, as an operational matter, not to arrest</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them, but to invite them to attend voluntarily for interview.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
 The difference in approach was explained on the basis that DCI Gilmour was confident that
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the attendance of the journalists could be secured voluntarily, whereas the same was not so</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to Mr King. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The default isn&#8217;t always to arrest in the first instance. My consideration then were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">what is it that I was hoping to achieve and what I wanted to achieve was to interview</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the journalists under caution. I, through the legal departments of the various</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">newspapers, was able to access and secure the attendance of the journalists, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that was relatively straightforward, I think, without any complication. Whereas King,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">I didn&#8217;t have that access to King and it was necessary&#8230;to secure his attendance at</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the police station for investigation interview by arresting him&#8230;for every suspect, it&#8217;s a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">consideration as to whether or not they need to be arrested in order to achieve what</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">it is you want to achieve.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-12"><a href="#para2-12" name="para2-12">2.12</a></p>
 He also explained it was not necessary to arrest the journalists because, given the evidence
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the ledgers that the journalists had requested the information, there was no need to carry</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">out searches of the journalists&#8217; premises (arrest carries with it certain powers of search under</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup> It is not without interest that this approach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not adopted in relation to Clive Goodman during the course of Operation Caryatid and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">neither is it necessarily accurate: in any case which is dependent on circumstantial evidence,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">whatever documentary evidence can be found is always likely to add weight (or detract) from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the strength of the case. Having said that, however, the legitimacy of different approaches</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by different officers must be accepted and there is no evidence or basis for suggesting an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">ulterior motive.</span>

<!--new page--><p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
 Between 19</span> January<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2004</span> and<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 31</span> January<span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2004, the police interviewed seven journalists
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under caution. As anticipated each attended voluntarily and was legally represented. All</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the journalists admitted that they had used Mr Whittamore to obtain information but each</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">denied knowing that the information was being obtained unlawfully. DCI Gilmour said that</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a number of the journalists gave the account that they believed that the information was</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">coming from the courts and that &#8220;CRO&#8221; stood for &#8220;Court Record Office&#8221;. DCI Gilmour made</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">it clear that it was put to them in interview that they must have known that Mr Whittamore</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not obtaining the information from a court office because of the speed of turnaround of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the requests, sometimes a matter of hours. However, each adhered to the line and claimed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that he would not have used Mr Whittamore or any agency had it been known that the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information was being obtained unlawfully. DCI Gilmour said that it was specifically put to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">them that, by their very nature, details of convictions must have been obtained unlawfully.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The journalists simply pleaded ignorance.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-14"><a href="#para2-14" name="para2-14">2.14</a></p>
 The police sought the advice of the CPS as to the likelihood of successfully prosecuting all the
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suspects, including the journalists, and as to the appropriate charges.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
 The CPS advised that Messrs Marshall,</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> King, Boyall and Whittamore should be charged with
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office. As regards the journalists, the CPS advised</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone because it was unlikely to be proved</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that there was the requisite degree of knowledge that the information was being unlawfully</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">obtained. DCI Gilmour explained his disappointment at the view of the CPS that they could</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not prove the necessary guilty knowledge.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup> The Inquiry has not investigated the reasons for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">this conclusion (which some may argue appears overcautious): the relationship between the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">CPS and the press has not been the subject of investigation. What can be said with certainty,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">however, is that this material does not provide any evidence that the failure to prosecute</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">any of the journalists was influenced or motivated by any fear of the press on the part of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police, or by any improperly close relationship.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-16"><a href="#para2-16" name="para2-16">2.16</a></p>
 Messrs Marshall and King pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charges.A count of obtaining
<span style="font-size: 15px;">personal information contrary to s55(1)(a) of the Data Protection Act 1998 was later added</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the indictment against Messrs Boyall and Whittamore. They pleaded guilty to that offence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and the conspiracy charge was left to lie on the file.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-17"><a href="#para2-17" name="para2-17">2.17</a></p>
 In April 2005</span> all four defendants were given conditional discharges and further<span style="font-weight:normal;"> details,
<span style="font-size: 15px;">including the judge&#8217;s sentencing remarks, are in Chapter 3 below. DCI Gilmour made it clear</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that these sentences were a disappointment for the police. In May 2005, the CPS sought</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">counsel&#8217;s advice as to the merits of a reference under s36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1998</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Court of Appeal to challenge the sentences on the ground that they were unduly</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lenient. DCI Gilmour explained that for a number of legal reasons, on which he was not able</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to elaborate, counsel advised against this course of action. The comment made in paragraph</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">1.11 above about current perceptions of the gravity of this type of conduct is repeated.</span>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref15" name="footnote15" title="Go back to footnote reference 15 in the text">15</a>.  p69, lines 1-2, DCI Gilmour, <em>ibid</em></p><!--footnote-->
<p class="footnote"><a href="#footnoteref16" name="footnote16" title="Go back to footnote reference 16 in the text">16</a>.  For my part, it seems remarkable that notwithstanding all that has been written about criminal records over<span style="font-size: 12px;"> theyears, the journalists all misunderstood the meaning of the acronym &#8220;CRO&#8221; or believed that a search of court recordscould have been accomplished within the time of the response. That said, I am not suggesting that the advice of theCPS, on which the police were bound to act, was based on anything other than an objective and independent mindedassessment of the strength of the evidence. The Inquiry has gone no further than this summary identifies; its value issimply as part of the history of attempts to use the criminal law in this area.</span></p><!--footnote-->
