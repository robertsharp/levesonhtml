<h2>1.  Police Inquiries: Operations Weeting, Elveden and  tuleta</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p id="para-id-1-1"><a href="#para1-1" name="para1-1">1.1</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Weeting commenced on 26 January 2011. Its immediate spur was the provision</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) by News International (NI) of what the MPS has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">characterised as significant new information relating to allegations of phone hacking at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the News of the World (NoTW) in 2005-2006.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> Its remit was initially to investigate these</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">allegations, but evidence relating to other dates and print titles is now being considered. The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operation falls under the aegis of the Specialist Crime Directorate (SCD) of the MPS, and at all</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">material times until 31 October 2012 has been headed by DAC Sue Akers, head of organised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">crime and criminal networks with the SCD, who has received universal praise for her work.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">DAC Akers also headed Operations Elveden and Tuleta.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-2"><a href="#para1-2" name="para1-2">1.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Elveden began on 20 June 2011 following the MPS being handed by NI a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">documents containing evidence relating to alleged inappropriate payments to a small number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of police officers by journalists at the NoTW in exchange for confidential information.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> Since</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">its early stages however, the ambit of Operation Elveden has widened significantly: additional</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">print titles are now being investigated, as well as a range of public officials.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-3"><a href="#para1-3" name="para1-3">1.3</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Tuleta commenced as a scoping exercise in June 2011 to consider the possibility</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of investigating allegations of computer hacking at the NoTW falling outside the remit of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operations Elveden and Tuleta.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> In due course it became a fully-fledged investigation, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">again its scope has broadened considerably.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-4"><a href="#para1-4" name="para1-4">1.4</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DAC Akers attended the Inquiry on 6 and 27 February, and 23 July 2012, to provide updates</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">as to the current status of these three operations. On each occasion she helpfully provided</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a witness statement which she elaborated in oral evidence.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> On 31 October 2012 DAC Akers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">filed a fourth witness statement which brings the position as up to date as it can be.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> She</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was not asked to give oral evidence in line with that statement. This section of the Report is</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">heavily based on her evidence, as well as other material which is in the public domain.</span>

<!--new page--><h4>Operation Weeting</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-5"><a href="#para1-5" name="para1-5">1.5</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As at 6 February 2012 there were 90 officers including support staff dedicated to Operation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Weeting; of these, approximately 35 worked full time in relation to notifying and supporting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the victims.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> As DAC Akers has explained in evidence, in its initial phases Operation Weeting</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">focused on seeking to notify the victims and on analysing the numerous pages of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mulcaire notebooks,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> which had been seized as part of Operation Caryatid on 8 August 2006.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">9</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Subsequently, however, Operation Weeting acquired possession of substantial quantities of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">email data from a variety of sources.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> In due course, the MPS was provided with the content</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of NI&#8217;s main server from 2005, containing a vast number of permanently deleted emails.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Officers working on Operation Weeting have been able to complete the reconstruction of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">these deleted emails recovered from storage devices obtained from NI, restoring three</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hundred million emails. DAC Akers has informed the Inquiry that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;we&#8217;ve rebuilt &#8211; experts have rebuilt material that we thought had been lost, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">that was completed towards the end of November last year. So we&#8217;re now going</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">through that material.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-1-6"><a href="#para1-6" name="para1-6">1.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The first arrest carried out under Operation Weeting was in April 2011, and the last (to date)</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the end of August 2012. So far, 25 people<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">13</a></sup> have been arrested in connection with phone</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">hacking, ten of whom are non-journalists. 17 individuals have been arrested for conspiring</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to intercept communications and/or in relation to the substantive offence. Of these, seven</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">former NoTW employees have been charged with an overarching, general offence of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">conspiracy to intercept communications, and an additional former employee has also been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">charged with a number of date-specific substantive offences. A provisional court date has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been fixed for 9 September 2013. Of the 17 arrested, six individuals have been released from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police bail with no further action taken; the remaining three individuals remain on police bail</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for conspiracy offences.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-7"><a href="#para1-7" name="para1-7">1.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">It is clear that Operation Weeting has expended a considerable amount of police manpower</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and resource. It is also clear that its work has not finished.</span>

<p id="para-id-1-8"><a href="#para1-8" name="para1-8">1.8</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Eight individuals have been arrested for perverting the course of justice: this operation has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been named Operation Sacha. Seven of these have been charged with conspiring to commit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that offence, and have been sent to the Crown Court for trial. A hearing for the defendants&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">applications to dismiss is scheduled for 12 and 13 December 2012.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></span>

<!--new page--><h3>Operation Elveden</h3>

<p id="para-id-1-9"><a href="#para1-9" name="para1-9">1.9</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In February 2012 there were 40 police officers and staff working on Operation Elveden and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MPS was in the process of increasing this to 61.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">16</a></sup> The investigation has entailed going through</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">large quantities of NI business records and emails, seeking evidence relevant to suspicious</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">payments. As of 26 October 2012 a total of 52 individuals had been arrested by officers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">working on Operation Elveden; of these, 25 are current and former journalists (including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">journalists from The Sun; the Daily Mirror and its sister paper, the Sunday Mirror<span style="font-style:italic"> ;</span> and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Daily Star Sunday).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref17" href="#footnote17">17</a></sup> The arrests made thus far under Operation Elveden are for offences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">under the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906, misconduct in a public office and conspiracy to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commit these offences, aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office, money laundering</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">contrary to s328 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and bribery contrary to s1 of the Bribery</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Act 2010;<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref18" href="#footnote18">18</a></sup> the gravamen of the allegations being that they offered money to public officials</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in exchange for stories. As at 26 October 2012 files had been submitted to the CPS to advise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on appropriate charges for three public officials and four current and former journalists.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">19</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-10"><a href="#para1-10" name="para1-10">1.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In an important piece of evidence, DAC Akers pointed out that offences<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">20</a></sup> of this nature are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">suspected to have been committed in at least three separate newspaper titles right up to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">early 2012.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref21" href="#footnote21">21</a></sup> DAC Akers expects further arrests to be made in due course.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref22" href="#footnote22">22</a></sup></span>

<h4>Operation Tuleta</h4>

<p id="para-id-1-11"><a href="#para1-11" name="para1-11">1.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Tuleta began with an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the hacking</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">into computers of Ian Hurst by or at the instigation of NoTW journalists in 2006.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref23" href="#footnote23">23</a></sup> As at October</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2012, Operation Tuleta was undertaking an assessment of 142 separate allegations of data</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">intrusion, including allegations of phone hacking, computer hacking, and improper access to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">banking, medical and other personal records.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref24" href="#footnote24">24</a></sup> This has entailed interrogating between 8-12</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terabytes of data across 70 different storage devices; a vast undertaking.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref25" href="#footnote25">25</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-1-12"><a href="#para1-12" name="para1-12">1.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In April 2012, officers working on Operation Tuleta discovered inconsistencies with regard to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the origin of material they had received from the Management Standards Committee (MSC).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref26" href="#footnote26">26</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Some of the information provided by the MSC had been traced to material which appears to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have been obtained from two stolen mobile phone devices. DAC Akers has said that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref27" href="#footnote27">27</a></sup></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">ensured their silence but a number of the victims were prepared to invest in legal proceedings</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">both to learn precisely what had happened and to obtain redress. Very substantial further</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">payments in settlement did not stem the tide and, although most of the press was entirely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">silent on the subject, the effect of the July 2009 story in the Guardian (quite apart from the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach of the police) was to generate enquiry in Parliament, press coverage in the New</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">York Times and the fact (and yet further risk) of an exponential rise in litigation.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-2"><a href="#para2-2" name="para2-2">2.2</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the circumstances that have been described, the MPS grasped the nettle and re-opened</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the investigation; from the perspective of NI, containment was no longer an option because</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the reputational risk to News Corporation (News Corp) (let alone NI) required a complete</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">change of direction. That came in the form of the Management and Standards Committee</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(MSC) and in July 2011, the board of News Corp appointed the distinguished UK commercial</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lawyer, Lord Grabiner QC, to the role of Chairman.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">TheindependenceoftheMSCfrombothNIandNewsCorpisoneofitsdefiningcharacteristics.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This independence is ensured by requiring the MSC to operate its own governance structure,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">separate to that of News Corp. The MSC is housed and operates from a secure unit on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NI&#8217;s Wapping site in London, located at a physical distance from the main NI building.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref36" href="#footnote36">36</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This independence, both in physical and figurative forms, is critical to the MSC&#8217;s ability</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independently to investigate the allegations of wrongdoing at the NoTW, as well as at NI.</span>

<h4>Terms of reference and remit</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-6"><a href="#para2-6" name="para2-6">2.6</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The MSC was established by News Corp with a role and remit to investigate allegations of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">criminality relating to phone hacking at the NoTW and other NI titles. Specifically, the MSC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been set up to investigate a number of matters including: allegations of phone hacking at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the NoTW; allegations of illegal payments made by NI employees to public officials, including</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">police officers; and all other related issues with regard to NI (including this Inquiry).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref37" href="#footnote37">37</a></sup> The</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Committee has therefore played a role of fundamental importance to the ongoing criminal</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and other investigations into the allegations of wrongdoing at NI. The reason for this new</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">approach is clear. Quite apart from issues concerned with reputation, the United States&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it illegal for any US company to pay bribes to overseas</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">officials and News Corp (the corporate parent of News International) is incorporated in the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">USA. In the light of what had emerged in the UK, it is not surprising that while NI (and, to a</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">lesser extent, News Corp) is subject to investigation in the UK, government and regulators</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in the USA have also been concerned to look at what had been happening. Rupert Murdoch</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">told the Inquiry that News Corp (through the MSC) was therefore cooperating fully with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">US Department of Justice.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref38" href="#footnote38">38</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-7"><a href="#para2-7" name="para2-7">2.7</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The UK investigations into allegations of phone hacking and payments to public officials are</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">being led by the MPS. Operation Elveden, investigating the allegations of police corruption,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been operating under the supervision of the Independent Police Complaints Commission</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">(IPCC).<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref39" href="#footnote39">39</a></sup> The MPS investigations have focused on the UK subsidiary, NI, and although the MSC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is cooperating with enforcement agencies in both the USA and the UK, the investigatory remit</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the MSC is restricted to only NI titles and matters in the UK.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref40" href="#footnote40">40</a></sup> The MSC has been authorised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the News Corp board to investigate practices through a process of internal review at the</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">According to representatives of the MSC, the purpose of this role is to ensure that the highest</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">in phone hacking at the NoTW.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref42" href="#footnote42">42</a></sup> The Scheme was launched on 4 November 2011, with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">solicitors, Olswang, being appointed to handle all victim-driven civil litigation in relation to</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Scheme.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref43" href="#footnote43">43</a></sup> Sir Charles Gray (formerly a High Court Judge and a very experienced media lawyer)</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was appointed as the adjudicator of the Scheme. As such, he has provided an independent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">assessment of any applications received for compensation claims made against NGN by those</span>

<p id="para-id-2-10"><a href="#para2-10" name="para2-10">2.10</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">According to NI, the purpose of the Scheme is to offer an accessible and streamlined process</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the victims of voicemail hacking, in order that they might obtain remedial action without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the complexities that can be involved in the court process. The Scheme has also promised</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">an uplift of 10% in respect of potential payments, based on what victims might expect if</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">they successfully settled in the courts. The Scheme has advised potential victims of alleged</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">voicemail hacking to contact the police team in Operation Weeting before applying to join the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Scheme, so that the police can identify whether they have been revealed to have been a victim</span>

<p id="para-id-2-11"><a href="#para2-11" name="para2-11">2.11</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The autonomy of the MSC has been the cornerstone of the collaboration between the MSC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and all those working on the ongoing investigations into the allegations of wrongdoing at</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NI.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref46" href="#footnote46">46</a></sup> In addition to the three overarching investigations being undertaken by the MPS, namely</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operations Weeting, Elveden (under the supervision of the IPCC) and Tuleta, along with the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">subsidiary operations that are derived from those, there are the ongoing civil proceedings</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relating to phone hacking and data hacking and the Parliamentary hearings of the Culture,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Media and Sport Select Committee.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref47" href="#footnote47">47</a></sup> In this regard, in its 11<span style="font-size: 9px;"> th</span> Report of Session 2010-12,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that Committee commented on the cooperation of the MSC at the time of the Parliamentary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation, praising:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref48" href="#footnote48">48</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;the willingness of the newly-established Management and Standards Committee</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to provide the Committee with unsolicited copies of recently unearthed e-mail</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">exchanges that are of relevance to the events under investigation&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-12"><a href="#para2-12" name="para2-12">2.12</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers has sought to explain to the Inquiry the nature</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and reality of the relationship between the MPS and the MSC. In particular, DAC Akers has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">praised the levels of assistance and cooperation demonstrated by the MSC, as well as its</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cooperation in providing information which has been requested by officers conducting the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">three MPS investigations. As an example of the cooperative approach of the MSC toward</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">the MPS investigations, this has included the voluntary disclosure of potential evidence to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Elveden, gathered as part of the MSC&#8217;s internal review of The Sun.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref49" href="#footnote49">49</a></sup> It is also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">perhaps illustrative of the MSC&#8217;s approach to the matters of investigation, that the Committee</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">initiated internal reviews of The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times without specific</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">requests from the MPS.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-13"><a href="#para2-13" name="para2-13">2.13</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">To a certain extent, the MPS has been dependent on the cooperation of the MSC in relation to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the disclosure of information; although cooperation is exactly what the police would expect</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">from any corporate body where evidence of criminality has been revealed. As DAC Akers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">explained to the Inquiry, however, because of the terms of the Police and Criminal Evidence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Act 1984 (PACE) (as to which the Deputy Commissioner of the MPS has made submissions to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the Inquiry), the MPS has not been in a position to force compliance. She stated that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref50" href="#footnote50">50</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;the legal advice that we&#8217;ve had has told us that whilst you have the co-operation</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of News International, as it is in this case, we must proceed by the way of protocol,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing. So it&#8217;s voluntary disclosure as opposed to applying for a</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">production order through PACE&#8221;.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">since November 2011 have been highly publicised. Indeed, some of this coverage has led to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">complaints from current journalists at The Sun, particularly concerning the circumstances</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and scale of the arrests. By way of example, following the arrests on 11 February 2012, the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">associate editor of The Sun, Trevor Kavanagh, claimed that a disproportionately large number</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of police officers had been involved in the dawn arrests of journalists at their homes and in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Sun offices, representing a witch hunt and an attack on press freedom.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref52" href="#footnote52">52</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-15"><a href="#para2-15" name="para2-15">2.15</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In response, Ms Akers explained that the fact that the arrests were carried out without</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">warning was in line with protocols for such investigations, with the primary goal being to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">secure evidence and prevent suspects from conferring or disposing of evidential material.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref53" href="#footnote53">53</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">She also suggested that arrests had been carried out in a manner intended to minimise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">business disruption to the newspaper, noting that searches of The Sun offices were conducted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">on a Saturday, outside of business hours. She went on to state that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref54" href="#footnote54">54</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The purpose of police action to date has been proactively to investigate the alleged</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">criminality which has been identified. The aim has never been to threaten the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">existence of The Sun. To this end there has been liaison with the MSC to take account</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of business risk to The Sun newspaper hence searches being made at The Sun offices</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on a Saturday when the office would be empty&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DAC Akers has acknowledged that this approach to the conduct of searches has since been</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">changed, following the launch of The Sun on Sunday.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-16"><a href="#para2-16" name="para2-16">2.16</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DAC Akers has also told the Inquiry that there was a time when the attitude of the MSC to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the MPS changed somewhat. Following the arrests of 28 January 2012 and 11 February 2012,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DAC Akers said that the approach of the MSC to the disclosure of evidence was different:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref55" href="#footnote55">55</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;We were being asked perhaps to justify our requests to a degree that we perhaps</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">formerly hadn&#8217;t been, and the material that we were requesting was slower in being</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">forthcoming&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-17"><a href="#para2-17" name="para2-17">2.17</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This change of behaviour occurred at a time of increased publicity for both the MPS and the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MSC, against a backdrop of threats of legal action against the MSC and also when changes</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">were made to the senior personnel at the MSC,<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref56" href="#footnote56">56</a></sup> which might themselves have contributed</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to the different relationship between the MSC and the MPS. In this regard, she observed:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref57" href="#footnote57">57</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;those two arrest days, there was considerable adverse publicity of both the MPS,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the police and the MSC, including threats of legal action against the MSC.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">More specifically, DAC Akers has referred to a period in May 2012 when, for a number of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">weeks, the MSC temporarily halted the voluntary disclosure of material to the MPS.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref58" href="#footnote58">58</a></sup> She</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">reported to the Inquiry her understanding that the MSC had been considering their position</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in relation to the MPS operations during this hiatus<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref59" href="#footnote59">59</a></sup> and went on:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref60" href="#footnote60">60</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;At the beginning, when we began the enquiries, all contact was through the lawyers;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">then these were other lawyers, Burton Copeland. Then Mr Lewis and Mr Greenberg</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">were introduced to help facilitate the co-operation, which they did. And in mid-</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">May this year, following a development in our investigation, it caused the MSC to</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">reconsider their position and they decided that they would prefer the meetings to be</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">on a more formal basis with lawyers only&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-19"><a href="#para2-19" name="para2-19">2.19</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DAC Akers stressed the importance of full cooperation by the MSC to police operations, and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">commented that any change in the approach of the voluntary disclosure of evidence would:</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8230;</span> adversely affect initial decisions that we&#8217;d made and arrests that were made as well<span style="font-style:normal"> &#8221;.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref61" href="#footnote61">61</a></sup><span style="font-style:normal"> The</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disclosure of documentation by the MSC resumed in mid-June, following discussion between</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the MPS with Lord Grabiner and the legal team representing the MSC.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref62" href="#footnote62">62</a></sup> Such consequences</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">would undeniably have affected the extent to which NI could have argued that it had adopted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">a new approach to compliance with the criminal law.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-20"><a href="#para2-20" name="para2-20">2.20</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">At that same meeting, a new framework was agreed in relation to communication. This has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">involved a changed format to meetings between the MSC and MPS teams, and, notably,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the insistence on legal representation by the MSC while liaising with officers from the MPS</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operations.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref63" href="#footnote63">63</a></sup> Further, a number of executive members of the MSC, including Will Lewis and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Simon Greenberg, have been stood down from attending regular briefings between the two</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">parties.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref64" href="#footnote64">64</a></sup> Despite the change in process, DAC Akers was keen to make clear in evidence to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Inquiry that the professional approach of the MSC towards the MPS has been maintained and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that the change<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;&#8230;hasn&#8217;t</span><span style="font-style:italic"> affected</span><span style="font-style:italic"> the</span><span style="font-style:italic"> co-operation,</span><span style="font-style:italic"> which</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is</span><span style="font-style:italic"> still</span><span style="font-style:italic"> very</span><span style="font-style:italic"> good&#8221;</span> .<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref65" href="#footnote65">65</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-21"><a href="#para2-21" name="para2-21">2.21</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Since DAC Akers gave evidence in July, it is clear that some tensions have become apparent</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">about the way in which the relationship between the MSC and the MPS has developed. I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cannot resolve this issue and, for good reason, I am satisfied that it is not appropriate to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">elaborate or even to set out the respective positions. In the circumstances, I leave the matter</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">there.</span>

<!--new page--><h4>The approach of the MSC to disclosure</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-22"><a href="#para2-22" name="para2-22">2.22</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Material provided by the MSC is for the MPS to assess, evaluate and follow up as appropriate.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The MSC has made clear that it has a duty to protect journalistic sources used by the NI</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">titles and it is careful to ensure that these are not compromised through disclosure.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref66" href="#footnote66">66</a></sup> Where</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">disclosed material might enable the identification of confidential but legitimate sources of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">information, the MSC has provided such documentation in redacted form. All such material</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has been categorised in order to determine whether and what redactions should apply.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-23"><a href="#para2-23" name="para2-23">2.23</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">To this end, DAC Akers has explained the detail of the process of receiving documents</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relating to the allegations of alleged payments to public officials. In such circumstances,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">documents which, in the first instance, have been redacted to remove confidential material,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">are provided to officers working on Operation Elveden. However, if, following this disclosure,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the assessment of the evidence by the MPS provides a proper justification for identifying the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">source, the MSC will provide the information, this time in an unredacted form.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref67" href="#footnote67">67</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-24"><a href="#para2-24" name="para2-24">2.24</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In response to questions from Mr Jay, DAC Akers has sought to provide a sense of the scale and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">scope of the material disclosed by the MSC. She noted that this material related to allegations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of data intrusion, including phone hacking, computer hacking and the illegal accessing of</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">other personal data. Separately, it also contains material relevant to Operation Tuleta, which</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">is now investigating over 100 separate allegations of data intrusion. The documentation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">provided has been sourced from previous inquiries, as well as the review of 70 electronic</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">storage devices which were seized during both Operations Weeting and Elveden.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref68" href="#footnote68">68</a></sup> Ms Akers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">has said that the evidence gathered amounted to between eight and twelve terabytes of</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">data.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref69" href="#footnote69">69</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-25"><a href="#para2-25" name="para2-25">2.25</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Material of real significance has also been disclosed by the MSC to officers working on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Operation Elveden, which appears to indicate that not only were routine payments made to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">public officials by some journalists working at the NoTW but that similar payments had also</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been made by the employees of The Sun. These payments are alleged to have occurred on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">multiple occasions and included large payments in figures of thousands of pounds. In her oral</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">evidence, DAC Akers said that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref70" href="#footnote70">70</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;There also appears to have been a culture at the Sun of illegal payments, and</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">systems have been created to facilitate those payments, whilst hiding the identity of</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the officials receiving the money. The emails indicate that payments to sources were</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">openly referred to within the Sun, in which case the source is not named, but rather</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">the category &#8220;public official&#8221; is identified, rather than the name&#8221;.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-26"><a href="#para2-26" name="para2-26">2.26</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The consequence of this disclosure by the MSC has led the police to the investigation of those</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to whom payments were made. This has revealed evidence to suggest that the practice of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">payments to public officials, including police officers, may have taken place at other titles</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">outside the NI titles.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref71" href="#footnote71">71</a></sup> In her evidence to the Inquiry in July 2012, Ms Akers said that the MPS</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">both Trinity Mirror Group (TMG) and the Express News Group (the Express). The MPS now</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">believes that a number of stories published in the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror, the Daily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Star and the Star on Sunday, were obtained through such payments.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref72" href="#footnote72">72</a></sup> As a consequence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of this disclosure, an employee of TMG and an employee of the Express were arrested by</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">officers working on Operation Elveden. This has led the police to seek the assistance of both</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">those groups, requesting evidential material relating to these arrests.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref73" href="#footnote73">73</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-27"><a href="#para2-27" name="para2-27">2.27</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although not relevant to the MSC, it is appropriate here to note that TMG and the Express</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">have taken different approaches to the requests for information requests from the MPS.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Specifically, TMG has asked the MPS to obtain a production pursuant to PACE which it is said</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">will not be opposed; the Express has stated that the company would be prepared voluntarily</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">to share documents through an agreed system, similar to that operated by the MSC; at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">time of Ms Akers&#8217; evidence, no such protocol had been put in place.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref74" href="#footnote74">74</a></sup></span>
<h4>A critical view of the MSC</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-28"><a href="#para2-28" name="para2-28">2.28</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Although the MSC operates independently of NI and News Corp, its independence has</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">not gone unchallenged by some witnesses to the Inquiry. Brian Paddick, a former Deputy</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Assistant Commissioner of the MPS, has raised doubts over the ability of the MSC to conduct</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">an impartial and transparent investigation. The fact that News Corp was responsible for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the establishment of the MSC has led Mr Paddick to believe that the MSC was potentially</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">susceptible to the influence of News Corp executives and staff, and that this alleged influence</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">may have an impact on both its investigations and cooperation with the MPS.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref75" href="#footnote75">75</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-29"><a href="#para2-29" name="para2-29">2.29</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Paddick also explained his lack of faith in the credibility in the system of disclosure.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He expressed concerns that the MSC might withhold potential evidence from the MPS,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">particularly as the disclosure of material is voluntary, noting that reliance has been placed on</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">cooperation rather than a production order sought pursuant to the legislative powers set out</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">in PACE.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref76" href="#footnote76">76</a></sup> Commenting specifically on the disclosure of evidence by the MSC in relation to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">internal review of the practices at The Sun, Mr Paddick said that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref77" href="#footnote77">77</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;The difficulty is &#8211; and as she (Sue Akers) is saying, for example, all the issues that</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">we&#8217;ve had around the Sun newspaper she never asked for. It&#8217;s been volunteered by</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">this committee. What information are they not volunteering that Sue Akers is not</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">aware of?&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He also suggested that the MSC had an advantage in so far that it was potentially able to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">withhold material from the MPS investigations, by claiming journalistic privilege:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref78" href="#footnote78">78</a></sup></span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;...whilst it&#8217;s maybe ... it is independent of News International, it&#8217;s not independent</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">police. If that committee decides that actually, as far as they&#8217;re concerned, there&#8217;s no</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">criminal implications, that it is subject to journalistic privilege, then that committee</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">does not reveal the information that the police are asking for.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-30"><a href="#para2-30" name="para2-30">2.30</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Paddick has also criticised the lead role of the MPS in the investigations of allegations of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">corrupt payments made to police officers, as well as public officials. He expressed reservations</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at the putative neutrality of the MPS, explaining that he feared that public perceptions risked</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">becoming skewed by the fact that the investigation into the alleged corruption of MPS officers</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">was being conducted by the very police force under investigation. Although Mr Paddick</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">made specific acknowledgement of the integrity of both DAC Akers and the Commissioner</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">of the MPS, Mr Paddick has made clear that he remained concerned that the MPS could not</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">objectively investigate alleged corruption within their own force. He has suggested that an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">external police force, one which was not implicated in the current investigations, should have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">been appointed independently to investigate the alleged wrongdoing which has taken place.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He told the Inquiry that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref79" href="#footnote79">79</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;some people may not be convinced by the current arrangements and it may</span>

<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be better if it was an outside force who were investigating, purely from a public</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">perception point of view. But I am not in any way casting doubt on either Sue Akers&#8217;</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">integrity, nor the head of the MSC&#8230;&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-31"><a href="#para2-31" name="para2-31">2.31</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The suggestion was also raised during Mr Paddick&#8217;s oral evidence that it would be difficult to</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">find an independent force with senior officers who did not have previous experience at the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MPS, but Mr Paddick maintained that this could be achieved, and that it would be better in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">terms of public perception if the MPS were unaffiliated with the investigation. He said:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref80" href="#footnote80">80</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;itispossible tofindACPOofficerswhohavenoprevioushistorywiththeMetropolitan</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">Police who could lead up this investigation. Whether they would be better at it, I don&#8217;t</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">know, but in terms of public perception, I&#8217;m saying that it might be better.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-32"><a href="#para2-32" name="para2-32">2.32</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Paddick has also voiced concerns at the risk of collusive behaviour between the MPS and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">NI. Specifically, he was concerned at what could happen should the MPS investigations, or the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">MSC reviews of the NI titles, uncover evidence which placed either party in an unfavourable</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">position in the public eye. He explained his concerns using a hypothetical example:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref81" href="#footnote81">81</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;perhaps somebody very senior in the Metropolitan Police is seen to be having</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">received inappropriate payments from somebody very senior in News International,</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">how it might be in the interests of Rupert Murdoch or News Corp and in the interests</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of the Metropolitan Police for that not to be made public.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-33"><a href="#para2-33" name="para2-33">2.33</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mr Paddick suggested that it may be possible for the MPS and NI to work together to disguise</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">or hide incriminating evidence in order to protect the reputation of either organisation. In his</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">response to questions from Counsel to the MPS, Neil Garnham QC, Mr Paddick remained of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the view that he had<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;&#8230;difficulty</span><span style="font-style:italic"> in</span><span style="font-style:italic"> having</span><span style="font-style:italic"> complete</span><span style="font-style:italic"> confidence&#8221;</span> in the MPS investigations for</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the reasons he has elucidated.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref82" href="#footnote82">82</a></sup> Although Mr Garnham was at pains to address a number of</span>

<!--new page--><span style="font-size: 15px;">external factors which would prevent such collusion, including oversight of Operation Elveden</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the IPCC, Mr Paddick insisted that the investigation:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref83" href="#footnote83">83</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;should be led by a senior office from another force who has had no previous service</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">with the Metropolitan Police.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">He also expressed his concerns about the independence of the IPCC but did not elaborate</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">further.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-34"><a href="#para2-34" name="para2-34">2.34</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">DAC Akers has also addressed the concerns raised by Mr Paddick, by emphasising the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">fundamental importance of the professional and productive relationship the MPS has built</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">with the MSC. She stressed that the independence of the MSC from NI and the structure it</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">operates within:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref84" href="#footnote84">84</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;goes a long way to allay some criticisms that have been made about how it&#8217;s</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">perceived that it can&#8217;t be necessarily an independent inquiry. The fact that we are</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">dealing with the MSC directly and not News International I think should make any</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">contention that it isn&#8217;t independent without foundation.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-35"><a href="#para2-35" name="para2-35">2.35</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">As testament to the important contribution that the MSC has made to the investigation, DAC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Akers noted that, as at the date of her fourth witness statement, namely 31 October 2012,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the disclosure of material to Operation Elveden had led to the arrest of 25 journalists out of a</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">total of 52 arrests; this was in addition to 25 arrests made as part of Operation Weeting and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">17 arrests as part of Operation Tuleta.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref85" href="#footnote85">85</a></sup></span>

<p id="para-id-2-36"><a href="#para2-36" name="para2-36">2.36</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In forming a view about these matters, I am primarily reliant on the evidence provided by DAC</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Akers (about whom nobody has spoken other than in terms of the highest praise) although I</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">also have professional experience of Lord Grabiner and knowledge of his high standing as an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independent barrister in England and Wales. Furthermore, I am able to draw inferences from</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the nature and extent of what has happened as events have unfolded. On the other hand,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">there has been no evidence to support the concerns raised by Mr Paddick, either as to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">independence of the MSC or to the impartiality and integrity of the MPS officers responsible</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">for the conduct of its investigation into alleged police corruption and other crime.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-37"><a href="#para2-37" name="para2-37">2.37</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The purpose of the MSC has been to re-establish (or establish) a reputation in NI as a company</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that takes its obligations to the law very seriously and is determined to root out criminality</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">wherever it has existed and whomever it has involved, albeit recognising that some difficult</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">decisions might have to be made in relation to journalistic privilege. In the light of events,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">neither News Corp nor NI can do less if the purpose is to be achieved. It is obviously important</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">that News Corp, NI and the MSC continue in the resolve that has now been shown.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-38"><a href="#para2-38" name="para2-38">2.38</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I ought to make it clear that I am not at all critical of Mr Paddick for raising these concerns</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">which I have no doubt are legitimate and ventilated in good faith, based on the history of this</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">investigation and seared by his own experience both of NI and the MPS. For my part, however,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">I am fully satisfied as to the way in which the police are now conducting this investigation</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">(to which considerable resources have been devoted doubtless because of the reputational</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">damage that the MPS has suffered) and as to the integrity of the officers involved.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Equally, albeit without resolving the present differences between the MPS and the MSC, I have</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">seen no evidence to undermine the view expressed by DAC Akers as to the independence of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the MSC and its effectiveness as an independent arbiter in accordance with its remit. I am</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">satisfied that sufficient safeguards (by way of protocols and otherwise) have been put in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">place to dispel legitimate concerns along the lines that he has raised.</span>
<h4>Findings and progress of the MSC</h4>

<p id="para-id-2-40"><a href="#para2-40" name="para2-40">2.40</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">On 1 May 2012, the MSC announced the completion of its internal reviews of the three NI</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">titles, that is to say The Times, The Sunday Times and The Sun.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref86" href="#footnote86">86</a></sup> Rupert Murdoch, in an</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">address to NI staff, has been quoted in relation to the findings of the reviews of The Times</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and The Sunday Times, saying there was:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref87" href="#footnote87">87</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;no evidence of illegal conduct other than a single incident reported months ago&#8221;.</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">This single incident is thought to refer to the activities of the former Times journalist in</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">relation to gaining unlawful access to one or more personal emails.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-41"><a href="#para2-41" name="para2-41">2.41</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">No further details have been announced in relation to findings of the internal review of</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">The Sun. Neither has the MSC released further documentation to the MPS following the</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">completion of its review of The Sun. DAC Akers put the matter in this way:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref88" href="#footnote88">88</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;the MSC would say the result of the review was the material that they had disclosed</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">to us, but we haven&#8217;t received or -- I understand there is no formal report as a result</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">of their review.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Neither has the Inquiry heard any evidence in relation to the findings of the reviews conducted</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">by the MSC. In the light of the quantity of evidence that has emerged from these titles and</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">the evidence of DAC Akers, no further information has been sought.</span>

<p id="para-id-2-42"><a href="#para2-42" name="para2-42">2.42</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">In the meantime, the MSC has also begun to implement governance reforms in the newspaper</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">titles at NI. These reforms include improving policies relating to anti-bribery, whistleblowing</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and payments. These changes have been implemented through the office of Gerson weifach</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">and appropriate information relating to them has been disseminated to employees and staff</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">at NI.<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref89" href="#footnote89">89</a></sup> The Inquiry has not heard any evidence relating to these specific reforms by the MSC,</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">although Thomas Mockridge, Chief Executive Officer of NI, informed the Inquiry in October</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">2011 that:<sup class="footnoteref"><a name="footnoteref90" href="#footnote90">90</a></sup></span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">&#8220;&#8230;it is appropriate that compliance within NI be strengthened immediately. I have</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">therefore not waited for the output of the reviews... I have implemented, or am in the</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">process of implementing, new policies&#8230; Current policies, practices and systems may</span>
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 15px;">be adjusted later in line with the findings of the reviews.&#8221;</span>

<p id="para-id-2-43"><a href="#para2-43" name="para2-43">2.43</a></p>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Finally, it is worth noting the costs of the MSC to NI have been borne by the UK subsidiary</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">rather than by News Corp. From the Group Report and Financial Statement, as at 8 May 2012,</span>
